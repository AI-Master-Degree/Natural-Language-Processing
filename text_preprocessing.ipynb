Lithe, strong-limbed and firm-bodied,\\r\\nof peasant stock and peasant vigor, youth and health and the open\\r\\ncountry air were not factors sufficiently unfamiliar to combine in a\\r\\ncharm that would attract admiration in her own community.  Only a\\r\\njaded city-gaze--and a well-trained city-gaze at that--would have\\r\\nseen in the blue eyes, the red mouth, the straight nose, pink cheeks,\\r\\nand abundant russet hair, any promise worthy of fulfillment,--could\\r\\nhave detected the flower in the bud; and that such a gaze should, on\\r\\nthis day of all days, have been leveled in the girl\\'s direction was,\\r\\nperhaps, only one of those grim jests of a Fate that loves to play\\r\\nupon the harmony between man and nature, and that here observed the\\r\\ncoming of a human spring that must be brief and sudden, a human\\r\\nsummer parching and intense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual group of idle residents and idling commercial drummers were\\r\\nsitting at the plate-glass window of the hotel as she went by, but\\r\\nthe girl did not see them.  Passing among objects of long\\r\\nfamiliarity, she saw, in fact, nothing until, in a side-street, she\\r\\nheard a rapid step behind her, was covered by an approaching shadow\\r\\nand, half-turning, found someone, a stranger, at her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How d\\'y\\'do, liddle girl?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked up; but she was quite too startled to observe anything\\r\\nsave that the speaker--she could not have told whether he were man or\\r\\nboy--was at once dark and rosy, smiling and serious, hat in hand,\\r\\nand, beyond all speculation, no citizen of her own borough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know you,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flushed quickly, and strode forward.  It was, she knew, no\\r\\nuncommon thing for the girls of her acquaintance to be \"picked up,\"\\r\\nas they called the process, by some fellow-townsman that had never\\r\\nbeen formally presented to them; but the process was, as she also\\r\\nknew, one that lost its propriety when extended to aliens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present alien was, nevertheless, not easily to be dismissed.  He\\r\\nfell into her gait, and walked facilely beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your _par_don,\" he said in the humblest and most\\r\\nunobjectionable tones.  \"I don\\'t mean to be _rude_ to you, honest, I\\r\\ndon\\'t.  I\\'m a traveling-man, you see----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was striding rapidly ahead, her full mouth now drawn firm, her\\r\\nblue eyes fixed on the vanishing-point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care what you are,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All righd,\" he pleaded.  \"All I vant now is a chanc\\'t to _exblain_.\\r\\nI\\'ve chust started out traveling for my fader, who\\'s a big distiller\\r\\nin N\\'York.  I\\'ve got to stay in this hole for a vhile, un\\' I\\'m not\\r\\nused to the _bees_ness, un\\' I\\'m lonesome, un\\' I only vondered if you\\r\\nvouldn\\'t go vith me to a moving-picture show, or something, this\\r\\nevening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best way to deal with such a situation is a way that is easiest\\r\\nfor the inexperienced and the unpolished.  Mary was both.  For the\\r\\nfirst time since he had begun to walk beside her, she now, coming to\\r\\na defiant stop, faced her annoyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know you,\" she repeated.  \"I\\'ve told you that onc\\'t, and\\r\\nyou\\'d better not make me tell you any more still.  I live the second\\r\\ndoor round the coming corner, and my pop is a puddler an\\' weighs two\\r\\nhundred and ten pounds!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she wheeled and again resumed her homeward march; and this time\\r\\nshe walked alone.  If she heard, dimly, behind her a confused murmur\\r\\nof response, she did not hesitate to learn whether the words were\\r\\nexpressions of further apology or new-born dismay, and when she ran,\\r\\nflushed and panting, up the three wooden steps to the two-story brick\\r\\nhouse that was her home, though she could not then deny herself one\\r\\nbackward glance, that glance revealed to her only an empty corner.\\r\\nThe pursuit had ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flung open the light door that was never locked by day, walked\\r\\ndown the short, darkened hall, past the curtain of the equally\\r\\ndarkened parlor, through the dining-room with its pine table covered\\r\\nby a red cotton cloth, and so into the small, crowded kitchen, where\\r\\nher mother fretted and clattered above the highly polished range.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh was a little Pennsylvania-German woman, whom a stern\\r\\nreligion and a long life of hard work had not intellectually\\r\\nenlarged.  In spite of the fact that she had borne eight children, of\\r\\nwhom Mary was the seventh, her sympathies had failed to broaden, and\\r\\nher equally religious and equally hard-working Welsh husband used\\r\\noften to remark to her, during his one-monthly evening of\\r\\nintoxication, that he was glad indeed she was to have no more\\r\\nprogeny, since, somehow or other, she \"seemed to git wuss tempered\\r\\nwith every innocent youngling as koom to \\'un.\"  Whether this\\r\\ncriticism was or was not precise, it is at least true that much\\r\\ndrudgery had not improved the weary woman\\'s temper; that the long\\r\\nyears before her husband rose to his present wages--years during\\r\\nwhich his wife had not only kept a house and reared a family, but had\\r\\nalso added to the communal income by night-work as a dress-maker--had\\r\\nleft her gray and stooped and hatchet-faced; and that, though of a\\r\\nrace in which the maternal instinct runs almost to a passion, her\\r\\npatience with her remaining pair of home-biding children was\\r\\nfrequently fragile and short.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust now she looked up, a spoon in one hand and a pan in the other,\\r\\nher forehead damp, as always, with sweat, and her harassed eyes\\r\\nmomentarily bright with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where on earth have you been, anyways?\" she shrilly inquired of Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\'s face instantly hardened from the excitement of her recent\\r\\nadventure to the sullenness behind which she always took refuge in\\r\\nthese more usual domestic crises.  What she might have confessed had\\r\\nshe come home to a less overworked mother, it is, obviously, vain to\\r\\nconjecture; what she actually did was to lock within her breast the\\r\\nstory that had been trembling on her red lips, and what she replied\\r\\nto Mrs. Denbigh\\'s question was an ungracious:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Been at school.  Where d\\'you think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother straightened up as far as her long-stooped shoulders would\\r\\npermit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think?\" she echoed.  \"I guess I can guess still where you was.\\r\\n\\'Less you was kep\\' in, you had ought t\\' been home five minutes ago,\\r\\nan\\' nobody\\'s kep\\' in only five minutes.  You\\'ve been flirtin\\' with\\r\\nsome idiot of a boy on the street-corner yet--that\\'s about what\\r\\nyou\\'ve been doin\\'!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a random shot, and one fired from no previous knowledge, but\\r\\nthe girl at once realized that, had any neighbor chanced to see what\\r\\nhad actually occurred, this parental construction would appear to\\r\\nhave some foundation in fact.  The thought was enough to seal the\\r\\nlocked gate in her breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That ain\\'t so!\" she said, with childish fury.  \"I come straight\\r\\nhome, like I always do.  If you want me to help more with the work\\r\\nthan I do help, why don\\'t you let me quit school?  I don\\'t want to go\\r\\nany more, anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some families in which the passing of the lie is no such\\r\\nuncommon or serious offense, and the Denbigh _ménage_ was one of\\r\\nthem.  It was, therefore, upon the latter portion of Mary\\'s speech\\r\\nthat her mother, at this time, seized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll go to school as long as your pop and me say you must!\" she\\r\\nretorted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You let our Etta quit when she was in the grammar school,\"\\r\\nexpostulated Mary, with an appeal to the precedent of the\\r\\nsuccessfully married sister, who was now a next-door neighbor.  \"You\\r\\nlet her quit then, and now I\\'m in the high.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Mrs. Denbigh\\'s rejoinder been in accordance with the facts, she\\r\\nwould have said that all she wanted to do was to give her daughter as\\r\\nmuch of an education as was compatible with the proper conduct of the\\r\\nDenbigh domestic economy.  But tired women are no more apt to indulge\\r\\nin analytical exposition than are tired men, and so it chanced that\\r\\nher next speech, accompanied by a gesture that raised the\\r\\ncooking-spoon aloft, was a torrent of words unexpectedly interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the high?\" she repeated.  \"Well, I know where you\\'ll be in one\\r\\nminute, still, if you don\\'t right away----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe brought the spoon forward with a mighty swoop, but its parabola,\\r\\nin crossing the stove, sent it into violent contact with the pot that\\r\\nheld the stew destined for the noon dinner.  The pot was balanced on\\r\\nthe edge of an aperture in the stove whence the lid had been removed.\\r\\nThe vessel fell, and its contents belched upon the burning coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh gave one look at the steaming ruin, and then seized the\\r\\nalready retreating Mary.  The girl\\'s struggles, her cries, the\\r\\ndignity of the newly lengthened skirt, avail nothing.  A dozen times\\r\\nthe mother\\'s arm descended in stinging castigation, and then she\\r\\nhurried her daughter into the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You git right back to school!\" she ordered.  \"I don\\'t care if you\\'re\\r\\na half-hour early--you\\'re mostly late enough.  You\\'ve spoiled your\\r\\nown dinner and mine and little Sallie\\'s, so you don\\'t git nothin\\' to\\r\\neat still till evening.  You\\'ll go to school, and you\\'ll keep on\\r\\ngoin\\' till your pop an\\' me tells you to quit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at the woman without a word, and then, still without a\\r\\nword, passed through the front door and banged it behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she did not walk in the direction of the school; she was not\\r\\ngoing to school.  The rebel-spirit of youth choked her, and turned\\r\\nher feet, almost without will of her own, toward the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe crossed the railroad tracks, came to the disused towpath and\\r\\nfollowed it for a mile beyond the town.  Far westward she went,\\r\\n\"walking,\" as she would have said, \"her madness down,\" and, hungry\\r\\nthough she now was, she did not rest until at last, as late as three\\r\\no\\'clock in the afternoon, she sat on a rock at the point where the\\r\\nSusquehanna curves between the sheer precipice of Chicques on the\\r\\nLancaster County side and the hooded nose of the high hill they call\\r\\nthe Point, upon the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flood of rebellion had ceased, but a steady and enduring stream\\r\\nof resolution remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the sweep of eddies she saw the nearer hills already shedding\\r\\nthe browns and blacks of winter\\'s bared limbs and pine branches for\\r\\nthe tenderer green of a gentler season.  The cultivated portions of\\r\\nthe summits were already rich with coming life.  Behind her rolled\\r\\nthe Donegal Valley, where the crops were even then germinating.\\r\\nBirds were mating in the sap-wet trees beside the water, and from the\\r\\nflowering seeds there came the subtle, poignant scent of a warm April.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething--something new and nameless and wonderful--rose in her\\r\\nthroat and left her heart hammering an answer to the new world around\\r\\nher.  She was glad--glad in spite of all her anger and her hunger;\\r\\nglad that she had not told her mother of the boy--for he must have\\r\\nbeen a boy--whom she had, after all, so needlessly reprimanded; but\\r\\nglad, above everything else, for some reason, for some intoxication\\r\\nthat she might neither then nor ever after completely understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cheeks glowed a deeper pink; her blue eyes glistened; she opened\\r\\nher red mouth to the seductive sun and, with a sweep of her firm\\r\\nhands, flung loose her russet hair to the breeze.  Looking out at the\\r\\ndistant fields, she sprang to her feet again and walked, swaying with\\r\\nthe easy, languid grace of an unstudied young animal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fields reminded her of the rural prophets.  It was evident, she\\r\\nthought, that they were right: this year\\'s was to be a spring brief\\r\\nand sudden, a summer parching and intense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nA DEED OF TRUST\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Denbigh could not remember the day when the holy estate of\\r\\nmatrimony had not been held up to her by others as the whole destiny\\r\\nof woman and had not presented itself as the natural, the easy, the\\r\\nsole path of escape from filial servitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe belonged, as has been intimated, to a race in which motherhood is\\r\\nan instinctive passion and an economic necessity, and she was born\\r\\ninto a class in which not to marry is socially shameful and\\r\\nmaterially precarious.  When she was very small, her own dolls were\\r\\nher own children and her playmates\\' dolls her children-in-law, and,\\r\\nwhen she grew older, she had always before her the sedulously\\r\\nmaintained illusion of emancipation worn by those girls, but a few\\r\\nyears her seniors, who had given up the drudgery of childhood, which\\r\\nshe hated, for the drudgery of wifehood, which they loftily\\r\\nconcealed.  A young wife was a superior being, whose condition was\\r\\nnot at all to be judged by the known condition of one\\'s mother, and\\r\\nall the other and more intimate relations of marriage remained, to\\r\\nthe uninitiate, a charmed mystery.  If it seems strange to us that\\r\\nthis mystery and this innocence remained to Mary at sixteen, the\\r\\nreflection rests not upon her from whom the secret kept its secrecy,\\r\\nbut upon us to whom the innocence appears remarkable.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a house that exacted everything and forgave nothing, a narrow\\r\\nhouse, which she could not see as simply an inevitable result of\\r\\nconditions as wide as the world, the girl looked out to that\\r\\nwonderful house next door where her sister had, only three years\\r\\nbefore, been taken as a bride.  This sister was now an elegant\\r\\nperson, who said \"fore-head,\" \"of-ten,\" and \"a-gain,\" but Mary could\\r\\nremember Etta, in gingham frock and apron, performing the tasks that\\r\\nwere now enforced upon Mary herself.  And she could now observe--as,\\r\\nindeed, her sister\\'s wholly conscious pride well intended that she\\r\\nshould observe--Etta in clothes that were beyond the reach of an\\r\\nunmarried daughter of Owen Denbigh; Etta going to dances forbidden to\\r\\na Denbigh maid.  When she climbed reluctantly to bed at ten o\\'clock,\\r\\nEtta\\'s lights blazed always wide awake, and when she rose in the gray\\r\\nof the morning, Etta\\'s shutters were luxuriously closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery dawn Mary must pack her father\\'s dinner-bucket, as Etta used to\\r\\npack it, before Owen started for the mill.  That done, and the\\r\\nhurried breakfast eaten, she must make her own bed and wash the\\r\\ndishes before she set out for school.  At noon there were more\\r\\ndishes, and only every other evening, before sitting down to detested\\r\\nstudy by the kerosene lamp in the dining-room, was she relieved of\\r\\nstill more dish-washing by the growing, and apparently too favored,\\r\\nyounger sister, Sallie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening that followed Mary\\'s truant walk along the river was one\\r\\nof those when she should have been granted this modicum of relief,\\r\\nbut now, after the brief five o\\'clock supper, tow-headed Sallie set\\r\\nup a wail as the table was cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you now?\" demanded Mrs. Denbigh, her harassed\\r\\neyes blinking in the lamplight, and her hatchet-face more than\\r\\ncommonly sharp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t feelin\\' good,\" said Sallie.  \"I\\'m tired; I\\'m sick; I don\\'t\\r\\nwant to wash no dishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh shot a glance through the double-doorway to the littered\\r\\nparlor; but the face of her unattentive husband was hidden behind the\\r\\ncrinkling sheets of the _Daily Spy_, gripped by one great, grimy\\r\\nfist, while the stubby forefinger of the other hand spelled out the\\r\\nshort syllables of the personal-column, facetiously headed \"Our\\r\\nCard-Basket.\"  His huge bulk bulged over all the edges of the\\r\\nuncomfortable patent armchair in which he was sitting: a picture of\\r\\ngorged contentment, there was as yet no help to be expected from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Mary, experienced in such attacks, who made ready to defend\\r\\nthe law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ain\\'t sick,\" she declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am, too!\" sniffed Sallie.  \"I\\'m awful sick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get out: you et more\\'n I did.  You just want to make me do the work,\\r\\nan\\' I won\\'t, \\'cause it\\'s your turn.  So there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s homecoming had, as it happened, not been the signal for a\\r\\nrenewal of hostilities between her mother and herself.  The former\\r\\nhad just then been too hard at work to have either energy or thought\\r\\nin that direction, and throughout the evening meal the girl had\\r\\ndeemed it wise to maintain a reticence calculated to keep her in the\\r\\ndomestic background.  Now, however, she had impulsively come forward,\\r\\nand the step at once brought her to Mrs. Denbigh\\'s attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After what you done this noon,\" she said to Mary, \"you\\'d better keep\\r\\nyour mouth shut.  Go and wash them dishes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary knew that she had now gone too far to retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t my fault the stew was spilled,\" she protested; \"and\\r\\nanyhow, you did lick me onc\\'t for that.  Sallie just wants to shove\\r\\nher work off on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t,\" blubbered Sallie.  \"I\\'ll do \\'em some evenin\\' when it\\'s\\r\\nyour turn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Mary sneered, \"I know how you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will--I will--I will so!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSallie\\'s voice rose to a shrill shriek, and then suddenly broke off\\r\\nin the middle of a note: there was a sound of elephantine stirring\\r\\nfrom the parlor, and the feared master of the house, moved at last\\r\\nfrom his lethargy, rolled into the double doorway and seemed nearly\\r\\nto block it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the young reporters of _The Spy_ had once remarked--not in\\r\\nprint--that Owen Denbigh resembled nothing so much as the stern of an\\r\\narmored cruiser seen from a catboat.  How much of the covering of his\\r\\npowerful frame was fat and how much muscle is matter for conjecture;\\r\\nhis life in the iron mills had certainly given him a strength at\\r\\nleast approaching the appearance, and had blackened his large hands,\\r\\nreddened his big face, and grayed his bristling hair and his fiercely\\r\\nflaring mustache.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whad\\'s ahl this devil\\'s racket?\" he shouted, in the voice he used in\\r\\ntriumphing over the turmoil of the puddling-furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth children quailed before him, each prepared regardless of its\\r\\nmerits, for acquittal or condemnation, as he might decide the issue.\\r\\nEven Mrs. Denbigh drew back and set her lips to silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant raised a threatening hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be ye ahl gone deef?\" he demanded.  \"Whad\\'s ahl this devil\\'s racket\\r\\nfur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a panic of self-preservation, the two girls began at once to\\r\\nclamor forth their woes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sallie won\\'t wash the dishes!\" cried Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sick,\" sobbed Sarah, \"an\\' mom says Mary must wash \\'em because\\r\\nshe upset the stew this noon-time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the merits of any case brought before him, the household Solomon\\r\\nwas as little interested as if he had been the judge of a law-court.\\r\\nHis years of overwork had limited his sense of a just division of\\r\\ntoil among others, and his long oppression by task-masters had made\\r\\nhimself a merciless task-master.  Like the men that had driven him,\\r\\nhe delighted most in driving those who were the hardest to drive.\\r\\nSallie was too young to furnish appreciable resistance, but in the\\r\\nawakening Mary he now saw something that approached worthy\\r\\nopposition.  He turned first to his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you tell \\'er,\" he inquired, his stubby forefinger leveled at\\r\\nMary--\"did you tell \\'er to wash \\'un?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh bowed her sweating forehead in timid assent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the father looked again at the offender.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wash \\'un!\" he ordered, and marched back to his parlor, his armchair,\\r\\nand his evening paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary knew her father too well not to know also the price of\\r\\ndisobedience.  Sullenly, but without hesitation, she retreated to the\\r\\nlittle kitchen and took up her uncongenial task.\\r\\n\\r\\nGirlhood, then, must be denied much of its claim to recreation; the\\r\\nsocial machine was pitiless.  Young life was a period of menial\\r\\nservice from which the sole escape was marriage, whether to stranger\\r\\nor to friend.  That a stranger should harm her was, to Mary--as it is\\r\\nto most girls of her age and environment--an idea unentertained:\\r\\nstrangers were too few, and the world of moral fact too closely shut\\r\\nand guarded.  Boys she had always been cautioned against in vague\\r\\ngeneralities; but she understood that they were prohibited because\\r\\ntheir company was a delectable luxury reserved for older and\\r\\nmarriageable girls whose younger sisters were needed only to help in\\r\\nthe household tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nRebellion once more reddened her heart--rebellion, as she thought,\\r\\nagainst her own particular condition, but the old rebellion,\\r\\nactually, that burns, at one time or another, in every heart: the\\r\\nrevolt of the individual, more or less conscious of its\\r\\nindividuality, against the conditions that are combined to crush it.\\r\\nShe poured the water from the heavy iron tea-kettle into the tin\\r\\ndishpan with a quick anger that was not eased when two or three of\\r\\nthe scalding drops leaped back against her bared, round arms.  She\\r\\nflung the home-boiled soap after the water, and she clattered the\\r\\ndishes as loudly as she dared.  Through the window--her soul hot with\\r\\nthe sense of the injustice done her--she could see the happy lights\\r\\nin Etta\\'s house, and, her hands deep in the greasy fluid, it came to\\r\\nher suddenly that she had been a fool to neglect--to\\r\\nrepudiate--to-day what might have been the golden chance to such an\\r\\nestate as her sister\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had heard the protesting Sarah sent to bed; had heard her mother\\r\\nreturn to the parlor with the sewing-basket, and, finally, as she was\\r\\nputting away the last of the dishes in the china-closet in the\\r\\ndining-room, she caught the voices of both of her parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nDimly glimpsed from the small apartment beyond, she knew the scene\\r\\nwell enough to reconstruct it perfectly.  The crowded little parlor\\r\\nwas like a hundred others in the immediate neighborhood, a\\r\\nmathematical result of the community of which it was a part.  There\\r\\nwere the two front windows with the horse-hair chairs before each\\r\\nand, between them, the marble-top table bearing the family Bible.\\r\\nThere was the gilt mirror over the gorgeously lambrequined\\r\\nmantelpiece, which was littered with a brass clock,\\r\\ndried-grass-bearing yellow vases, stiff photographs of dead or\\r\\nmarried younger Denbighs, and \"memorial cards\" with illegible gilt\\r\\nlettering upon a ground of black.  Close by the cabinet-organ on one\\r\\nside and the green sofa on the other--the sofa adorned with a lace\\r\\n\"tidy\" that would never remain neatly in its place--her father and\\r\\nmother sat, separated by the purple-covered center-table, their gaze\\r\\ninterrupted by the tall glass case that contained the bunch of white\\r\\n_immortelles_ from the grave of their eldest son.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh was finishing, it seemed, the narrative of the town\\'s\\r\\nlatest scandal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never knowed Mrs. Drumbaugh was that soft-hearted,\" the mother was\\r\\nsaying.  \"Nobody in town was fooled over the reason for why her\\r\\nJennie went away, an\\' yet here the girl comes back a\\'ready, and Mrs.\\r\\nDrumbaugh, church-member though she is, takes her into the house\\r\\nag\\'in--her an\\' her baby along with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it in the words that brought Mary to a sudden pause?  Her\\r\\nmother had always been, like most drudges, a gossip, and had sought,\\r\\nin repeating scandal about her acquaintances, that relief from\\r\\ndrudgery which she knew how to obtain only by this second-hand thrill\\r\\nof evil.  The girl had heard and disregarded the telling of many such\\r\\na tale, and yet, to-night, she stood there first listening in\\r\\nuncomprehending horror to the narrative and then awaiting the\\r\\ninevitable paternal comment upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tuke \\'er bahk, hey?\" rumbled Owen Denbigh.  \"Well, ef she bay sooch\\r\\na fule, she deserves the scandal ov\\'t.  Thank God no youngling o\\'\\r\\nourn ever went the devil\\'s way.  I hahve ahlways bin sure what I\\'d do\\r\\nto \\'un ef she did, though.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused a moment, as if to have his wife inquire as to the terrible\\r\\npunishment that he had reserved for such an error, and then, as no\\r\\ninquiry was forthcoming, he gave his statement at any rate, with all\\r\\nthe cold ferocity of a Judge Jeffries pronouncing sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bay \\'un thirty year old an\\' noot another sin ag\\'in \\'un,\" he\\r\\ndeclared, \"I would beat \\'un within a bare inch o\\' \\'er deeth, an\\' turn\\r\\n\\'un oot to live the life \\'un had picked fur herself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole intent of that speech Mary was incapable of comprehending,\\r\\nbut she understood enough to tremble and then to fan to destructive\\r\\nfury the fire of her rebellion.  Of a sudden, the atmosphere of the\\r\\nhouse had become unendurable.  She was gasping like a sparrow under a\\r\\nbell-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nStealthily she crept into the hall.  Carefully she took her coat and\\r\\nfaded hat from the rack.  Very gently she opened the front door and\\r\\nstole into the street.  She felt dumbly that the world was wrong,\\r\\nthat youth should not have to work, and that to seize the fruit of\\r\\npleasure should not be matter far punishment, but for congratulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think that she meant to pass by the hotel that evening.  I\\r\\ndo not believe that most of us, in such moments, are actuated any\\r\\nmore by motive than we are directed by discretion.  Nevertheless,\\r\\nwhen the clutch of her emotions had enough loosened from her throat\\r\\nto permit her to take account of her whereabouts, the time, and the\\r\\nplace, it was a quarter after six by the town-clock; Mary was just\\r\\nbefore the plate-glass window where the drummers sat, and, only a\\r\\nminute later, the stranger of the morning was again at her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Von\\'t you chust say that you\\'re not _mad_ vith me?\" he was asking.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was so frightened that she was conscious of no other definite\\r\\nsensation, much less of any ordered thought or opinion; but she\\r\\nlooked fairly at him, and of what she saw she was immediately fully\\r\\naware.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a young man, but the sort of young man that might be anywhere\\r\\nfrom nineteen to thirty-two, because he had the figure and the face\\r\\nof the former age and the eyes and the expression of the latter.  The\\r\\nhair on his head was black and curly; though his hands were not the\\r\\nworking-hands with which Mary was best acquainted, they were almost\\r\\ncovered with a lighter down of the same growth; and through the pale\\r\\nolive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks shone the blue-black hint of\\r\\na wiry beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thick when he did\\r\\nnot smile and thin when he did, with teeth very white; and his gray\\r\\nglance had a penetrating calculation about it that made the girl\\r\\ninstinctively draw her coat together and button it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo his speech she could pay, just then, scarcely any attention,\\r\\nexcept to feel that its quick, thick quality, and its ictus on the\\r\\nvowels, denoted the foreigner; but his clothes were a marvel that\\r\\nwould not be denied.  His coat and trousers of green were cut in the\\r\\nextreme of a fashion that was new to her; his brown plush hat was\\r\\nturned far down on one side and far up on the other; his waistcoat,\\r\\nof purple striped by white, was held by large mother-of-pearl\\r\\nbuttons, and his shoes, long and pointed, were the color of lemons.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpulsively she had refused an answer to his first words; but the\\r\\nyoung man was a member of the persistent race, and speedily followed\\r\\nthe first speech with a second.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chust say the vord,\" he pleaded, \"und I von\\' bother you no more.  I\\r\\nonly vanted to make myself _square_ vith you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary hesitated.  Something, she knew, she feared, but whether it was\\r\\nthe man, herself, or the habit of obedience she could not tell.  He\\r\\nwas polite, he was respectful; he came, it was clear, from a happier\\r\\nworld than her own--and, as against her own she was now in open\\r\\nrevolt, a certain parley with this visitor from an alien orb seemed\\r\\nlikely to constitute a fitting declaration of independence.\\r\\nConditions had worked upon her to desperation, and the same\\r\\nconditions, little as she guessed it, had, under the mask of chance,\\r\\ninevitably provided this avenue of protest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I\\'m not mad at you, if that\\'s what you want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad of that,\" he easily answered, as they turned, quite\\r\\nnaturally, away from the main street.  \"But I thought you gonsidered\\r\\nme _fresh_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I hadn\\'t never been introduced to you, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll introduce myself!\" said he.  \"My name\\'s Max Grossman--not my\\r\\nreal name, because I vas born in Hungary an\\' nobody could say my real\\r\\nname ofer here.  My fader is a big distiller in New York--he\\'s vorth\\r\\nhalf a million un\\' more: anybody\\'ll tell you about him.  \\'Und he\\'s\\r\\nput me on the road for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis and much more he told her in the following minutes.  He drew a\\r\\ntruly brilliant picture of his parental home, and, animadverting now\\r\\nand then with scorn on the town in which he now found himself, he\\r\\npainted in the highest colors the glory of Manhattan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York, it appeared, was a city of splendid leisure.  Its entire\\r\\nfour millions of population spent their days in rest and their nights\\r\\nin amusement.  There were the rumbling cable-cars, the roaring\\r\\nelevated trains, the subway expresses, which reached out and drew the\\r\\nBattery within twenty minutes of the Bronx.  There were the realities\\r\\nthat had been only vague magic names to this girl: the East Side, the\\r\\nBowery, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Waldorf.  Nobody went to\\r\\nbed before three o\\'clock in the morning, or woke before one in the\\r\\nafternoon.  Nobody was ugly and nobody was old.  There were no books\\r\\nto study, no errands to run, no dishes to wash.  There were only the\\r\\ncabs and the taxis to ride in, the hundred theaters to see, the cafés\\r\\nand the music, Fifth Avenue with its palaces, and Broadway, from\\r\\nThirty-fourth to Forty-third \"von big, yellow, happy electric lighd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe listened.  As he spoke, though she did not know it, the far-off\\r\\norchestras were calling her, as if the sound of the city deafened her\\r\\nto all other sounds, as if the lights of New York blinded her to the\\r\\nlights of home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own story, as she in turn briefly told it to him, provided her\\r\\nwith the one touch of contrast needed to make the lure of the new\\r\\ndream complete, provided him with the one text necessary for the\\r\\nimplications he frankly wanted her to receive.  She was already so\\r\\nmetropolitan that, when she agreed to go to the moving-picture show,\\r\\nshe passed the portals of \"The Happy Hour,\" as the place was\\r\\noptimistically entitled, with a superior scorn for all that it had to\\r\\noffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrow hall was dark when they entered--Max pocketing the large\\r\\nroll of yellow bills from which he had drawn the price of their\\r\\nadmission--and, as they sat down, half-way toward the stage, there\\r\\nwas being shown, on the screen, the absurd adventures of a tramp, who\\r\\nentered an ornate hotel grill-room and who, among wondering,\\r\\nwell-dressed guests, was proceeding to order an elaborate meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the _As_tor,\" whispered Max, loudly.  \"I\\'d know id anyvheres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pictured tramp was, of course, unable to pay his score, and,\\r\\nequally, of course, was pursued as he leaped through an open window.\\r\\n\\r\\nMax acted as Mary\\'s guide during the tableaux of the chase that\\r\\nfollowed.  Now the quarry was darting among the congested traffic of\\r\\nTimes Square; now he had clambered over the platform of a\\r\\nForty-second Street surface-car; now he was running up the steep\\r\\nstairway of the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" and now, the hunters close at his\\r\\nheels, he was dashing along Thirty-fourth Street past the Waldorf,\\r\\nturning down toward the Park Avenue Hotel, and so, at last, was\\r\\ncaught at the nearby entrance to the subway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the lights flared up at the conclusion of the little drama, Mary\\r\\nsighed as if suddenly plunged from fairyland down to the real world\\r\\nbelow.  And then the sigh changed to a gasp of fright: in the same\\r\\nrow, only six seats away, her sister Etta was sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl started to rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhat\\'s wrong?\" asked the astonished Max.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go.  Don\\'t come out with me.  Wait a minute, and then follow.\\r\\nI\\'ll be at the next corner up street.  That\\'s our Etta over there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Max did not seem fully to comprehend the warning.  He rose with\\r\\nMary, and made some stir in doing it, so that, as the pair reached\\r\\nthe aisle, Etta\\'s eyes were drawn in the direction of her sister and\\r\\nthe man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though she hastily turned her head, thought that she saw\\r\\nrecognition in this sudden glance.  She thought that she saw\\r\\nrecognition turn to amazement, and amazement to rebuke.  Instantly,\\r\\nthere rose before her the reefs of ultimate domestic disaster.  With\\r\\nMax in close attendance, she hurried to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside she did not speak until they had reached the comparative\\r\\nseclusion of a less frequented street.  Then she turned hotly upon\\r\\nthe youth, whom she considered the cause of her peril.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why was you such a fool?\" she demanded.  \"Didn\\'t you hear me say for\\r\\nyou not to come out when I did?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t understand you,\" Max humbly expostulated.  \"But vhat\\r\\ndifference does it make, anyvays?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Difference?  Why, you were so blamed noisy that Etta looked round\\r\\nan\\' seen me.  She\\'ll go straight home and tell pop I was here with\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell,\" protested Max, \"it\\'s not seven o\\'clock yet, und I\\'m not\\r\\neatin\\' you, vas I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That don\\'t matter.  You don\\'t know my pop!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhat\\'ll he do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll\"--Mary remembered previous punishments for smaller offenses,\\r\\nand recalled the judgment that she had heard her father pronounce on\\r\\na hypothetical offender.  \"He\\'ll beat me till I\\'m near dead,\" she\\r\\ndeclared; \"an\\' then, like as not, he\\'ll turn me out of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were at pause in the shadow of an old buttonwood tree, Max\\r\\nleaning against the gnarled trunk, the girl facing him, erect.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as she sketched her possible punishment, the possible became\\r\\nprobable.  She was afraid, and this young man, who had been so\\r\\ndeferential, so protecting, who had given her so alluring a glimpse\\r\\nof another world, seemed her only refuge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put out his hands and, gently, took both of hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that touch the last of her anger melted, almost to tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" he said.  \"I\\'ve been decent to you, haven\\'t I?  I ain\\'t\\r\\ntried to get fresh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head, not trusting speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell, then, listen here,\" he pursued.  \"If your old man gets gay,\\r\\nchust remember _that_.  You ain\\'t treated righd at home, the best of\\r\\ntimes.  You said so yourself.  Un\\' this here jay town\\'s no _place_\\r\\nfor a pretty young lady like you, anyvays.  So, if there\\'s any\\r\\ntrouble, you come for me, und I\\'ll get you avay from here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl thrilled with a delicious sense of adventure.  She trembled\\r\\nwith the foretaste of a new delight.  The passing praise of her looks\\r\\nand of her newly acquired maturity, a novel sound in her ears, was\\r\\nnot lost upon her; but even that was dwarfed by the tenor of her\\r\\ncompanion\\'s words, and the wonderful current that ran from his hands\\r\\nto hers.  Was this what had been meant, that truant afternoon, by the\\r\\ncalling birds, the leafing trees and the poignant air along the\\r\\nriver?  Was this what young women felt when lovers told their love?\\r\\nShe could not have formulated the questions, but her heart asked\\r\\nthem, and Max, meanwhile, was repeating:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll get you avay from here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How--how could you do it?\" she gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'d be dead easy.  If there\\'s any scrap, you vatch your chanc\\'t un\\'\\r\\ngive the house the slip.  I\\'ll be vaitin\\' at the hotel till midnight.\\r\\nDelephone me from the nearest drugstore, un\\' ve\\'ll take a trolley\\r\\ndown the line un\\' catch a train to N\\'York un\\' be married there this\\r\\nsame nighd.  I\\'ve a friend who\\'s a minister un\\' vill get out of his\\r\\nbed any hour I\\'d ask him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pressed her hands tighter, and, as he leaned against the tree,\\r\\ndrew her slightly toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary, though she did not know why, still fearful, held back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--we couldn\\'t do that,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhy not?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because--why, we couldn\\'t go away together, alone: it wouldn\\'t be\\r\\nright.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax straightened suddenly.  He released her hands and placed one\\r\\ntight arm about her waist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It vould be righd if I _lofed_ you,\" he said.  \"Und I do lof you.\\r\\nVe city folk, ve can\\'t do things slow-like you liddle town people.\\r\\nVhen I saw you this morning, I knew I liked you, because you vas so\\r\\ndifferent from all these rubes around here; un\\' vhen I talk vith you\\r\\nthis efenin\\' I know I lof you.  Listen here: you come avay with me\\r\\nto-_nighd_.  Ve vill go righd ofer to N\\'York, un\\' there ve get\\r\\nmarried righd avay.  No more school, nor dishvashin\\', nor scoldin\\'.\\r\\nYour own fader vill be pleased vhen it\\'s ofer, because my fader is\\r\\nreech, un\\' my fader vill be pleased too, because he\\'s been devilin\\'\\r\\nme to marry for more\\'n a ye-ar, only I nefer till now found a girl I\\r\\n_lof_.  Come on, Mary: I lof you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes swam in a mist.  They had come then--love and freedom, hand\\r\\nin hand.  Her soul grew faint within her.  She struggled a little,\\r\\nfluttering like a young bird in a capturing palm, but he drew her\\r\\ntighter, and his free hand passed electrically across her cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on avay!\" he urged softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I don\\'t know what to do!\" she panted.  \"Wait--wait \"--it was the\\r\\nancient cry of womanhood upon the brink--\"wait till to-morrow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a step behind them, which Max was the first to hear.  He\\r\\nfreed her, and they stood mute until the shadowy passer-by had gone.\\r\\nIt was an incident that at least lessened the spell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s all right,\" said Mary.  \"Perhaps Etta didn\\'t see me,\\r\\nan\\' I can tell \\'em I was over at my girl-friend\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s only puttin\\' off vhat\\'s got to happen _some_time,\" Max argued.\\r\\n\"This town\\'s no place for a girl like you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned toward her, but she drew, reluctantly, away.  What might be\\r\\nwell by day may well seem ill by night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait till to-morrow, anyhow,\" she urged.--But to-morrow, she\\r\\nwondered, how should she explain her afternoon away from school?\\r\\n\\r\\nMax considered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All righd,\" he at last nodded.  \"Go home un\\' think things ofer vith\\r\\nyourself; but I\\'ll be chust as ready to-morrow as I am to-day.\\r\\nYou\\'ve got to get avay from all this ugliness.  Remember that, un\\'\\r\\nremember I hafn\\'t been _fresh_, un\\' I vant righd now to marry you.  I\\r\\nhafn\\'t efen tried to kiss you.  Think of that, un\\' think that I\\'ll be\\r\\nvaitin\\' up at the hotel, in case of drouble, till _mid_nighd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wheeled at that, and left her.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later--at a quarter to seven, so rapidly had the drama\\r\\nunrolled itself--she had reached home to find that Etta had been\\r\\nthere before her.  Denbigh, on the early morning shift that week, was\\r\\nalready in bed, but her mother tossed the truant into the parlor and\\r\\nlocked both doors while she went up stairs to waken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came down at once, in his nightshirt, roaring.  He turned the key\\r\\nand flung wide the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room, however, was empty, and the window open.  Mary and Max were\\r\\nalready together, hurrying through the warm spring evening toward the\\r\\ntrolley-car that was to carry them on the first stage of their\\r\\njourney to New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SPECTER OF FEAR\\r\\n\\r\\nA sixteen an angry and frightened girl running away from a home where\\r\\nthe necessity for work must cheat her youth of its just rights--at\\r\\nsixteen such a girl cannot analyze her emotions, and Mary\\'s were in\\r\\nsheer panic.  She had never before been farther from her own town\\r\\nthan the ten miles\\' distant county-seat, had never before been at\\r\\nmore than verbal odds with her parents.  Philadelphia had stood for\\r\\nthe City of Lanterns, and a quick retort for revolution.  Now she was\\r\\nbound for New York and marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was none of the few persons on the trolley-car that knew her,\\r\\nyet she kept her face to the window and away from them.  There was no\\r\\nchance of capture, yet she trembled whenever the brakes creaked and a\\r\\nnew passenger came aboard.  It might, perhaps, be truly said that she\\r\\ndid not feel at all, and that the power of poignant realization was\\r\\nstill paralyzed by her own action.  It was as if she had amputated a\\r\\nportion of her spiritual being, and wras still numb from the shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever Max\\'s own feelings, he at any rate conducted himself in the\\r\\nmanner least calculated to rouse his companion.  He spoke only to\\r\\ngive the few necessary directions, and then in a low tone, not facing\\r\\nher, but looking straight ahead.  He had slipped her the money to pay\\r\\nher own fare and, the better to deceive whoever might follow them,\\r\\nhad told her to buy a round-trip ticket to a point beyond that for\\r\\nwhich they were bound.  With his lemon-colored shoes planted upon his\\r\\nsuitcase, he sat beside her, but he kept as wide a space between them\\r\\nas the short seat would permit; and it was only under the discreet\\r\\ncovering of the light overcoat upon his knee that he kept a tight and\\r\\nreassuring grasp of her firm hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a mile from the county-town they left the car--Mary first and Max\\r\\ntwenty yards behind--and then, for the competent young man seemed to\\r\\nhave prepared for everything, walked across the fields, under the\\r\\nstars, to a flag-station where, within a few minutes, they could\\r\\ncatch a New York express.  Arm in arm they walked, but Max never once\\r\\nfrightened her by a burst of affection, never once did more than to\\r\\nencourage her by plain statements of his loyalty and more ornate\\r\\ndescriptions of the life before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You vill _like_ it,\" he concluded.  \"I know you vill be happy, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s breath caught a little in her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye--yes,\" she answered.  \"Only, I can\\'t help thinking some about\\r\\nmom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure you can\\'t,\" Max immediately agreed.  \"You mustn\\'t led her vorry\\r\\nlonger than you can help it.  I tell you vhat ve\\'ll do.  Ofer here in\\r\\nthe station, you wride her a letter und I\\'ll haf it mailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but then pop would see it, an\\' he might follow us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\' gif no names or say vhere ve\\'re goin\\', und how can he?  By the\\r\\ntime he gets it, ve\\'ll be safe married, anyways.  Here ve are at the\\r\\nstation.  I\\'ve got some paper un\\' pencil und an envellup: I\\'ll tell\\r\\nyou chust vhat to wride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did tell her, and this note, given to the train-porter, was mailed\\r\\nfarther along the line:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Dear Mother_: Don\\'t please worry about me.  I will soon be back for\\r\\na visit, only I have gone to Buffalo to get married.  He is a nice\\r\\nyoung man and his father is rich, for I could not stand to have Pop\\r\\nbeat me, nor do other people\\'s work any more.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Your aff. daughter,\\r\\n        \"MARY DENBIGH.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train, which Max had duly signaled, had stopped just as the\\r\\nwriting was ended, and the pair of runaways had hurried into the last\\r\\nseat of the rear car.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the journey that followed, Mary\\'s nerves, accustomed to early\\r\\nhours, gave way not to tears, but to the exhaustion consequent upon\\r\\nthe strain of her crowded day.  Her hat in her lap, her russet hair\\r\\nmade a pillow for her against the sharp window-sill, and, with Max\\'s\\r\\ncoat piled at the pane to protect her from the keen arrows of the\\r\\ninrushing night air, she lay back, the pink cheeks and the red mouth\\r\\npaler than an hour since, and the blue eyes closed.  She did not seem\\r\\nto sleep, and yet it was in a dream that the ride ended, in a dream\\r\\nthat she found herself one of a hurrying crowd stamping down the\\r\\nplatform and into the huge elevator at the Jersey City station, in a\\r\\ndream that she clung faithfully to Max\\'s arm as the sudden lights and\\r\\ndamp odors struck her and as she dropped upon a straw-covered bench\\r\\nof a swaying car, which shot them immediately through a tunneled\\r\\ndarkness into the very depths of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew from her geography that New York was separated from New\\r\\nJersey by water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When do we cross the ferry, Max?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMax smiled, his thin lips showing his white teeth in sharp contrast\\r\\nto his olive skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re crossing it now,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But where\\'s the water?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax, mopping his dark forehead with a purple-bordered handkerchief,\\r\\npointed to the roof of the car.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up there,\" he said.  \"Ve\\'re in the tube, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not know, but she was too much ashamed of her rural ignorance\\r\\nfurther to discover it by unconsidered questions, and so full of a\\r\\npulsing wonder at what was to come next, so full of the expectation\\r\\nof the child at her first melodrama that she had place for no\\r\\nbackward thought.  She sat silent until they had come out of the\\r\\ntunnel, climbed a windy stair, and emerged upon a thoroughfare as\\r\\nmuch ablaze as if all the stars of heaven had descended to light it,\\r\\nand as brimming with moving life as her father\\'s mill at ten o\\'clock\\r\\nin the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nMax regarded the girl\\'s open-eyed wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" he said, \"ve\\'ll chust chump in a taxi un\\' go get a good\\r\\nsupper, un\\' then, vhile the vaiter\\'s filling our order, I\\'ll first do\\r\\na little delephoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put up his dark hand; a passing automobile, its tin flag raised,\\r\\nhummed up to the curb, and Mary, clinging timidly to the arm of her\\r\\nbetrothed, began her first ride in a taxicab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe street--it was Fourteenth Street, he told her--flared and seethed\\r\\nand spluttered before them.  As if leaning over the head of a runaway\\r\\nhorse, they shot in and out among clanging cable-cars, dashed by\\r\\nsnorting vehicles of their own sort, and nearly grazed jostling cabs\\r\\ndriven by cursing Jehus.  Even at that late hour, some of the shops\\r\\nwere still open, and the wide pavements on either side were black\\r\\nwith countermarching processions of people, moving with the steady\\r\\nrapidity and stolidity of a swarm of ants.  When the street ran by a\\r\\ntree-sprinkled square, its houses seemed to burst into still greater\\r\\nbrightness to atone for the darkness of the park.  Every second\\r\\nbuilding was a restaurant, a theater for moving-pictures, or a\\r\\nsaloon.  Their electric-signs now winked from nothingness to light,\\r\\nnow flashed forth a word, one letter at a time, and now were\\r\\nsurrounded with wriggling snakes of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came upon her--this vision of the absolutely new, of the city\\'s\\r\\nimmensity and teeming life--at a moment when her heart was ready for\\r\\nreaction, when memory was prepared to reassert itself, and when,\\r\\nanger gone and regret poised like a runner at the starting-line, her\\r\\nquick determination might have failed her.  But it came with\\r\\nstupefying force.  The dream of pleasure gave place for the moment to\\r\\na certainty of dread.  Vaguely, unreasoningly, but with the\\r\\nunquestioning acceptance of a child, she felt New York as a terrible,\\r\\nsolidified unity; as a vast, malevolent consciousness; as a living\\r\\nprison that implacably and resistlessly raised itself on every hand\\r\\nand on every hand shut her in forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe trembled and clung the tighter to her companion\\'s arm, and her\\r\\ncompanion was alert to note her agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhat\\'s the matter?\" he inquired, in a voice that he well meant to be\\r\\ntender.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I don\\'t know,\" she began, her red underlip indrawn.  \"I--aren\\'t\\r\\nwe goin\\' pretty fast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?  Us?  Vhy, I was chust thinking I\\'d tell him to hit up the pace\\r\\na little.  Are you scared?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer pride would not permit confession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" she lied; \"I\\'m not scared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are shivering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess I\\'m kind of chilly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All righd.  Chust vait a minute un\\' ve\\'ll soon be at the restaurant\\r\\nun\\' varm up.  You\\'ll like that restaurant: it\\'s von of the swellest\\r\\nin town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it\\'s pretty late,\" she ventured.  \"Your friend--are you sure\\r\\nhe----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?  The minister?\"  Max patted her hand with reassuring affection.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you vorry about him.  He\\'s all for me, und I\\'ll get him out of\\r\\nbed chust as soon as ve\\'ve ordered our supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few blocks more, and Max, aided by a marvelously tall person in a\\r\\nwonderful uniform, was helping her, with what she considered an\\r\\nelaborate courtesy, to dismount from the taxi, pass under a glass\\r\\nawning and, through a changing stream of hurrying waiters and\\r\\narriving and departing guests terribly arrayed, to climb a softly\\r\\ncarpeted stair and enter a brilliant balcony open to the street and\\r\\nfull of chattering men and women eating and drinking at a score of\\r\\ntables.  Even in her fright, it was with a touch of admiration that\\r\\nshe observed how Max--her Max--seemed to be known to the immediately\\r\\nattentive waiters, and how, smiling, they hurried to make way for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey secured a corner table, a relatively quiet corner table, and\\r\\nthere, with a servant standing by, pencil in hand, and with a huge\\r\\ndouble-paged menu-card before each of them, made ready for their meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chust you order vhatever you like,\" said Max.  \"Pretty near\\r\\neverything in the vorld\\'s on there, but if you vant anything that you\\r\\ncan\\'t see, chust you ask for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at the card.  In spite of all that had passed, and all\\r\\nthat now filled her heart, she was young, and youth is so fortunate\\r\\nas to be able to eat in the trough of any emotional sea.  She was a\\r\\nchild, and, by the sure logic of childhood, who-so thought to feed\\r\\nher could be nothing but a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe card, however, was of small assistance.  Its very size was\\r\\nappalling, and its offerings were made in an unfamiliar tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You get what you like,\" she at last submitted.  \"I\\'m so hungry I can\\r\\neat anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw her difficulty so well that he could rescue her from it\\r\\nwithout seeming to see it at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell, I\\'m vith you there,\" he said cheerfully, and proceeded to obey\\r\\nher, rattling off a list of dishes of no one of which she had ever\\r\\nheard before.  \"Un\\' have the Martinis dry,\" he cautioned in\\r\\nconclusion, \"vith a dash of absinthe in them--un\\' bring them righd\\r\\navay: I\\'m spittin\\' gotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter left, and, as he did so, Max again addressed the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excuse me for von minute,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary\\'s blue eyes opened wide in instant alarm, and she put a\\r\\ndetaining hand upon his wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t!\" she quavered.  \"Don\\'t go away!  I--I don\\'t want to be left\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax laughed outright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haf you forgot our minister?\" he demanded.  \"Ve don\\'t vant to go to\\r\\nhis house vithout first giffin\\' him a chanc\\'t to get some _clothes_\\r\\non.  Efen up your vay, the ministers vear a suit under their\\r\\nnighd-gowns vhen they marry people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled faintly at his labored wit, and, as her heart fluttered at\\r\\nthis definite approach to the end of her journey, permitted him to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he been absent for only the minute that he had promised, the time\\r\\nwould have seemed long to the waiting girl, but he remained invisible\\r\\nfor much longer, and to Mary, watching the laughing, uncaring\\r\\nstrangers from another life, the terror of the city in her soul and\\r\\nthe sense of all that she had done lurking in the shadows of her\\r\\nbrain, the quarter of an hour appeared to be four times that period.\\r\\nOnce she feared that he had met with some accident; once she was\\r\\nsaved from starting in search of him only by the knowledge that, in\\r\\nso doing, she must infallibly lose herself.  She would have made\\r\\ninquiries of a waiter, but the waiters were too imposing.  She would\\r\\nhave cried, but she was afraid to cry.  She would have ended,\\r\\nperhaps, by some utter betrayal of all that was battling within her;\\r\\nbut, just when she was sure, for the thousandth time, that she could\\r\\nendure no more, she saw Max coming toward her from the long-watched\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she noticed his strangely stern face, the old fear gave\\r\\nplace to a fresh one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s happened?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled back his chair spitefully and flung himself into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These crazy laws of your America,\" he snarled, \"there ain\\'t no sense\\r\\nin them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhy, it\\'s this way.  Of course, it don\\' make no difference; it only\\r\\nputs things off till _mor_nin\\'; but it\\'s this vay: I got my minister\\r\\nfriend on the \\'phone, un\\' he\\'s all ready to marry us, only he says\\r\\nthe law says ve must haf a license from City Hall first, un\\' if ve\\r\\ndon\\'t get von, he can go to chail because of marryin\\' us vith_out_\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mary, \"let\\'s get a license.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax spread forward the palms of his dark hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can ve?\" he demanded.  \"The City Hall closes in the afternoon\\r\\nun\\' don\\'t open till _mor_nin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, apparently, was tragedy.  Specific reasons for its tragic\\r\\nelements the girl would, perhaps, have found it hard to give, but\\r\\nthat it was tragic she knew instinctively.  Her blue eyes opened wide\\r\\nin fright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are we to do?\" she pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Max, the resourceful, had been, it appeared, only temporarily\\r\\ncheckmated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought of that,\" he said.  \"Ve can\\'t get married now till\\r\\nto-morrow; but my modder has a good friend un\\' I delephone _her_.\\r\\nShe told me she\\'d be glad to have you her guest ofer to-nighd.  I\\'ll\\r\\ntake you there in a taxi, un\\' go home for my own sleep.  I\\'d take you\\r\\nvith me, but it vouldn\\'t do to spring a new vife on the family\\r\\nvithout varnin\\'.  Then I\\'ll have talked vith my own people, und I\\'ll\\r\\nbring them around to the veddin\\', first thing in the mornin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, however, quailed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to do that,\" she inconsequently responded.  \"I don\\'t\\r\\nwant to go to strange people\\'s alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t you vorry, now,\" Max soothed her.  \"I\\'ll go vith you for a\\r\\nliddle vhile un\\' see that you make yourself at home.  This friend of\\r\\nmy modder\\'s is a fine voman, un\\' she\\'s _rich_.  She is Mrs. Légère.\\r\\nShe lives in a fine house: you\\'ll like her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe persisted in his persuasions, and, in the end, he won her\\r\\nacquiescence.  After all, here were the walls of the city about her,\\r\\nand she had no choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they had been talking, the waiter had returned and had placed\\r\\nbefore each of them one of the stemmed glasses full of the pale\\r\\nyellow concoction that Max had ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell,\" grinned the host, \"here\\'s happy returns of the day un\\' many\\r\\n_of_ them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took his glass in his hairy hand and flung the contents down his\\r\\nthroat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary looked at the drink in growing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t it whiskey?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-o-o!  I don\\'t drink vhiskey.  This is only vermout\\' un\\' tchin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gin\\'s just the same as whiskey,\" the girl protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not by a long sighd it ain\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s liquor, anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure, it\\'s liquor; but drink a liddle of it; it vill gif you an\\r\\nappetite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shook her russet head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t need no appetite,\" she said; \"I\\'m half starved as it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll need something to grind up these here Hungarian things,\\r\\nthough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Mary; \"I\\'d rather not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But efferybody does here in New York.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I guess I\\'ll wait till I\\'m a regular New Yorker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t your fader drink?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes he does,\" said the girl, conclusively; \"an\\' that\\'s why I\\r\\ndon\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe urged her no further; he even denied himself a glass of the wine\\r\\nthat he had ordered, and he succeeded, by this abstinence, in\\r\\nregaining whatever he had lost of her faith in him.  He ate heartily\\r\\nhimself, and if his manner of eating was not precisely that most\\r\\ncommon in restaurants of a more careful sort, this was something that\\r\\nthe girl would have failed to note even had she not been so busily\\r\\nengaged by wonder at the service and consumption of the novel food.\\r\\nIt was not until, contentedly sighing, she had sunk back from the\\r\\nwreck of her second ice, that she remembered again the lateness of\\r\\nthe hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a display of his large bills and another flurry of attendants,\\r\\nthey left the restaurant, walking among the gayly dressed and loudly\\r\\nlaughing people at the tables, passing down the heavily carpeted\\r\\nstairs, and entering another pulsing motor-car.  Max leaned out of\\r\\nthe door and gave an address that Mary did not hear; the chauffeur\\r\\nthrew forward the metal clutch, and the automobile shot ahead on its\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went for some time under the still hammering elevated; then\\r\\nturned through a quieter and darker street; threaded rapidly,\\r\\ntwisting hither and yon, a dozen other highways and byways and at\\r\\nlength drew up at their destination.  Max leaped lightly to the\\r\\npavement and tossed the driver a bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neffer mind the change,\" he said, and had scarcely helped Mary to\\r\\ndismount before the car had snorted away into the night, leaving the\\r\\npair of young lovers in the scarcely broken darkness and in a silence\\r\\nthat seemed surrounded by a dim, distant rumble of city-sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl could see little of her whereabouts.  She observed only that\\r\\nshe was in a slumbering block of blinded dwelling-houses, a scene\\r\\ndifferent from any that New York had thus far presented to her.  One\\r\\ndistant, sputtering arc-light succeeded only in accentuating the\\r\\ngloom; underfoot the way resounded to the slightest tread; from the\\r\\nlittle patch of inky sky into which the roofs blended above, a bare\\r\\nhandful of anæmic stars twinkled drowsily, and, on both sides, from\\r\\ncorner to corner, the uniform, narrow houses rose in somber\\r\\nrepetition, each with its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each with\\r\\nits blank windows, each seemingly asleep behind its mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than this, indeed, Mary\\'s tired eyes could have had no time to\\r\\nobserve, for Max\\'s strong fingers were at once curled under her\\r\\narmpit, and she was hurried up to one of the innumerable mute\\r\\ndoorways.  He pressed a button hidden somewhere in the wall, and,\\r\\nalmost immediately, the door swung open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair looked from darkness upon a rosy twilight.  Under the feeble\\r\\nrays of the pink-shadowed stairway, there were just visible the\\r\\noutlines of a full-blown form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello, Rosie!\" cried Max as, quickly snapping the door behind him,\\r\\nhe passed by his charge and seized an invisible hand.  \"You vaited up\\r\\nfor us un\\' come to the door yourself!  That vas good of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her Gallic cognomen, Mrs. Rose Légère replied in the tone\\r\\nand vernacular of Manhattan Island.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I waited for you,\" she answered.  \"But don\\'t talk so loud:\\r\\nyou\\'ll wake the whole family.--And is this the little lady, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf disposed to resist, Mary felt herself gently propelled forward\\r\\nby Max, and then enveloped in an ample, strangely perfumed embrace,\\r\\nwhile two full warm lips printed a kiss upon her cool young cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come into the back parlor,\" said Rose Légère, lightly seizing the\\r\\ngirl\\'s hand.  \"I want to get a look at the bride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe led the way past the closed double doors of the front room on the\\r\\nground floor, and into a rear apartment that, though not brilliantly\\r\\nilluminated, was far better lighted than the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a room the like of which Mary had never seen, decorated in\\r\\ncolors that outshone the rainbow and filled to overflowing with\\r\\nfurniture that, to the undiscriminating eyes of the girl, gave it the\\r\\nair of a chamber in the Cave of Monte Cristo.  Gilt-framed pictures\\r\\nof beautiful men and women--she supposed they must be Grecian men and\\r\\nwomen--flamed, in more than lifelike hues, from the crimson walls.\\r\\nThe tall lamp on the blue-clothed table was shaded in red; the thick\\r\\nrug flowered gorgeously; the deep chairs were upholstered in pale\\r\\nbrown, and the lazy sofa on which, as Max closed the inner door upon\\r\\ntheir entrance, Mrs. Légère seated herself with her guest, was\\r\\nstuffed with soft pillows of bewildering radiance.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, when Mary came to look at her, did the hostess seem out of\\r\\nkeeping with her surroundings.  To the girl\\'s home Owen Denbigh had\\r\\nonce brought a large, lithographed calendar, issued by a brewery, and\\r\\ndepicting, at its top, a woman of the elder Teutonic days, very red\\r\\nand white, with long yellow hair, and a body of rounded proportions,\\r\\nwhich threatened to grind to powder the rock on which she sat, and\\r\\ndesperately endangered the filmy garments that enfolded without\\r\\nclothing her.  It was of this picture that Mary instantly thought\\r\\nwhen she got her first full view of Mrs. Légère.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hostess was clad in a long, fluttering, baby-blue kimona, spotted\\r\\nby embroidered white dragons, with sleeves that fell despairingly\\r\\nfrom her puckered elbows, disclosing thick white arms with rolls of\\r\\nfat at the wrists, and plump hands and fingers the almond shaped\\r\\nnails of which gleamed like the points of daggers.  The folds of\\r\\nlight silk, held by a large amethyst pin at the base of her sturdy\\r\\nthroat, bulged broadly over her capacious breasts and trailed, across\\r\\nfrou-frouing lace, far beyond her heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this Mary saw first, and then, looking upward across the figure\\r\\nthat, literally, overshadowed her, she saw a large, round,\\r\\ngood-enough-natured face, surmounting a white double chin.  The\\r\\ncorn-colored hair was massed in an intricate maze of puffs and coils\\r\\nand braids, which made the girl wonder how much was its owner\\'s\\r\\nnatural growth and how much was due to the artifices that Mary had\\r\\nalways longed for and had always been denied.  The forehead was low\\r\\nand calm; the violet eyes of a more than natural brightness, with\\r\\ncrowsfeet beside them and pouches below, only just discernible in\\r\\nlamplight.  The brows and lashes were of a blackness that contrasted\\r\\nwith the coiffure; the skin, here like snow and there as red as\\r\\nroses, and the full, easy-going mouth as crimson as a wound.  Mary\\r\\nthought that here at last was a beautiful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sure am glad to see you,\" purred Mrs. Légère, as, having divested\\r\\nthe guest of hat and coat, she whisked these into the hall and,\\r\\nreturning, again seated herself and fondled the visitor\\'s passive,\\r\\nbut flattered, hand between her own extensive, well-cared-for palms.\\r\\n\"Max raved about you over the telephone--just raved--and, now that I\\r\\nget to a clinch with you, I begin to think that he knew what he was\\r\\ntalking about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax was seating himself on an orange-colored ottoman opposite them.\\r\\nHe grinned broadly, his narrowed lips showing his even, sparkling\\r\\nteeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I knew vhat I vas talkin\\' about,\" he declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was not used to compliments, but she was too honest not to show\\r\\nthat she liked them.  She blushed, and was all the prettier for it;\\r\\nbut she did manage to deprecate the sentiments of the better known of\\r\\nher critics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Grossman is crazy,\" she modestly observed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About you he is,\" said Mrs. Légère; \"and,\" she added, \"I doo\\'t blame\\r\\nhim.--But look here\"--she placed a crooked forefinger under the\\r\\ngirl\\'s chin and turned the blushing face upward--\"look here, what a\\r\\ntired little woman it is!--Max, you\\'re so careless, I\\'ll bet you\\'ve\\r\\nnever thought to give this poor child a drop of wine to strengthen\\r\\nher after all that traveling!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tried to get her to,\" said Max, \"but she vouldn\\'t take it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t drink,\" explained Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you don\\'t, but,\" Mrs. Légère elucidated, \"taking a glass\\r\\nor two of wine after a railroad ride isn\\'t drinking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-o,\" Mary granted; \"but I don\\'t care for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not--only taken this way it\\'s medicine.  I don\\'t blame you\\r\\nfor not drinking in a restaurant with a bad boy like Max; but you\\r\\nneed it now; you\\'re all played out.  This is as good as your home\\r\\ntill to-morrow, you know.  Just have a little with me; I\\'m old enough\\r\\nto be your mother, and we won\\'t give Max a drop--just to punish\\r\\nhim.--Cassie!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had run through the speech with a rapidity that had left the girl\\r\\nno chance for reply, and now, before Mary could move her lips, she\\r\\nhad, with amazing agility, leaped to a back door, opened it, called\\r\\nan order into the darkness beyond, and as quickly returned to her\\r\\nformer position on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be the best thing in the world for you,\" she said.  \"The\\r\\ndoctor orders it for me, and so I always have it ready on ice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she concluded speaking, the door through which she had called was\\r\\nreopened and there entered a tall, raw-boned, glum, colored girl,\\r\\nwhose shining ebony skin was darkened by the white apron that she\\r\\nwore.  She bore a tray on which was a gilt-topped bottle and two\\r\\nnarrow glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put it there, Cassie,\" said Mrs. Légère, pointing to the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl obeyed and left the room.  Max seized the bottle, ripped off\\r\\nthe gilding and, wrapping his purple-bordered handkerchief about the\\r\\nneck, with one dexterous twist, drew out the resounding cork.\\r\\n\\r\\nA living foam gushed from the neck as the self-appointed butler\\r\\npoured into the two glasses a pale gold fluid, which creamed angrily\\r\\nto their edges, and then subsided until first one addition and then\\r\\nanother set them boiling again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Légère took a glass in each hand and pressed the foremost into\\r\\nthe passive palm of the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said she, in a phrase new to Mary, \"here we are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary hesitated, the glass to her lips.  She could hear the liquid\\r\\nwhispering to her, and particles seemed to jump from it and sting her\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vine,\" said Max.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what kind of wine?\" she weakly delayed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" her entertainer informed her, \"there is only one kind of\\r\\nwine in New York.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s tchampagne,\" hissed Max, as if the name were something too\\r\\nsacred to be spoken in the tone of ordinary conversation.  \"Un\\' this\\r\\nkind costs eighd dollars a bottle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words and the connotation had their lure.  Champagne--she had\\r\\nheard of it as the beverage of the rich; and eight dollars for one\\r\\nbottle--the price of two winter dresses!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on,\" smiled Mrs. Légère.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl still hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s to the wedding!\" prompted the hostess, and drank the entire\\r\\ncontents of her glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took a mouthful and swallowed it.  At first she nearly choked.\\r\\nThen the fiery liquid brought fresh tears to her blue eyes, still\\r\\nsmarting from the gas that had, a moment before, assailed them.  But\\r\\nfinally, there began to spread through her weary body a grateful\\r\\nglow, and, half in apology for what she feared had been a clownish\\r\\nexhibition, she looked up with red lips pleasantly parted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, wasn\\'t I right?\" inquired Mrs. Légère.  \"Don\\'t you feel better\\r\\nalready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I believe I do, thank you,\" Mary admitted.  \"Anyhow, it is pretty\\r\\ngood, I guess--when you get used to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took, bravely and with an ease now gained by experience, a second\\r\\ndrink, and, as she held the glass before her, Max gallantly\\r\\nreplenished it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bell rang and the glum, ebony maid passed through the room, closing\\r\\nboth doors behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, alarmed at this nocturnal interruption, started a little, but\\r\\nneither of her companions seemed to regard the incident as unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look much better,\" Mrs. Légère asseverated.  \"Finish that glass,\\r\\ndearie, and you\\'ll be all to the good again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think I\\'d better take so much?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Max and Mrs. Légère laughed unaffectedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhy, there ain\\'t enough here to hurt a baby,\" declared the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary accepted the assurance.  She did not like the taste of the\\r\\nchampagne, but she knew now that she had been very tired, and the\\r\\nwine sent fresh life and energy through her sleepy limbs.  She\\r\\nemptied the glass and felt, joyfully, all her fears and regrets\\r\\nslipping for her.  Doubt and difficulty were resolved into a\\r\\nshimmering mist, were overcome, were forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black maid thrust her head in at the hall-doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Légère rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" she said, leaving the room.  \"I\\'ll be right back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax, the instant she was gone, rose in his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to fool her,\" he said.  \"I\\'m going to graft her drink!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the glass that his hostess had placed upon the table, poured\\r\\nmore of the wine into it, replenished the glass of his now\\r\\nunresisting companion and sat down by her side, his arm stretched\\r\\nbehind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, with refreshed courage, broke the silence.  She was feeling\\r\\nlike a naughty child triumphantly successful in her naughtiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, Max,\" she said, \"I gave a jump when that bell rang?  I\\r\\nthought for a minute they might be after us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nix on that,\" chuckled Max.  \"They couldn\\'t catch us if they tried.\\r\\nHere\\'s to the runavays!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey clinked glasses and drank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess,\" the young man pursued, \"it was chust von of Rosie\\'s\\r\\nboarders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her boarders?  Does she run a boarding-house?\"  There was a note of\\r\\ndignified scorn in Mary\\'s climbing voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure she keeps boarders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I----\"  Mary hesitated.  She was tasting wine for the first time\\r\\nin her life, she had been tired and nerve-wracked, and now, though\\r\\nthoughts danced through her mind with unfamiliar rapidity, utterance\\r\\nseemed to her suddenly, and somewhat amusingly, to have become too\\r\\nclumsy to keep pace with them.  \"I thought,\" she elaborately\\r\\npersisted, \"that--you--said--she--was rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is,\" said Max; \"only she\\'s got a big house she can\\'t all use\\r\\nherself.  Lots of people fill their houses that vay in N\\'York.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary started to formulate a reply that came glistening along the dim\\r\\nhorizon of her mind; but just then there was a light tap at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in!\" called Max, and Mrs. Légère re-entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precaution of her hostess forced a smile from Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you knock?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Légère shook her corn-colored locks wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t ever disturb lovers,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down opposite the pair she was addressing and, without\\r\\nnoticing that Max had appropriated her glass, discovered a fresh one\\r\\non the mantelpiece, poured herself a mouthful of the wine and then\\r\\ndecanted the rest for Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had just put down the empty bottle when the bell rang a second\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord,\" she sighed, \"there it goes again!  These people will be\\r\\nthe death of me, losing their keys and coming in at all hours.  Never\\r\\nmind, Cassie,\" she called through the rear door, \"I\\'ll go myself!\"\\r\\nAnd then, to Mary, she concluded: \"I\\'ll attend to this and then I\\'ll\\r\\ncome right back and send Max home and show you to your room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left them seated on the sofa, Max\\'s dark hand encircling the\\r\\nsoft, young fingers of the girl as gently as if he had been a rustic\\r\\nwooer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I go graft another bottle from the _kit_chen?\" he asked,\\r\\ngrinning impishly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shook her russet head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for me,\" she said; \"I guess I\\'ve had enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax again refrained from insistence.  Instead, he remained beside\\r\\nher, and fell once more into the story that she had learned best to\\r\\nlike,--the beautiful pictures of the wonderful city, of the work-free\\r\\nlife that she should lead there, and of their marriage on the fast\\r\\napproaching morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually, as his voice ran smoothly on, the words he was then saying\\r\\nbecame confused in her brain with other words that he had said\\r\\nearlier in the evening.  Her eyelids grew heavy.  The mood of\\r\\nexhilaration passed, and a weariness far more compelling than that\\r\\nfrom which she had previously suffered stole upon her.  Mrs. Légère\\r\\nwas absent for an unconscionable time.  The girl yawned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder when she\\'s comin\\' back,\" said Mary, \"I\\'m--I\\'m awful tired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax\\'s hand slipped to her unresisting head and pressed it down upon\\r\\nhis shoulder.  He had not yet so much as kissed her, and he did not\\r\\nkiss her now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t vorry about her,\" he said softly.  \"You\\'re tired out.  Chust\\r\\nclose your eyes for a minute, Mary, un\\' I\\'ll vake you vhen she comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis shoulder was very comfortable.  She closed her blue eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will wake me?\" she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I vill,\" said Max.  \"I\\'ll have you clean avake before she\\'s\\r\\nthrough knockin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he must have forgotten that promise, for when Mrs. Légère at last\\r\\nreturned, he was still sitting there among the pillows, Mary\\'s hair\\r\\nfallen over his green coat, her cheeks pinker than ever, and her\\r\\ngirlish breast rising and falling rhythmically in sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nAWAKENING\\r\\n\\r\\nClinging to a gigantic pendulum, Mary was swept through a mighty\\r\\ncurve of roaring darkness, up from the black chasm of insensibility,\\r\\nand tossed, swaying over that frightful cliff, to the precipitous\\r\\ncrag of consciousness.  For what seemed many minutes, she tottered on\\r\\nthe verge, dizzy, afraid.  Then white knives, swift and sharp,\\r\\nslashed at her eyes and forced up the lids.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefying closed blinds and drawn chintz curtains, the sunlight of\\r\\nnoonday beat upon her face.  She pulled something between her cheek\\r\\nand the leaping rays.  Her hand trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first she could neither think nor recollect.  The blows of an ax,\\r\\nregular, tremendous, were splitting her head.  Her throat was hot and\\r\\ndry and choking.  Her stomach crawled and leaped with nausea.  From\\r\\nhead to foot she was shaking with recurrent nervous chills that\\r\\nwracked a body of which every muscle was strained and sore.\\r\\n\\r\\nRealization of the present came slowly, but it preceded all memory of\\r\\nthe past.  She found that the thing with which she had instinctively\\r\\nshaded her eyes was a sheet, and, as she lowered it, she saw, in a\\r\\nglance where the employment of sight was a separate pain, that she\\r\\nwas lying among large pillows in a big brass bed, heavily mattressed.\\r\\nBeyond the foot of the bed her survey could not extend, because the\\r\\nfoot was high and hung with a pink and green down quilt; but between\\r\\ntwo windows against the wall to her right, she saw a bureau, bearing\\r\\na few scant toilet articles, and opposite, on the left, there was a\\r\\nwashstand with a basin on the floor before it and, on its top, a\\r\\npitcher, a soap-tray, a small brown bottle, and a little blue box\\r\\nbursting with white cotton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not the room in which she had first fallen asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that isolated fact flashing like a message of disaster through\\r\\nher brain, she sat suddenly upright in the bed; but the room pitched\\r\\nbefore her like a boat in the trough of a storm on the river at home.\\r\\nA wave of sickness hissed over her, and she sank back among pillows\\r\\nrepellantly scented.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaguely she realized that she must be in a room somewhere above the\\r\\nground floor.  Dimly she began to wonder how she had got up the\\r\\nstairs.  What would the kindly Mrs. Légère think of her condition?\\r\\nAnd that which had happened--had it lasted for an hour or a night?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat which had happened--there memory, in a blinding blast,\\r\\nreasserted itself.  What had been but half-wittingly accepted was now\\r\\nwholly known.  Hot irons were branding upon her brain the full\\r\\nhistory of all that had occurred: the deeds for which she had at last\\r\\nlearned the name, and the deeds that, even in her own frightened\\r\\nsoul, were nameless.  There was nothing--nothing of her, hand and\\r\\nfoot, and mouth and eye and soul--that was not defiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor herself, for Max, but most of all for the hideous facts of life,\\r\\nshe shook in physical disgust.  Before the face of such things, what\\r\\nmust birth and marriage mean?  She opened her eyes, but she could not\\r\\nlook at her silent witnesses; she shut her lids, but she saw, behind\\r\\nthem, the hairy arms of a gorilla closing on her, to break her and\\r\\nbear her away.  For one moment, all that she had loved she hated, and\\r\\nfor the next, seizing his smiling reassurance as the one vow that\\r\\ncould legalize what nothing could refine, all that she had come to\\r\\nhate she tried to force herself to love.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe understood now so much that she had never understood before: the\\r\\nwhispered words of town gossip, the stray glimpses of lovers in the\\r\\nsummer lanes, the cautions and the commands that had once so galled\\r\\nher in her home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the word, her mind swung back to far-away yesterday.  She was\\r\\nsorry that she had been the cause--for she had been the cause--of the\\r\\nspilling of the stew.  She was sorry that she had been so sharp with\\r\\nSallie.  She wished that she had washed the dishes less unwillingly.\\r\\nShe still feared--she more than ever feared--the swaying bulk of\\r\\nmasculinity that had been her father, but she began to see in him the\\r\\nlogical result of forces that were themselves, as yet, beyond her\\r\\nken; and she looked with a new and pitying vision upon the picture of\\r\\nher little, work-worn and care-marked mother stooping over the\\r\\npolished kitchen-stove.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer breast tossed and her throat throbbed; but she was beyond tears.\\r\\nPainfully, slowly, yet with resolution, she struggled back to her\\r\\nsitting-posture in the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this position she found herself facing a long mirror hung against\\r\\nthe opposite wall, and in the mirror she saw what was herself.  With\\r\\na low cry, she pulled loose the sheet and covered her nakedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat done, she looked again at the strange face that fronted her: a\\r\\nface the more strange because it was the intimate become alien, a\\r\\nruin, an accusation.  Framed in a tangle of dank hair, the cheeks,\\r\\nonce pink, were chalky now, and splotched with red, the mouth that\\r\\nshe had known only as full and firm, was loose and twisted; the eyes\\r\\nthat had been blue, now circled with black, burned in blood-shot\\r\\nfields like coals of angry fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne impulse alone directed her: to find her clothes; to put them on;\\r\\nto return, as far as the mask of appearances would take her, to the\\r\\nself that she had been.  In spite of aching head and quivering hands,\\r\\nshe wrapped the sheet about her and, with infinite care, got from the\\r\\nbed.  The floor seemed to sweep up to meet her, but she steadied\\r\\nherself against the wall and, each timid stride a separate agony,\\r\\nbegan to stumble about the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked for a clothes-closet or wardrobe, but there was neither.\\r\\nThe only door was the door of exit, and the nearest chair was empty.\\r\\nIn a corner she saw a pile of linen: laboriously she stooped and\\r\\npicked it up, unrolled a portion, and then, gasping in horror, tossed\\r\\nit away.  On the other chair there lay a long kimona of crimson.  She\\r\\nlifted it and found, neatly arranged below, a sheer cambric garment\\r\\nedged with coarse lace, two black silk stockings slashed with red,\\r\\nand a pair of slippers, high-heeled, with buckles of brass--for no\\r\\nreason that she could have formulated, the sight sickened her.  She\\r\\nwent to the bureau and tugged at its drawers, but all that she found\\r\\nwas a single brown bottle, like that she had first observed on the\\r\\nwashstand, filled with white tablets and labeled \"Poison.\"\\r\\nObviously, her clothes had been taken from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a panic of shame, she groped blindly for the door: she must call\\r\\nfor Mrs. Légère.  She grasped the knob and turned it--the door was\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nFear, mad and unreasoning, drove its spurs into her sides.\\r\\nForgetting her nausea, heedless of her pain, she ran first to one\\r\\nwindow and then to the other, but the bowed shutters, though they\\r\\nadmitted the light, would open for nothing beside: they were fastened\\r\\nwith riveted loops of brass, and, looking through the small space\\r\\nbetween them, she could catch only a glimpse of the street far below.\\r\\nShe tried to argue that the key might have fallen from the lock\\r\\nwithin the room, but she could not find it, and, the sheet dropping\\r\\nfrom her shoulders, she began to rattle at the knob, and then to\\r\\npound upon the panels, her voice rising swiftly from a low call to a\\r\\nhigh, hysterical, frantic cry for help.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!\" she cried, and then as\\r\\nsuddenly ceased, tilted against the door, and collapsed into a naked\\r\\nheap upon the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll power of movement seemed to have slipped from her, but when there\\r\\ncame a heavy footfall on the stair, a swish of skirts outside and the\\r\\nloud rasping of a key inserted in the lock, Mary leaped galvanically\\r\\nto her feet, gathered the sheet about her body, and flung herself\\r\\nupon the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened and closed behind Rose Légère, who promptly relocked\\r\\nit and slipped the key into the swelling bosom but half concealed by\\r\\nher dragon-spotted, baby-blue negligé.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What in hell\\'s the matter with _you_?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little more rotund of figure, a little looser in the cheeks, and\\r\\nmore patently crayoned and powdered about the eyes, a little more\\r\\nobviously painted and a little older, she was still the woman of the\\r\\nbrewery\\'s advertisement.  But her forehead was knotted in deep, angry\\r\\nwrinkles; her under jaw was thrust so far forward that the roll of\\r\\nfat beneath it was invisible, and her eyes snapped with malice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shrank back among the pillows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Weren\\'t you yellin\\'?\" persisted Rose.  \"Did you lose your voice\\r\\ndoin\\' it?  What in the hell\\'s the matter with you, I say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a sweep of her stout arm, she seized the girl\\'s bare shoulder\\r\\nand shook it till Mary\\'s teeth clicked like castanets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not goin\\' to have any such racket in my house!\" the woman\\r\\nasseverated, as she plied her punishment.  \"You\\'ve got to learn\\r\\nfirst-off to keep your mouth to yourself, and be dead sure if you\\r\\ndon\\'t I\\'ll give you a real beatin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tossed Mary from her, as if her victim had been a bundle of\\r\\nstraw, and stood up again, arms akimbo, breathing scarcely beyond her\\r\\nnormal speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was half mad and wholly sick with dread.  She wanted to cry out\\r\\nfor rescue and dared not.  She wanted to rise and try to force the\\r\\ndoor or break open the shutters, but she could not move.  She could\\r\\nonly lie there panting for breath, with her mouth gasping and her\\r\\nheart hammering at her breast.  She had closed her eyes.  She opened\\r\\nthem just in time to see Rose, whose slippered foot had touched\\r\\nsomething on the floor, stoop, pick up, and place beside the key in\\r\\nher bosom, a crumpled purple-bordered handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then,\" said the woman in a tone that, if still hard, was at\\r\\nleast less intense than its predecessor, \"try to tell me what\\'s the\\r\\ntrouble, like somebody this side of Matteawan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a supreme lunge at courage, Mary got her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want my clothes,\" she said dully.  \"And where\\'s Max?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your clothes ain\\'t fit to wear,\" said Rose; \"an\\' I don\\'t know where\\r\\nMax is.  What you need is breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want my clothes,\" monotonously repeated Mary.  \"I couldn\\'t eat to\\r\\nsave my life.  Hasn\\'t Max come back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Rose did not seem to hear the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense, honey,\" she said, her anger seeming now entirely passed.\\r\\n\"Of course you must eat.  I got up on purpose for it, and I\\'ve set\\r\\nthat nigger cooking a perfect peach of a breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want my clothes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose leaned over the bed and put a soothing hand upon her\\r\\nquestioner\\'s fevered forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now don\\'t lose your nerve, dearie,\" she advised.  \"I\\'m your\\r\\nfriend--honest, I am.  You rest awhile and eat a little, and then\\r\\nmaybe we\\'ll talk things over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hasn\\'t come yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, he hasn\\'t.  But why are you lettin\\' that jar you?  Perhaps he\\'s\\r\\nsick, too.  Perhaps he\\'s had some kind of a scrap with his old man.\\r\\nHow do I know what\\'s hit him?  He\\'ll show up all right in the end\\r\\nand, till he does show up, you just make yourself at home here and\\r\\ndon\\'t bother.  I\\'ll take care of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in the woman\\'s solicitude--or it may have been the quick\\r\\nand unexplained change from violence to tenderness--frightened Mary\\r\\neven more than the initial outburst had frightened her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to go home,\" she quavered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure you want to go home,\" Rose acquiesced, without moving a muscle.\\r\\n\"But how can you go?  Max told me you\\'d sent your people a note\\r\\nsaying you\\'d hiked out with him to be married, and how can you go\\r\\nhome until he gets back here and you can take him along and show the\\r\\ngoods?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer tone was lightly argumentative, but it was also stolidly\\r\\nmerciless, and it hurled true to its mark the shaft of conviction.\\r\\nOut of the yesterday, Mary heard the voice of her father that was the\\r\\nvoice of a society rigidly shaped by the conditions of its own\\r\\nfashioning:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bay \\'un thirty year old an\\' noot another sin ag\\'in \\'un, I would beat\\r\\n\\'un within a bare inch o\\' \\'er deeth, an\\' turn \\'un oot to live the\\r\\nlife \\'un had picked fur herself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe understood that statement now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can go to Max\\'s,\" she hazarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To--_where_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Max\\'s father\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe you can; but it\\'s a long trip to Hungary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary answered nothing.  Rose had only confirmed what the girl had for\\r\\nan hour feared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see how it is,\" pursued Rose, reading Mary\\'s silence with a\\r\\npracticed mind.  \"Better let me take care of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s face was hidden.  Again she felt New York as a malevolent\\r\\nconsciousness, a living prison implacably raising around her its\\r\\ninsurmountable walls.  There was, she thought, nothing left her but\\r\\nthe diminishing hope of Max\\'s return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you will eat, won\\'t you?\" Rose was continuing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose patted quietly one of the clenched hands that lay close to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better do it, dearie,\" she said.  \"I\\'m your friend; remember that.\\r\\nYou can have whatever you want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary mastered what strength remained to her.  She raised herself on\\r\\nher elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let me go!\" she pleaded, extending an open palm like a beggar\\r\\nasking for a crust.  \"I don\\'t care if my clothes is mussed.  I don\\'t\\r\\ncare what\\'ll happen afterward.  Just let me go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a fool,\" Rose made cool rejoinder.  \"Where\\'d you go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'d become of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you would care, all right, all right.  You can\\'t go home, and\\r\\nyou\\'ve no clothes and no money and no references.  You couldn\\'t get\\r\\nwork anywhere in New York, and you couldn\\'t get away from New York.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I----\"  Mary groped through the darkness of her soul.  \"I can do\\r\\nhousework.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not without a reference you can\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could go to some office----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you went to any charity-joint, they\\'d throw you out because of\\r\\nwhat\\'s happened to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could beg on the street if I had to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think the men in this town give money for nothing to a\\r\\ngood-looking girl?  You could go on the street, that\\'s what you could\\r\\ndo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase was new to its hearer, but the tone explained it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" she stumbled forward, \"I could go to the police.  They\\'d help\\r\\nme.  I could----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at that word Rose flew into a torrent of anger and abuse that\\r\\ndwarfed the former tempest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could, could you?\" she cried.  \"That\\'s your game, is it, you\\r\\nsneaking little innocent?  I\\'ll bet you\\'re a damn sight wiser than\\r\\nyou let on.  But you don\\'t know this town: you can take that much\\r\\nfrom me.  Go to the police!  Go to \\'em!  The cops on this beat are my\\r\\nfriends: if you don\\'t believe it, I\\'ll bring \\'em in and introduce\\r\\nyou.  They\\'re my friends, and so\\'s the whole precinct my friends.  Go\\r\\nto \\'em!  Go to \\'em, and I\\'ll have you pinched and locked up for bein\\'\\r\\nwhat you are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had drawn away from the blast, but Rose\\'s powerful fist caught\\r\\nher under the chin and sent her crashing down on the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t come that on me!\" the jailer continued.  \"You\\'ve got your\\r\\nchoice: you can stay here and live easy, or walk out and go to jail,\\r\\nand that\\'s all you can do.  Max ain\\'t comin\\' back, and you always\\r\\nknew he wouldn\\'t come back.  You know what this house is as well as I\\r\\ndo, and you\\'ve got to stay here and earn your keep.  If you give one\\r\\nyip I\\'ll have the cops in!  You don\\'t want to eat, hey?  Well then,\\r\\nyou shan\\'t eat!  You can lay there and starve, or you can knock on\\r\\nthe door and get the best breakfast you ever had, all ready for you.\\r\\nDo what you please; but if you let out one yip I\\'ll hammer the life\\r\\nout of you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned and left the room.  She banged the door behind her, and\\r\\nMary, in a swirling dream, heard herself again locked in her cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BIRDS OF PREY\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough all the days that immediately followed--the days that were\\r\\nnights, and the nights that were red noondays--a thousand horrors,\\r\\nfrom subtle word to recurring experience, conjoined to assure to Mary\\r\\nthe reality of her servitude.  All of that first day, after Rose had\\r\\nleft her with the dark blood oozing from her cut chin upon the\\r\\nscented pillows, she lay, like a wounded dog, now in a faint and then\\r\\nin a stupor, on the disordered bed.  As the sunlight shifted and the\\r\\nshadows lengthened in the room, torpor gave way to reawakened fear,\\r\\nand she crawled into a corner and tried to hide herself, trembling,\\r\\nwith chattering teeth, at every sound of laughter that rose from the\\r\\nlower floors, at every footstep upon the stair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrice Rose returned.  Each time she bore a steaming dish that, as\\r\\nthe girl\\'s physical pain grew less, assailed the nostrils with\\r\\nincreasing poignancy.  Each time Mary shook her stubborn russet head.\\r\\nAnd each time the visit ended in a beating.\\r\\n\\r\\nEscape by door or window was out of the question; to attempt to raise\\r\\nan alarm was to invite fresh violence; and gradually grew the\\r\\ncertainty that the situation was genuinely as the jailer had\\r\\ndescribed it: that the street was worse than the house, and that Mary\\r\\nwas her own prisoner.  She found the bottle labeled \"Poison,\" and bit\\r\\none of the tablets, but she was young and afraid, and she spat the\\r\\nburning crumbs from her mouth.  She did not dare to die, and when\\r\\nRose came again to the room, her captive was too weak to refuse the\\r\\nbroth that was fed her, as if she were a sick child, from a spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a dear girl, after all,\" said the mistress, as she\\r\\nadministered the grateful food.  \"You do as I say and you won\\'t never\\r\\nbe sorry.  All I want is to have you sensible.  I\\'m your friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary said nothing: she was too weak to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now,\" Rose pursued, \"I\\'ll just give you a drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when she had come back, she had not come back alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst of prisons is that in which the door is so cunningly closed\\r\\nupon the inmate that, at last, after the brutality is familiar, the\\r\\ninmate seems originally to have closed it upon herself, and in such a\\r\\nfortress of pain Mary now found herself restrained.  The process was\\r\\nsimple.  It was merely first to wound and then to inure.  The descent\\r\\nto hell is not easy; it is red with blood and wet with tears; but\\r\\nhell itself must be endured.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not for some days that any woman save Rose came to Mary\\'s cell\\r\\nand then, one afternoon, two women followed the grating key.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were alike only as to clothes.  Both wore loose negligé\\r\\ngarments, but whereas the one was sturdy and German-blonde, with\\r\\nstraw-colored hair, round and heavy face, blue eyes and peasant\\r\\nframe--a younger Rose--the other was wiry, compact, her brows low and\\r\\ndark under somber hair, her full cheeks red only in defiance of a\\r\\nswarthy skin, her eyes black and her mouth vermillion.  It was this\\r\\none who, with an accent that a more sophisticated ear than Mary\\'s\\r\\nwould have placed along the Seine, was the first to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ello!\" she laughed, her teeth gleaming between her lips like\\r\\npomegranate seeds.  \"We have come to make the call.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout awaiting a reply, she jumped upon the bed, drew her feet\\r\\nbeneath her, and produced and lit a cigarette.  The German girl moved\\r\\nmore slowly to the other side and there elaborately ensconced herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at her visitors without immediately replying.  She had\\r\\nnot, in fact, the remotest idea of what was the fitting word.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the French girl was unruffled by this silence.  She flung her\\r\\nhead back upon a white neck and sent a slow column of blue smoke\\r\\ncurling toward the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name,\" she explained, with an odd clipping of her speech, \"eet\\r\\nees Celeste, an\\' my good frien\\' here,\" she continued with an easy\\r\\ngesture of the cigarette, \"she ees Fritzie--chust a bar-bar-ous\\r\\nGerman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at her with a gaze large and listless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' you\\' name?\" pursued Celeste, \"eet ees--what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFritzie supplied the answer, speaking in a ponderous contralto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her name is Mary,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Bien_--a pretty name,\" Celeste rattled on, precisely as if her\\r\\nunwilling entertainer had made the response.  \"I like eet well;\\r\\nbut\"--and she studied with unobtrusive care the russet-framed,\\r\\nindignant face before her--\"eet ees not so good as ees yourself.  I\\r\\nt\\'ink--let me see--yaas: I t\\'ink I shall call you \\'Violet.\\'--Violet,\\r\\nwhy you don\\'t eat more een dees \\'ouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m hardly ever hungry,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not hongry?--Oh-h, but you mohst be hongry!  Anyone so young mohst\\r\\nwant to eat, and anyone so beautiful mohst eat so as not to loose the\\r\\nbeauty.--Ees eet not so, Fritzie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German girl smiled gently and nodded her blonde head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach, yes,\" she rumbled.  \"The liebchen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" insisted Mary.  \"I don\\'t care about nothing.  I have a headache\\r\\nall the time.  I have one now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCeleste jumped lightly to the floor: it was as if to uncoil her feet\\r\\nand to reach the door required but a single movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Un moment!_\" she laughed.  \"I shall feex the _mal de tête_\\r\\nimmediate!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no time for remonstrance; the door closed upon her\\r\\nconcluding word, and Mary was left there gazing into the stolid,\\r\\nsphinxlike face of the placidly smiling German.  It was not a bad\\r\\nface, and soon Mary realized that it was a contented one.\\r\\n\\r\\nFritzie was returning her look with an equal curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you vorried?\" she finally inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" lied Mary proudly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dought you looked like vorried,\" the German continued.  \"Bud you\\r\\nshould be nod.  Dis iss a goot place.  Dere are loads vorse blaces in\\r\\nNew York dan dis: I know \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, but Mary\\'s lips remained closed, her eyes fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You bed I know \\'um!\" Fritzie repeated.  \"Bud dis blace--vhy, ve haf\\r\\nde best meals, so goot nobody gould besser haf!  I like dis blace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA faint question shot into Mary\\'s face.  At once Fritzie answered it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dat\\'s righd.  Listen: I gome over here two year ago in de steerage.\\r\\nSome of de vomen, men meet dem--oh, most all de nod-family vons--un\\'\\r\\ntook dem to dese here intelligence office dat are only fakes, un\\'\\r\\nsold dem, vidout dere knowin\\' nussin\\' of it, fur ten un\\' fifteen\\r\\ndollar\\' each.  Bud I vas careful.  I get a real tshob.--Ach, himmel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waved a broad palm in disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Id vas bad enough in de steerage mit all de sailor-mens kissin\\' you\\r\\nto-day un\\' kickin\\' you to-morrow; bud dat tshob of mine, dat vas de\\r\\nreal limit!

Un\\' den till late at nighd I haf to help cook, un\\' vait on\\r\\ndable, un\\' vash dishes some more still.

Un\\' den, after\\r\\nsome more, I gome here, pretty soon, to Miss Rose\\'s.  No\"--she waved\\r\\nher thick hand toward the door through which Celeste had lately\\r\\npassed--\"I\\'m nod like dat Frenchie.

No, I\\'m glad I gome here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned back upon her elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, dis Celeste----\" she began, but the French girl, just then\\r\\nentering, came with an air that was a sufficient explanation of her\\r\\nnever complex temperament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Voilà!_\" she smiled, holding aloft a long glass filled by a dull\\r\\ngreen liquid.  \"Let the leetle girl tak some of thees wheech I meex\\r\\nfor her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore she had well realized what she was doing, Mary had accepted\\r\\nthe glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" she asked weakly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absinthe,\" replied Celeste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It smells like licorice,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, but no; eet ees not that.  You try thees, an\\' then you can eat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think I want to eat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poof!  That ees folly!  See, now, I meex thees myself--I myself have\\r\\n_frappé_ eet.  Ees eet what you call polite that you say \\'no\\' to me?\\r\\nSay, now: ees eet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInvoluntarily Mary smiled.  It was a rueful little smile, but it was\\r\\na smile of exhausted consent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It won\\'t hurt me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thees?  You do not know eet.  Eet ees the enemy of all the headache,\\r\\nof all the heartache, of all the bad nerve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Mary drained the glass, and when her visitors left her\\r\\nthey turned no key upon their exit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, slowly, through all those early days, and through the days that\\r\\nimmediately followed them, the spell of the situation worked.  There\\r\\nwas infamy, there was torture.  The unending procession of\\r\\nvisitors--clerks, drummers, car-conductors, teamsters, gamesters,\\r\\nthieves, brothers in the fraternity of lust, equals in the night of\\r\\nhorror, mostly drunken, nearly all unclean of body and everyone\\r\\nfilthy of mind--the green government note was their certificate of\\r\\nqualification, the money, however acquired, constituted their right\\r\\nto those counterfeits which the house of Rose Légère was maintained\\r\\nto sell.  For that note, themselves the chattels of conditions, they\\r\\nmight caress or beat; for that, they might take whatever their hearts\\r\\ndemanded.  Was the slave wounded?  Was she ill?  Was she heartbroken?\\r\\nShe must smile; she must be one woman to all men.  She must receive\\r\\nthe blows with laughter, the ribaldry, the insults and the curses as\\r\\nwit.  She must pass from this to that--and she must not care.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet Mary, who was Violet now, could do nothing but take as final\\r\\nthe conclusion that Rose had drawn for her.  To return home, even if\\r\\nshe had the money, would be impossible, because to do so would be to\\r\\ncourt her father\\'s anger and her mother\\'s shame, with no hope of\\r\\neither pardon or justification.  To go out into the cheerless street\\r\\nthat sent its growling echoes up to her curtained window would be,\\r\\nshe was assured, to deliver herself to arrest or starvation.  She was\\r\\nignorant and young.  With no knowledge of the laws and the charities\\r\\nof the monster town, she saw only that the former, in uniform, was a\\r\\nback-door friend of her keepers, and she was told that the latter\\r\\nnever helped before they first publicly burned upon their victims\\'\\r\\nbrows the thenceforth ineradicable brand of infamy.  Without there\\r\\nwas, at the least, hunger, drudgery and disgrace; at the most,\\r\\nstarvation, jail, death.  Within, where fresh wounds meant but\\r\\nlittle, there obtained, under only a velvet-pawed tyranny, a\\r\\ntolerable democracy of disrepute, an equality of degradation, where\\r\\nfood, at any rate, and shelter and raiment were certain, and where\\r\\nold scars and fresh bruises were hidden from the world: the price was\\r\\nno more than supine acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnything like financial independence was, of course, impossible: the\\r\\nslaves of Rose Légère were as much slaves as any mutilated black man\\r\\nof the Congo, or any toil-cramped white man in a factory.  Their\\r\\nwages were paid to the supervisor, their few belongings secretly\\r\\nsearched for gratuities, and though one-half of each payment was,\\r\\ntheoretically, the portion of the employé, rent and board and\\r\\n_lingerie_ demanded, and must needs secure, prices that left each\\r\\nwoman hopelessly in debt to the mistress of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her senses in revolt, the mind and body of the newly-christened\\r\\nViolet came, by insidious degrees, nevertheless to approach some\\r\\nlikeness to adaptability.  Her material wants never went unsupplied,\\r\\nand such intelligence as she possessed began to swing toward that\\r\\npoint of view to differ from which could bring nothing save serious\\r\\ndiscomfort.  To the hope of Max\\'s return she still, in her own heart,\\r\\nclung with that tenacity which only a woman can exert upon an\\r\\nacknowledged impossibility, but she felt even this hope shrink\\r\\nbetween her clutching fingers, and, doing her best to reason, she\\r\\nknew that, even should the miracle happen, Max had brought her and\\r\\nleft her here with the intent that she should fulfill her economic\\r\\ndestiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo dull to see deeply into causes, she could only accept the slowly\\r\\nnumbing hail of effects.  Until a few days since, she had been a\\r\\nchild, and, like most children, the individual at fault in every\\r\\npersonal catastrophe.  It was thus that she began by blaming herself\\r\\nfor all that had now befallen her; it was only at moments of growth\\r\\nthat she turned her anger first against her own parents, then against\\r\\nthe active agent and finally against his principal, and it would be\\r\\nbut after deeper vision and harder usage that she could see both\\r\\nherself and them, and the whole company that made them possible, as\\r\\nmere grist in the mill of a merciless machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet for a long time her one passion was the passion of release.\\r\\nWithout clothes and money and protection she could understand no\\r\\nescape; but for these means she at last found courage to appeal to\\r\\nthe one source from which she could conceive of their coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI\\r\\n\\r\\nAN ANGEL UNAWARES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man to whom she first spoke, in a stolen instant, descending the\\r\\ndarkened stair, was a small shopkeeper, fat and pliable, beyond the\\r\\nage of violence, and, as he had just told her, a husband and the\\r\\nfather of a girl of her own age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen,\" she said, with one trembling hand upon his shoulder, \"I\\r\\nwant you to do me a favor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything you say, Violet,\" he chuckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk so loud, then.  I--I want you to take me out of here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked at her, through the rosy twilight, in a flattered\\r\\nbewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like me as much as that, do you?\" he sparred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t understand.  Of course, I like you; but what I meant\\r\\nwas----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe interrupted her, his fat fingers complacently patting her cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s not me that don\\'t tumble to the facts,\" he said; \"it\\'s you.  I\\r\\ntold you I was a family man.  I couldn\\'t put you anywhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t mean that.  I mean----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again he cut in upon her labored explanation, his commercial mind\\r\\ntraveling along lines in which it had been forced all his life to\\r\\ntravel, and his pride entrenching itself behind the trivial rampart\\r\\nof his income.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You girls!\" he laughed, in palpable deception.  \"You all think I\\'ve\\r\\ngot a lot of money.  Why, there ain\\'t no use thinkin\\' you can bleed\\r\\nme.  I\\'m a business man, an\\' I do everything on a straight business\\r\\nbasis, but I wouldn\\'t rent a flat for the finest of you that ever\\r\\nwalked Fourteenth Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s answer was brief.  That she should have given her confidence\\r\\nto such a beast, that such a beast should continue to thrive in the\\r\\nworld that was closed to her, and that, her pitiable confidence once\\r\\ngiven, she should be so grossly misinterpreted--these things sent a\\r\\nred rage rushing to her now always incarnadined cheeks.  She gave the\\r\\nshopkeeper a push that nearly sent him rolling to the foot of the\\r\\nstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get away from me!\" she whispered hoarsely.  \"Get away!  I wouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave you for a gift!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stumbled and gripped the rose-colored lamp upon the\\r\\nnewel-post, which swayed, under his rocking weight, like a palm-tree\\r\\nin a storm.  He gasped for breath, got it, and, shaking his fist\\r\\nupward through the shadows, began to bellow forth a storm of oaths\\r\\nthat, for foulness, utterly outdid the ejaculations to which, from\\r\\nboth sexes, Violet was already becoming accustomed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You come down here,\" he courageously shouted, \"and I\\'ll give you the\\r\\nworst beating you ever had in your life!  Nice place, this is!  I\\'ll\\r\\nhave it pinched--you see if I don\\'t!  You can\\'t make an easy thing\\r\\nout o\\' me!  You\\'ve robbed me, anyhow.  You\\'ll get what\\'s comin\\' to\\r\\nyou!\"--And he ended with the single epithet to which those four walls\\r\\nwere unaccustomed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose ran out from the parlor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shut up, you!\" she commanded of the disturber, in a low tone that\\r\\nnevertheless compelled obedience.  \"What\\'s the trouble, Violet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet leaned against the stair-wall, half-way up, her burning hands\\r\\npressed to her burning face.  She was mad with anger and shame, but\\r\\nshe was also afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You heard him,\" she gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" snapped the visitor, his voice uncontrollably resuming its\\r\\nformer timbre, \"and you heard me, too!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mistress is, of necessity, always, in a crisis, against the slave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Rose, \"tell me what she done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, however, saw at once the necessity of changing the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says he\\'s been robbed!\" she called down the stairs.  And then she\\r\\nran after her words, and stood under the lamp, facing them both, her\\r\\narms extended, the flowing sleeves trembling with the emotion that\\r\\nthey covered but could not conceal.  \"Search me!\" she commanded.  \"If\\r\\nyou think I took a cent of yours, search me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a vision that brought conviction with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the sputtering visitor could correct the situation, Rose had,\\r\\nperhaps against her will, been converted.  She took the man\\'s hat\\r\\nfrom the hall-rack at her side, put it on his head, opened the\\r\\nstreet-door, and gently propelled him through it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re drunk,\" she said, \"an\\' you\\'d better get out before I call the\\r\\ncop.  There ain\\'t no badger business in this house, an\\' don\\'t you\\r\\nforget it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shut the door, and turned calmly to Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much did you get?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Miss Rose, you know----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean what did you touch him for?  You mustn\\'t play that sort of\\r\\ngame here: it gives the house a bad name.  But just this once we\\'ll\\r\\ndivide up an\\' not say anything more about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s eyes opened wide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t steal a penny,\" she declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose regarded her with a softening countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Word of honor?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Word of honor,\" vowed Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, but even if you do touch them, you mustn\\'t ever let them\\r\\n_think_ you do.  A man\\'ll forgive you for hurtin\\' him anywhere but in\\r\\nhis pocket-book.--You\\'re all worked up, dearie.  Come on out to the\\r\\nkitchen an\\' have a bottle of beer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were pouring the drinks, a heavy foot sounded in the outside\\r\\npassageway and a careful four knocks followed upon the rear door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s Larry,\" said Rose, and drew the bolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nA policeman\\'s hat was poked through the doorway, followed by a\\r\\nflushed, genial Irish face, and a tall, hulking body in regulation\\r\\nuniform.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m terrible dry,\" grinned Larry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you\\'ve come to the right shop,\" was Rose\\'s greeting.  \"We\\'re\\r\\njust havin\\' a little drop ourselves.  Larry, this is my new friend,\\r\\nViolet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policeman grinned again, and sat carefully upon the edge of a\\r\\nkitchen-chair, in evident fear that his bulk might prove too great\\r\\nfor it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glad to know you,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Larry\\'s on this beat nights,\" Rose explained to Violet, \"an\\' him an\\'\\r\\nthe lieutenant look after us--don\\'t you, Riley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what use is a frind if he don\\'t take care of yez, Miss Rose?\\r\\nWe do the bist we can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that.--What\\'ll it be, Larry?  We\\'re takin\\' beer, but there\\'s\\r\\nwine on the ice if you want it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll just have a small drap of liquor, ma\\'am, please,\" said Riley.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose poured and handed to him a glass of whiskey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you came by,\" she inquired, \"did you see a fat man throwin\\'\\r\\nfits in our gutter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I did not.  Have ye been afther havin\\' a rumpus the night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no--only that fat little fellow that keeps the jewelry-store\\r\\naround the corner.  He was drunk, an\\' I threw him out.  If he tries\\r\\nto get gay, let me know, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I\\'ll let ye know--an\\' here\\'s to your very good health,\\r\\nma\\'am an\\' miss.--But you may rist aisy; that there won\\'t be no\\r\\nthrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that: he\\'s too scared of his wife.--Have another, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank ye kindly,\" he said.  \"I wanted but the drap, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how are Mrs. Riley and the children?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLarry\\'s face became a web of smiling wrinkles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grand,\" he said; \"the auld woman\\'s grand--you ought to see her in\\r\\nthe new silk dress I bought \\'er the day--all grane wid fancy\\r\\ntrimmin\\'s from Six\\' Avenoo.  An\\' the kiddies is thrivin\\'.  Cecilia\\'ll\\r\\nsoon be havin\\' to go to work an\\' help the family funds, she\\'s that\\r\\nsthrong and hearty, an\\' young Van Wyck is such a divil that the\\r\\nteacher throwed him out of school.  He\\'s licked all the b\\'ys in his\\r\\nclass, an\\' I think he\\'ll end as a champeen pug.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out, still smiling, and, as he did so, Violet saw Rose, after\\r\\nstooping hurriedly, place in his hands a yellow bill.  As the door\\r\\nclosed, there came into the younger woman\\'s eyes the question that\\r\\nshe would not have dared to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yep,\" nodded Rose, \"that\\'s my week\\'s pay for what they call\\r\\nprotection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t he afraid to take it?\" Violet, thus encouraged, inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man above him isn\\'t afraid to take two-thirds of it,\" said Rose,\\r\\n\"an\\' the best of it goes past him to the district boss--it\\'s the\\r\\nregular system with the regular prices.  Oh, no, he ain\\'t afraid; an\\'\\r\\nif you ever tried to live on a copper\\'s pay, you\\'d soon be afraid not\\r\\nto take it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, returning to the parlor, bit her lip: there was indeed small\\r\\nhelp to be had from the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall help, either there or elsewhere.  She turned, naturally, only\\r\\nto the seemingly more prosperous customers, but, even by them, she\\r\\nwas met with smiling incredulity: her story was so hackneyed that it\\r\\ncould not be true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all right enough to want to get out of here,\" said her sagest\\r\\nadviser, who at least paid her the rare compliment of credence; \"but\\r\\nhow are you going to live after you get out?  You can\\'t go home; you\\r\\nhaven\\'t got any trade; you can\\'t cook; without a recommendation you\\r\\ncan\\'t get even a job at general housework or in a factory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a quiet, middle-aged widower that said this, an infrequent\\r\\nvisitor, a chief clerk in one of the departments of a large insurance\\r\\ncompany, with a reputation for liberal kindliness at Rose\\'s and, in\\r\\nhis own little world, a position of some influence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You get me out,\" said Violet, \"an\\' I\\'ll do the rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here again the gate was barred against her.  The clerk was\\r\\nburdened with a good name and a place of trust.  He could risk\\r\\nneither the one nor the other.  He was sorry, genuinely sorry--she\\r\\nsaw that; but what could he do?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening or two later that she found her first pale ray of\\r\\nencouragement, and she found it in the person of Philip Beekman, that\\r\\nsame young Beekman to whom Fritzie had casually referred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman described himself, with some accuracy, as a person of good\\r\\nfamily and bad morals.  \"We are getting so confounded poor,\" he used\\r\\nto say, \"that I sometimes doubt the former; but I have constant\\r\\nvisible evidence of the latter, and so I cling to that as the one\\r\\nsure thing in this uncertain life.\"  Had he but seen the facts, he\\r\\nmight well have considered his derelictions as the result of his\\r\\nparentage.  At her divorce, his mother had been awarded the custody\\r\\nof her only child, and, now that she had remarried, Philip was forced\\r\\nto play that neither uncommon nor congenial rôle--the part of the\\r\\nyoung man with too little training to earn a living and too much\\r\\nancestry to marry one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" he said, as he sat with Violet in the many-colored back\\r\\nparlor, a half-empty bottle between them, his usually pale face\\r\\naglow, his gray eyes filmy, and his black hair tumbled by the\\r\\nconstant passage through it of his long, nervous fingers--\"after all,\\r\\nyou see, you and I are in the same boat.  You can\\'t get out because,\\r\\nif you do, the sharks will eat you, and I daren\\'t get out because I\\r\\ncan\\'t swim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways haunted by the fear that, in some manner, her true story might\\r\\nreach her own town and her own people, Violet had told him only as\\r\\nmuch as she dared, and what she had said had moved his impulsive\\r\\ngenerosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But anyway,\" he insisted, \"you can do one thing that I can\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clutched at the straw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can get help from shore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean that if you\\'ll write a letter home, I\\'ll mail it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head: the straw crumpled in her fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no use of that,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course there is.  After all, your father\\'s your father, you see,\\r\\nand I don\\'t know a father that wouldn\\'t help his daughter out of the\\r\\nsort of mess you\\'ve got into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know one,\" said Violet, grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not till you try him, you don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do.  If you was in my place would your father----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which father?\" laughed Beekman.  \"My one won\\'t have anything to do\\r\\nwith me because I live with the other, and the other won\\'t have\\r\\nanything to do with me because I\\'m the son of his predecessor.--You\\r\\ntake my advice and write home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d never get an answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke in an even tone, but there was no mistaking the tragedy\\r\\nthat underlay it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman looked at her and blinked queerly.  He brought his fist down\\r\\nsmartly among the jangling glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a rotten shame!\" he said.  \"A dirty, rotten shame!  Why, don\\'t\\r\\nyou know that that yid who got you into this makes a business of such\\r\\nthings?  Don\\'t you know there\\'s a whole army of them that do?  I wish\\r\\nto the Lord I could do something, but there isn\\'t a policeman or a\\r\\nmagistrate in the city who\\'d listen to me--they know too well where\\r\\nthey get the jam for their bread and butter--and I can\\'t get a job\\r\\nfor even myself, let alone you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not, however, heard his last sentence.  Her blue eyes wide,\\r\\nshe was hanging on his reference to Max.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A business?\" she repeated.  \"Do you mean that men make money--that\\r\\nway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I do.\"  The film passed suddenly from Beekman\\'s eyes,\\r\\nleaving them alert with purpose.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"there is one\\r\\nthing I can do, and I don\\'t know anything that I\\'d enjoy more: you\\r\\ngive me that little kyke\\'s name, and I\\'ll push his face out of the\\r\\nback of his head!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there happened a strange thing.  She had long guessed and now\\r\\nshe knew, but guessing or knowing, she would not believe.  As much\\r\\nfor her own sanity as for Max\\'s safety, she lied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The name he gave me,\" she said, \"wasn\\'t his right one.  It wasn\\'t\\r\\neven one he mostly used.  And I never knew no other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman raised his hands in more than mock despair, and got up to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he declared, \"I don\\'t know what I can do for you.  If I got\\r\\ninto any scandal, it would punch the last hole in my meal-ticket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, who was becoming accustomed to such replies, smiled kindly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want you to get into no trouble for me,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you don\\'t, and I couldn\\'t be any use if I did.  But I\\'ll\\r\\npromise you this: I\\'ll keep my eyes open, and if anything does turn\\r\\nup, I\\'ll be Johnny-on-the-spot, all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And look here,\" pursued Beekman, \"I know that it\\'s all rot to expect\\r\\nyou to walk out of here without friends or a job; I know that, unless\\r\\nyou\\'ve got one or the other, you\\'re just simply in jail here; but if\\r\\nI can\\'t get you anything, there must be those who can.  Why don\\'t you\\r\\ntalk to the coal-men, or the gas-inspectors, or--I tell you, I\\'ve\\r\\nseen that tow-headed Dutchman who leaves the beer here.  He looks\\r\\nstraight, and he stops at the door.  Why don\\'t you talk to him?  He\\'s\\r\\nthe sort that would know of a job for--for----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman hesitated, blushing like a schoolboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my sort?\" asked Violet.  \"Maybe he is.  Thank you.  Anyhow I\\'ll\\r\\nsee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she did see.  When Beekman left her, pressing into her hand the\\r\\nlast piece of money that he would have for a week, he gave her at the\\r\\nsame time so much of hope.  Those who seemed rich could not help her;\\r\\nshe would appeal to those who were poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was up early and in the kitchen the next morning at the hour when\\r\\nshe knew the brewery-wagon would stop outside, and she sent the ebon\\r\\nCassie on an errand to the corner pharmacy.  The maid had scarcely\\r\\nclosed the door before Violet was summoned to open it to the German\\r\\nof whom Beekman had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip had observed well.  The brewery\\'s driver, who stood whistling\\r\\nin the areaway, was a short, stocky man with the neck and arms of a\\r\\ngladiator and the round, smiling face of a child.  His blue overalls\\r\\nand dark cloth cap accentuated the fairness of his hair, and his\\r\\nround inquiring eyes were alive with continual good-humor.  He had\\r\\njust piled a half-dozen cases of beer beside the doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, in her crimson kimona, took from the table the money that had\\r\\nbeen left for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning,\" she said as she handed him the bills.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe accepted the money with his left hand and, with his right, raised\\r\\nhis cap from his clustering curls.  His lips ceased whistling, half\\r\\nregretfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goot-mornin\\',\" he replied, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t you come in and have a drink?\" asked Violet, adopting Rose\\'s\\r\\nform of salutation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, t\\'ank you,\" the German shook his head.  \"I neffer trinks nussing\\r\\nbud beer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Violet, \"we have lots of that now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Und I neffer trink dot till tinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an awkward pause.  The German, not knowing how to leave\\r\\nwithout seeming rudeness, was shifting his weight from one heavily\\r\\nshod foot to the other.  The woman, uncertain how to say the words\\r\\nshe wanted to say, remained with her hand upon the knob.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t?\" she awkwardly repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, und so I t\\'ink--I t\\'ink I besser be goin\\',\" he hurriedly\\r\\nconcluded, and began to turn on his heel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe necessity for quick action roused her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait,\" she said.  And then, as he faced her again in mute wonder,\\r\\nshe pressed another bill into his hand.  \"I want you to help me,\" she\\r\\ncontinued.  \"I want to get a job somewhere, and I don\\'t want Miss\\r\\nRose to know nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked from the bill to her, still wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So-o?\" he responded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I want work--some other kind of work--and I thought perhaps you\\r\\nmight\"--her voice faltered--\"might know of some kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German\\'s mobile face underwent a quick change.  First\\r\\nastonishment and then something not far removed from tears came into\\r\\nhis childlike eyes.  He crushed the bill in his big red fist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So-o?\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I--you understand that I must have friends or a job if I am to\\r\\nget away from here, and I thought you might know of something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German bobbed his curls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know dot right vell,\" he said; \"bud I don\\' know no tshob chust\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s face darkened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" she answered, \"I only hoped maybe----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, miss,\" the driver cut in with a note of ready feeling in\\r\\nhis voice.  \"You mean all dot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About geddin\\' ozzer--aboud a real tshob.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had the clothes and a place I\\'d go this minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell, den, listen.  I\\'ve chust god a new blace; I\\'m goin\\' to be\\r\\nbar-tender ofer on Segond Avenue, bud I gan send back here if I hear\\r\\nanysing.--Your name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Violet--just Miss Violet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All righd, Miss Violet, I know some more aboud dese blaces like dis\\r\\ndan you maybe t\\'ink, und I guess maybe I gan do somesing.  Nex\\'\\r\\nSunday I dake my girl to Coney, und den ve\\'ll dalk sings ofer und\\r\\nve\\'ll see vhat Katie says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the promised delay and the growing habit of doubt,\\r\\nViolet\\'s face kindled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re good,\" she said simply, \"and I\\'ll trust you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I make nussing,\" replied the German, smiling once more, \"bud\\r\\nchust you vait: Katie gan fix it; she gan fix anysing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Violet could reply, he had resumed his whistling and run down\\r\\nthe alleyway; and she saw that he had tossed back her money on the\\r\\ntopmost beercase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII\\r\\n\\r\\nHOLIDAY\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Sunday morning in his single, dark, narrow room, Hermann\\r\\nHoffmann, the erstwhile driver of a brewery-wagon and the coming\\r\\nSecond Avenue barkeeper, arose with the dawn, just as if it had been\\r\\na workday morning, and set about his elaborate toilet, whistling.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the casual eye there would have seemed little in his surroundings\\r\\nto inspire any lyric joy.  The cell-like apartment, which was the\\r\\nonly spot on earth that Hermann might call his home, was a back room\\r\\non the top floor of a damp and gloomy tenement in a filthy court\\r\\nrunning off Houston Street near Avenue A.  Only at noon did the pale\\r\\nsunlight strain into that court, crowded all morning with malarious\\r\\ndogs and dirty, toddling babies solemnly, but vainly, trying to learn\\r\\nhow to play, and echoing all through the black night now to the\\r\\ncurses of scarred, slinking tiger-cats, now to the staggering\\r\\nfootsteps or the brawling oaths of drunkards reeling homeward through\\r\\nthe evil-smelling darkness, and again to the piercing cry of a woman\\r\\nin mortal agony or mortal fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobbins\\'s Row was no place for a policeman after nightfall, and\\r\\nscarcely a safer place for a stranger by day.  From its sagging file\\r\\nof dirty, paper-patched windows, more or less feminine shapes leaned\\r\\nout, calling gossip to their neighbors, and hauling at the pullied\\r\\nropes that, crossing the street, spread above the pedestrians a\\r\\ntossing, parti-colored canopy of \"wash.\"  You entered it by climbing\\r\\nthree rotting wooden steps, by stumbling through a wet hall, where a\\r\\nblue-burning gas-jet accentuated the sense of perpetual midnight, and\\r\\nyou could reach the room of Hermann Hoffmann only by a perilous climb\\r\\nof six flights of stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat room was as bare as any in the building.  It looked out, by a\\r\\nsingle slit in the wall, upon a light-shaft, strangely misnamed.  Its\\r\\nonly furniture was a cot, a wooden-seated chair, a washstand, and,\\r\\nbearing comb and brushes and shaving-utensils, one of those pine\\r\\nbureaus the drawers of which may be opened in ten minutes, and\\r\\nclosed, if you are lucky, in fifteen.  Yet the note of the place was\\r\\nthe note of order and of neatness; the bare floor was clean, and,\\r\\nagainst the fresh and brightly papered wall, there hung here a calico\\r\\ncurtain that hid the tenant\\'s wardrobe and there a single shelf\\r\\nbearing only, as if it were an altar consecrated to one holy object,\\r\\na thumbed and dog\\'s-eared copy of \"Das Kapital.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann plunged his ruddy face, whistling, into a bowl of water and\\r\\ndrew it out, more ruddy and whistling still.  Even the author of that\\r\\nportentous volume on the book-shelf used to sing \"Strausbourg,\" and\\r\\nHermann\\'s single anthem was \"Die Wacht Am Rhein.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill pursuing that inspiring music, he turned to the bureau and\\r\\nbegan to shave the yellow down from his cheeks and chin.  Thrust\\r\\nbetween the exaggerating mirror and its frame were two\\r\\nphotographs--the one, a trifle faded, of a matronly, kindly woman of\\r\\nhis own race, perhaps fifty years old, stiffly arrayed in a silk\\r\\ndress rigorously American, and the other, a new one, that of a young\\r\\ngirl in a great hat and unmistakably Manhattan dress, a young girl\\r\\nwith a pretty, piquant face of that distinctively American type--the\\r\\nIrish.  Perhaps these photographs distracted the German\\'s attention;\\r\\nperhaps it was only that no man living can successfully whistle and\\r\\nshave at one and the same time.  At any rate, his hand shook, and the\\r\\nrazor cut a light gash in his upper lip.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flung the offending blade from him, and it struck the mirror,\\r\\ncracking the glass across one corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach, Gott,\" he smiled, as he staunched the blood with a heavy\\r\\npressure through a rough towel; and then, in the English that he used\\r\\neven in his soliloquies: \"Dey say now dot means bad luck fer seven\\r\\nyear.  Lucky is\\'t dot I am not suberstitious!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, undisturbed, he quietly resumed his whistling, finished\\r\\nshaving, sleeked down his rebellious tow-colored curls, got into a\\r\\nnewly pressed brown suit and yellow shirt, donned a high collar and\\r\\nsalmon tie, and, setting a carefully brushed derby upon his head,\\r\\ndescended to the narrow street, the strains of \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\"\\r\\nlingering behind him through the darkened hallway.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accomplish the purpose of his early rising, he took the Third\\r\\nAvenue elevated to the Forty-second Street station.  There he bought\\r\\ntwo bouquets of carnations--one pink and the other white--and boarded\\r\\na suburban train, which bore him, at last, to one of those little\\r\\nstations that New York, which has so small time for remembrance, has\\r\\nselected for the hiding of its dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the warm sunlight of the spring morning, Hermann picked his\\r\\ncertain way among the green grass and the white-roofed habitations of\\r\\nthe sleepers, until he came upon a little plot, by no means the\\r\\ncheapest or more obscure in the burying-ground, and there, his lips\\r\\nstill pursed, but silent now, took off his shining derby and paused\\r\\nbefore the solitary white stone.  With much that was unaffectedly\\r\\nreverent, he knelt, according to his weekly custom, and placed the\\r\\nwhite carnations on the grave, and with a great deal that was just as\\r\\nunaffectedly proud, he read, also according to that custom, the\\r\\ninscription cut upon the white stone that he had purchased with what,\\r\\nwhen he paid the bill, happened to be his last dollar:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Here In Peace\\r\\n  Lies The Body Of\\r\\n  WlLHELMINA HOFFMANN,\\r\\n  Widow Of Ludwig Hoffmann,\\r\\n  Of Andernach, Rhenish Prussia,\\r\\n  Who Dep\\'t\\'d This Life, Jan. 10, 1907.\\r\\n  ------\\r\\n  \"_Wait thou, wait thou; soon thou shall rest also._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription was in English, but when he had finished reading it,\\r\\nthe dead woman\\'s son said, under his breath, the Lord\\'s Prayer in the\\r\\nlanguage of Luther, as she had taught it him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She liked me to pray,\" he shamefacedly explained to the\\r\\ncircumambient atmosphere, as if prayer in any tongue were a\\r\\ncompromise with his principles.  \"Und vhile I\\'m aboud it, I mighd as\\r\\nvell use de old langwage.  If the Herr Gott listens at all, He\\'d hear\\r\\nit some besser in de vay She said it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then he resumed his hat and his anthem, and returned to town.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie Flanagan was waiting for him as he came hurrying up the steps\\r\\nfrom the subway at Park Place--the piquant, pretty girl of the\\r\\nphotograph, in black, because her parents had died not long since,\\r\\nbut in black just as elaborate as her slender purse would permit,\\r\\nbecause she knew the full value of her raven hair and blossoming\\r\\ncheeks and tender eyes of Irish blue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach,\" gasped Hermann, \"hof I kep\\' you a long time vaitin\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only about as long as you mostly do,\" she answered.  Her voice was\\r\\nlike her eyes, and she spoke with but the charming hint of a Galway\\r\\nbrogue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German\\'s cheeks burned with humiliation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" he apologized.  \"I god up early to be on dime, bud de\\r\\ntrain vas lade from the cem\\'t\\'ry in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe understood and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s only five minutes I\\'ve been here,\" she confessed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Und I brought you a few bosies, Katie.  I d\\'ought maybe----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" she seized the carnations with a laugh of delight, and buried\\r\\nher nose in them.  \"It\\'s good y\\'are to think of such things,\\r\\nHermann--and a bad lad that y\\'are to spend the money so!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were making their way toward the Bridge, the sturdy Hoffmann\\r\\nshouldering a passage through the momentarily swelling Sunday morning\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dot liddle makes nussing,\" he proudly protested.  \"To-morrow I begin\\r\\nad my new tshob.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that,\" said Katie, \"won\\'t pay you hardly wan dollar a week\\r\\nmore\\'n the brewery did.  I dunno, but I think----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, however, her protest, for the moment, ended.  They were\\r\\ncaught, clinging together, in the whirlpool of the entrance; carried\\r\\nnearly off their feet, rushed by the ticket-window with a quick\\r\\nexchange of small coin, and, a few minutes later, were battling their\\r\\nway among the press into a waiting Coney Island train.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last charge, Hermann, his lips puckered in the battle-hymn,\\r\\ndid heroic service.  While Katie hung tightly to one arm, he used\\r\\nmanfully the elbow of the other; pushed a guard to the right; shoved\\r\\ntwo cigarette-smoking youths to the left; wriggled through the\\r\\nalready crowded platform and shot into one of the coveted\\r\\n\"cross-seats.\"  Much of the park would not be open for a month or\\r\\nmore to come, but New York was already clamoring for its playground.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie, flushed and triumphant, sank beside him, and busied herself\\r\\nwith the task of straightening her big black hat.  Hermann watched\\r\\nher in frank admiration as she sat there, her arms raised to her\\r\\nhead, in that pose which, of all others, is the most becoming to her\\r\\nsex.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you lookin\\' at?\" she archly wondered, casting a smiling,\\r\\nsidelong, blue glance at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before her the strong man was a timid child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ad de brettiest bicture in a whole vorld,\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie laughed again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Och,\" she said in gratified disapproval, \"there sure must be a\\r\\nCastle Blarney somewhere on the Rhine.  What favor are you wantin\\' to\\r\\nask me now, I wonder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce he had started, Hermann was too dogged thus to be retarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s chust de same old fafor,\" he pleaded, as, with a great creaking\\r\\nof brakes, the train began to swing upon the Bridge.  \"Now I god my\\r\\nnew tshob, Katie, there gan\\'t for nod hafin\\' our veddin\\' be no good\\r\\nreason, gan dere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s one,\" she said, still delighting in her coquetry; \"there\\'s\\r\\none reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vat is \\'t?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Its name is Father Kelly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Katie, you von\\'t led dot gount!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Und I haf to gome into your church, und--und all dem d\\'ings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann squirmed; but he knew of old that from this point she was\\r\\nneither to be persuaded nor driven.  It was a discussion that they\\r\\nhad held many a time before, and every time she would give him no\\r\\nanswer to his suit until he should surrender in this particular.\\r\\nNow, however, he considered himself about to set foot upon the\\r\\nhighroad to prosperity, and the prosperous can ill afford to skimp\\r\\nmagnanimity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_All_ righd,\" he at last somewhat ruefully conceded, though with\\r\\ncertain mental reservations into which it seemed then unnecessary to\\r\\nenter: \"I\\'m a strong von, und hof stood a lot a\\'ready, so I t\\'ink I\\r\\ngan stand dot too.  I\\'ll do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took her by surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Promise?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I bromise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No backin\\' out whatever happens?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No packin\\' oud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, God bless you then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a catch in her voice as she said it.  Into her lonely,\\r\\nhardworking life, this strong, soft-hearted, poor and cheerful German\\r\\nhad brought about all the sunshine that she had latterly known, and\\r\\nshe could think of nothing better than to give him the answer that he\\r\\nwas so honestly anxious to hear.  But, though he had become more and\\r\\nmore to her from the first evening when he had seized her as she was\\r\\nfalling from the platform of a surface-car that had started too\\r\\nquickly on its way, she had seen enough of the warfare with poverty\\r\\nin her own family to resolve that she would not marry until she could\\r\\ncontribute her share to the wages of the resulting household, and now\\r\\nshe had neither a position nor the immediate likelihood of obtaining\\r\\none.  It was hard, but she was used to hardship, and so, because she\\r\\nmust not cry, she smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann tried to grasp her hand, but she easily eluded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Den, vhen do ve say?\" he eagerly demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch as it hurt her to hurt him, she laughed her answer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as I get me fingers on a job that\\'ll pay me six dollars a\\r\\nweek, we\\'ll have Father Kelly say the words for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Katie\"--he used to say \"Gatie\" until she had teased him out of\\r\\nit--\"you don\\' mean dot!  You said--you dold me--you bromise----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe floundered in the breakers of amazement.  She turned her face\\r\\naway, and looked out of the window at the gigantic mockery of Liberty\\r\\nin the harbor; but she could not find it in her heart long to remain\\r\\nsilent.  She faced him once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s no use, Hermann,\" she said, her eyes very big and serious.\\r\\n\"Here y\\'are goin\\' to Schleger\\'s place with your first good chance at\\r\\na way as\\'ll lead you to somethin\\' worth workin\\' for--you said\\r\\nyourself it might end in a café o\\' your own--an\\' to get there you\\'ll\\r\\nbe needin\\' every blessed cent you can save.  Do you think now I could\\r\\nlook at meself in the glass mornin\\'s if I married you an\\' kep\\' you\\r\\ndown?  No, thank God, I\\'m not so bad as that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sputtered toward a protest, but she waved him down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now don\\'t be tellin\\' me that two can live as cheap as one,\" she\\r\\nsaid.  \"I seen that pleasant lie nailed this many a year, an\\' I know\\r\\nmore about housekeepin\\' in five minutes than you can learn in a\\r\\nlifetime.  Things was plenty bad five years past, an\\' now they\\'re\\r\\nworse yet.  What rent is you know, an\\' what clothes is you can\\'t even\\r\\nguess.  Here\\'s beefsteak at twenty-two cents the pound; veal up to\\r\\nthirty an\\' still goin\\' up.  The papers make a fuss an\\' get the prices\\r\\ndown three cents for three days, an\\' then the dealers put them up\\r\\nagain when none\\'s lookin\\'.  An\\' as for eggs, you can pay seventy-five\\r\\ncents a dozen for them, winters, with the hour an\\' minute of the\\r\\nlayin\\' stamped on them, if you\\'re a millionaire, or you can get nine\\r\\nfor a quarter if you hold your nose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hopeful Hermann shook his blonde head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Katie,\" he said, \"I don\\' gare if I neffer ged a gafé off my own.\\r\\nI don\\' vant a gafé: I vant you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You flatter me by the choice,\" she said; \"but if we can get along\\r\\nwithout the drink, we can\\'t get along without a bite to eat now an\\'\\r\\nthen.  No, Hermann-boy, it\\'s no use, I\\'m tellin\\' you.  I seen it\\r\\ntried.  Me father swang a pick and me mother took in washin\\'--when\\r\\nshe could get it--an\\' even then it wouldn\\'t work: the one would have\\r\\nstarved to death if the third rail hadn\\'t got him, an\\' poor mother\\r\\nkilled herself tryin\\' to keep her an\\' me.  It won\\'t work, an\\' I know\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the train hurried above the dead level of Brooklyn houses, out\\r\\nthrough the suburban monstrosities and across the dunes, the\\r\\noptimist, still an optimist, renewed his endeavors to find the chance\\r\\nfor lodging his own arguments; but all the while Katie continued to\\r\\noverwhelm him with a flow of errors.  They had almost reached the\\r\\nsandy island before Hermann, still stubbornly hopeful, elected to\\r\\ndrop the subject for the present, and took up, in its stead, the\\r\\nstory of Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke simply, which is to say forcibly, and he had an\\r\\nunderstanding, and therefore sympathetic, audience.  Katie\\'s face\\r\\nimmediately softened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The poor child!\" she murmured.  \"An\\' don\\'t I know what it is?  I\\'ve\\r\\nseen them go under, here one an\\' there another, hungry or overworked,\\r\\nevery mother\\'s daughter of them.  There was Molly Ryan, as good a\\r\\ngirl as you\\'d find in a day\\'s search of the parish, left alone with\\r\\nno one to put clothes on her back; an\\' pretty Agnes Donovan--out of\\r\\nwork for four months--her as died in the City Hospital; an\\' Giulia\\r\\nFortuni, whose father kept a fruit-stand by the Grand Street \"L\"\\r\\nstation.--What can we do for her, Hermann-boy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dot\\'s vat I vanted to ask you, Katie,\" said Hoffmann.  \"She has to\\r\\nhof friends und vork first of all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Friends she has right here; but work she must have whether or no.  I\\r\\nbegin me old search for meself in the mornin\\', an\\' I\\'ll keep eye an\\'\\r\\nmouth ready to get a job for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCynically hopeless and city-wise in regard to her own chances,\\r\\nKatie\\'s Celtic soul warmed to something of Hermann\\'s optimism in the\\r\\ncause of a sister.  She began planning at once, and when the train\\r\\ndrew up outside the tunnel-shed, she had the absent Violet\\r\\nestablished as a cloak-model in the big Lennox Department-Store, and\\r\\nengaged to marry a floor-walker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then Coney--Coney the sweetly reasonable in price and the\\r\\nextravagantly generous in provision--crowded out of her mind, for\\r\\nthat day, all thoughts save the thought of itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great many years ago--oh, a very great many years ago!--when you\\r\\nwere a little boy, your father took you to the county-fair.  You\\r\\nremember it, even yet, as a purple day in the glad calendar of your\\r\\nchildhood: the blood cattle, the show of farm implements, the prize\\r\\npumpkins, the side-shows with their fat ladies and skeleton\\r\\ngentlemen, and the suave individual that put a bean under a cup and\\r\\nthen, for a dollar, showed your shrewd parent that it was under\\r\\nanother.  But above all you remember the crowd.  Never before had you\\r\\nseen so many people in one place, never realized that there were so\\r\\nmany people in the world; and even now, out of the past, you can hear\\r\\nan awed voice saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are five thousand persons here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, back home, the county-fair, thank heaven, continues to grow.\\r\\nCattle are sleeker and pumpkins larger; the fat ladies weigh more and\\r\\nthe thin gentlemen less; the shell-game, in one form or another, aids\\r\\nthe progress of agriculture by making five dollars grow where only\\r\\none grew before.  But, in the meantime, the ugly, delightful\\r\\n\"amusement-park\" has brought the county-fair to the city-limit, and\\r\\nnearly three hundred thousand persons go to Coney Island every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the season though they were, Katie and Hermann no sooner\\r\\nstepped upon that Surf Avenue which is at once the heart and the\\r\\naorta of the Island, than they felt, as there they always felt, that\\r\\nthey had entered upon the Land of Carnival.  The broad, but crowded,\\r\\nway was dancing with the noise of festival, with the clangor of brass\\r\\nbands, the cries of venders, the smell of the circus, the tang of the\\r\\nsea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, from mixed drinks to mixed music, went not the thugs and\\r\\nblacklegs, the pallid men and the painted women that would have\\r\\nfilled such a place had it been within the borough of Manhattan.  In\\r\\ntheir stead here drove the cars of generally stolid people of\\r\\nbusiness and leisure, and here, above all, walked the workers of the\\r\\ncity, the weaker sex and the stronger, seeking holiday.  The\\r\\nfull-portion hat on the half-portion girl is as familiar to Surf\\r\\nAvenue as to the Waldorf palm-room; care is erased from the tablets\\r\\nof memory.  On Coney there is no To-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laughter of the hundreds of children rang out no more freely than\\r\\ndid that of the thousands of their elders.  Mothers with babies in\\r\\ntheir arms were young again.  Stately blondes and languorous\\r\\nbrunettes, gracefully seated on the wooden steeds of the score of\\r\\nmerry-go-rounds, rode with a dignity unsurpassed in Hyde Park or the\\r\\nBois, and never a cowboy at a round-up was more adventurous than the\\r\\nyoung East-Sider mounting a hired horse upon the Pony Track.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery nook had something to sell, and Katie had her day\\'s work in\\r\\nkeeping Hermann from stopping at each booth.  There were miles of\\r\\nscenic railways on all of which he wished to ride; there were scores\\r\\nof panorama that tempted him with pictures of every disaster from the\\r\\nSan Francisco fire to the Messina earthquake.  There were the\\r\\nfamiliar canes waiting to be caught with the familiar ring: there\\r\\nwere the familiar chutes to be shot, and the familiar \"galleries\"\\r\\nwhere the rattle of rifles recalled the battle of the Yalu.  Down on\\r\\nthe beach an army was shouting in the surf, and on every hand along\\r\\nthe jostling, good-natured street were peanuts and popcorn,\\r\\n\"crispettes\" and \"hot dogs.\"  Upon dozens of polished floors dancers\\r\\nwere slowly revolving with a marvelous ability to distinguish between\\r\\nthe time of their own orchestra and that of the band in the café\\r\\nopposite, and everywhere were picture machines and machines that sang.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheap it doubtless was, but cheap also in the sense of small cost.\\r\\nExcept in the larger cafés, the ordinary drinks sold at only five\\r\\ncents the glass, and the glasses were not an insult to the drinkers\\'\\r\\ncapacity.  Hermann and Katie had their beer at one of the smaller\\r\\nplaces.  They dined for twenty-five cents apiece, without tips, at\\r\\nthe \"Home-Made-Lunch-Room\"; they were twirled and buffeted in a\\r\\nswiftly revolving car down a series of precipitous canvas chasms,\\r\\npaying five cents apiece for the privilege of the shaking-up that, at\\r\\nhome, Hermann would have resented with a blow; and they chose the\\r\\nlast seat in the last car of a steep gravity railway, where a man\\r\\nmust hold himself aboard with one arm and his shrieking sweetheart\\r\\naboard with the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all blatant, all tawdry, all the apotheosis of the ridiculous,\\r\\nall essentially America-at-play; but when, at night, in the\\r\\nelectric-train shooting through the warm darkness, the pair returned\\r\\ncitywards, it was toward their own hard-earned and with difficulty\\r\\nretained places of shelter that they were going, like children after\\r\\na strenuous holiday of make-believe with school to begin upon the\\r\\nmorrow; and if, in most of the seats, as in that occupied by Katie\\r\\nand Hermann, girls slept with their heads resting frankly upon\\r\\nsleeping masculine shoulders, it was but a rest before conventional\\r\\npartings at home-doorways, the play-day ended for the lonely couch,\\r\\nand the work-day soon to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WESLEY DYKER\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that company of the ignoble army of martyrs over which\\r\\ncircumstances had given Rose Légère command, there were five members.\\r\\nBesides Mary, who now was Violet, Celeste, whom ancient conditions\\r\\nhad temperamentally predetermined for such service, and Fritzie, who\\r\\nhad chosen a partly moral slavery as less onerous than a wholly\\r\\neconomic servitude, there was the highly colored Englishwoman Evelyn,\\r\\nwho regarded her present station as one of the descending steps\\r\\ninevitable for everyone that set foot upon the way they all were\\r\\ntreading, and Wanda, a dark little Russian Jewess, who, as soon as\\r\\nshe had landed at the South Ferry from Ellis Island, had fallen into\\r\\nthe hands of the slave-traders, and had thenceforward persistently\\r\\nstriven upward to the place she now inhabited.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the maintenance of her authority upon these and their patrons,\\r\\nRose, unlike some of her fellows, did not have to depend upon the\\r\\nassistance of any man quartered in the house.  To the discipline of\\r\\nthe inmates her system of charge for clothes, food, and shelter was\\r\\nadmirably suited; for the regulation of the visitors the generally\\r\\nnearby person of big Larry Riley, the policeman, amply sufficed.  One\\r\\nother outsider seemed, however, to have a regular connection with the\\r\\nestablishment, and this person early excited Violet\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDressed in the extreme of fashion, as fashion is known from\\r\\nFourteenth Street southward, his gray, almost white, suits always\\r\\nfresh from the pressing-iron, and his flowered tie and ever evident\\r\\ngay silk handkerchief always glaringly new, this dapper, dark young\\r\\nman was unmistakably Neapolitan.  His glossy black hair clustered\\r\\ntight over his forehead; his brown skin shone as if rubbed with oil;\\r\\nhis eyes danced like merry, but sinister, bits of coal, and his too\\r\\nred lips were continuously, loosely, patterned to a smile that was\\r\\nmore nearly contemptuous than good-humored.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor at least a part of every evening this Italian, who always entered\\r\\nthe house from the rear and without the formality of knocking, sat in\\r\\nthe kitchen, drinking his beer with infinite leisure and, in the\\r\\nintervals of her discussions in the parlor, condescended to talk,\\r\\nlazily, with Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is he?\" asked Violet, on what was perhaps the fifth of his\\r\\nvisits that she had happened to observe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCeleste, to whom the question had been addressed, shrugged her smooth\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He ees Angel,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He don\\'t look like one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not mooch, but hees name, eet ees that: Rafael Angelelli.  Eef\\r\\nhe had the moostache, he would be almost \\'andsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rose acts like she thought a good deal of him as he is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why not?\"--Celeste raised her heavy brows.  \"\\'e ees \\'er\\r\\nsweed\\'eart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is?\" repeated Violet, who could not yet understand the masculine\\r\\nlover that would batten upon his conquest.  \"I notice he pretty\\r\\nnearly lives here, an\\' he never pays out a cent, an\\' never seems to\\r\\nwork at anything, an\\' he always wears good clothes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My child, truly!  That is the reason that I have tol\\' you: \\'e ees\\r\\n\\'er sweed\\'eart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it\\'s queer,\" said Violet, remembering another caller to whom,\\r\\nthough he was a less frequent visitor, Rose was equally attentive.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think he\\'s half as nice as that fellow who comes here in a\\r\\ntaxi--the one that always wears a dress-suit an\\' sits in the back\\r\\nparlor.  He\\'s a swell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this Celeste grew enigmatic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"that ees deeferent\"--and would say no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, it happened, not long afterward, when the black Cassie\\r\\nwas absent on her \"evening out,\" that Violet, descending the back\\r\\nstair in unshod feet to steal from the ice-chest--as was her\\r\\ncompanions\\' custom--a quiet bottle of the beer that she had come to\\r\\nlike, was brought to a palpitating stop by the sound, just then, of\\r\\nRose\\'s and Angel\\'s voices from the kitchen but a few steps below her.\\r\\nThe pair were plainly engaged in an important conversation, the woman\\r\\nhurried and frightened, the man cold and obdurate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw,\" said the Neapolitan; \"I maka naw move out o\\' deesa house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'s coming in now, I tell you,\" Rose almost supplicated.\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be in the back-parlor in half a minute, an\\' I\\'ve got to go in\\r\\nan\\' talk to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Olla righta; you go; I go alonga you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t do that; you know you can\\'t.  You know how things are\\r\\nwithout my tellin\\' you.  What makes you so stubborn all of a sudden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\' lika dees Meesta Wesley Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s no reason why you should double-cross me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'E\\'s too mucha de fina gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care what he is; you ought to know what I am.  Do you want\\r\\nto tear up your own meal-ticket and throw down your easy money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Easy mon\\'?  You maka de joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman\\'s voice noticeably changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean you want some more coin?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I won\\'t give it to you,\" Rose continued, anger darting into\\r\\nher still cautiously lowered voice.  \"I know what you\\'re doing with\\r\\nit.  I know you had a girl from a department store out at shows twice\\r\\nlast week, an\\' the second time she had a new dress on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere in the front of the house a door closed heavily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'E\\'s comin\\',\" the Italian coolly commented.  \"Do you wanta that I go\\r\\nalong in with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs quickly as it had entered, all the anger fled from Rose\\'s voice,\\r\\nand Violet, accustomed to it in command or at satisfied ease, was\\r\\namazed now to hear it swaying between terror and genuine affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t mean it!\" Rose pleaded.  \"I didn\\'t believe it when I heard\\r\\nit an\\' I don\\'t believe it now, I know how much it costs a fellow to\\r\\nlive.  Here\\'s another ten-spot.  I--I--you know how I hate Dyker, and\\r\\nAngel, you know that I love you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe listener heard Angelelli rise and heard even his voice soften,\\r\\nthough probably less with affection than with gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you talka lika de person witha gooda sense,\" he said.  \"Don\\' you\\r\\nlisten to de beega lie no more.  I lika you--nobody but only you.\\r\\nYou are de gooda girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a whispered word more, and then the kitchen door was softly\\r\\nshut and Violet heard Rose, going into the next room, welcome that\\r\\nWesley Dyker who, Violet had, to Celeste, so favorably compared with\\r\\nAngel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman on the stairs hesitated.  She wanted to pursue her\\r\\neavesdropping, and she knew that she could regain her room, should\\r\\nthe doorbell ring, before she was likely to be missed; but she was\\r\\nafraid that, in the maid\\'s absence, Rose might return to the kitchen\\r\\nfor a bottle of wine and discover her.  Accordingly she waited the\\r\\nfew minutes that were required for the first of such errands, and,\\r\\nthose over, crept forward to the lighted keyhole, ready to retreat at\\r\\nthe first intimation of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave her eye precedence over her ear, and, as it chanced that\\r\\nDyker was sitting directly in the limited shaft of her vision, she\\r\\nwas enabled to get what was her first careful view of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man but little beyond thirty, Wesley Dyker\\'s face, which might once\\r\\nwell have been handsome, was beginning to show that flaccid whiteness\\r\\nwhich must later light to red and glow to purple.  What his mouth\\r\\nmight have told, a crisp, short, brown mustache concealed, but the\\r\\nregularity of his other features lost much of its effect because of\\r\\neyes that, though large and steel gray, were heavy-lidded and\\r\\ncalculating.  Nevertheless, Violet\\'s estimate of the man was not\\r\\nwithout justification.  He spoke easily and well in the voice of\\r\\neducation; his excellently made evening clothes displayed a figure\\r\\nthat had not yet lost its admirable lines, and even the face--to one\\r\\nthat either had known it during its gradual changes, or to one that\\r\\nlacked a fund of experience for purposes of comparison--was not\\r\\nwanting in attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the sturdy Rose, whose hand he held and who was looking at him\\r\\nwith what she patently believed to be a tender expression, he was\\r\\nspeaking with a certain formal politeness that was novel in the ears\\r\\nof the listener.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think you can get it?\" Rose was asking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I have something more than a fighting chance,\" replied\\r\\nDyker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does O\\'Malley say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is at least as liberal in his promise to me as he is in his\\r\\npromise to the other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the big chief doesn\\'t yip?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Rose, you should know, by this time, enough of New York\\r\\npolitics to realize that the first qualification of a big boss is to\\r\\nhold his tongue, and that the present incumbent, whatever his other\\r\\nshortcomings, can always keep quiet as long as he has no pen in his\\r\\nhand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose freed her hand to pour the wine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I smoke?\" asked Dyker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You always ask me that, and you always know you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed and, drawing a cigarette from a plain gun-metal case,\\r\\nlighted it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" he pursued, \"I expect to win--I always expect to win,\\r\\nbecause failure may fight its way to a perch on any man\\'s banner, but\\r\\nit\\'s sure to lodge on the standard of the man that sits and waits for\\r\\nit.  But I can\\'t be sure of O\\'Malley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess whatever headquarters orders will go with him, all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the surface, perhaps; but, if he wants to, he can have his own\\r\\ncandidate run on an independent ticket, and then he can quietly knife\\r\\nme at the polls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would he have the nerve?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is precisely what he did election before last.  I am sure of\\r\\nthat, and yet nobody has ever been able to prove it.  That is where I\\r\\nlook for your help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose took his hand again, and pressed it reassuringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always take care of my friends,\" she smiled, \"and you sure have\\r\\nbeen good to me.  Where do I come in on this game?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just yet you don\\'t have to come in at all.  It may be that\\r\\neverything will be honest and above-board--I trust it will--and in\\r\\nthat case you need not disturb yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if it ain\\'t?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it isn\\'t,\"--he looked at her kindly, but keenly, from under his\\r\\nheavy lids--\"I shall want you to let me know just as soon as O\\'Malley\\r\\nbegins to make preparations for registering voters from this house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose bent forward and kissed him lightly on his flaccid cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s easy,\" she laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, but if you have to go so far at first, you will have to go\\r\\nfarther afterward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just now I want you to keep your ears open for gossip.  You are in a\\r\\nposition to hear a lot: in this house men talk that are dumb outside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who are you thinkin\\' of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Several people, friends of O\\'Malley\\'s.  There\\'s one cheap little\\r\\ncamp-follower who, I am told, gets around here rather frequently.  I\\r\\ndon\\'t suppose that he\\'s of enough importance to know much, but he\\r\\nwould be worth watching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s his name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker filled Rose\\'s glass, and poured more wine for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Angelelli,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the darkened kitchen, Violet, her eye now fast to the keyhole,\\r\\ndrew a short breath, and watched Rose as the sophisticated spectator\\r\\nwatches an emotional actress when she approaches her \"big scene.\"\\r\\nBut Rose, still the primitive Teuton of the brewery-calendar, never\\r\\nquavered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rafael Angelelli?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think so.  He is a little Italian loafer with no work and plenty\\r\\nof money.  You know him, of course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I know him.  He\\'s in an\\' out of here all the time.  We call him\\r\\n\\'Angel\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum.  Well, there are angels and angels, so that name may fit him as\\r\\nwell as any other.  There may be nothing to it, but he does hang\\r\\nabout O\\'Malley a good deal, and it might be worth your while to find\\r\\nout what, if anything, he knows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s easy,\" purred Rose.  \"Here\\'s success.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair clinked their glasses, and drained them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And--Rose?\" began Dyker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither this little fellow nor any of his crowd knows about--us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose\\'s placid smile was eminently convincing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess I know my business,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you do.  Only don\\'t let him know that you know mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Trust me for that, Wes\\' dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, if O\\'Malley could get hold of it, he would have a rather\\r\\nformidable weapon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He doesn\\'t know I ever set my lamps on you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good,\" said Dyker; \"and he mustn\\'t know it for a good many months to\\r\\ncome.  Now, then, let\\'s have just one pint more between us--only a\\r\\npint--my dear--and----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the woman at the keyhole waited to hear no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COURT OF A MERCHANT-PRINCE\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that injudicious grasping of the third-rail had snuffed out the\\r\\nlow, but stubborn, flame that a foreman had known as \"Number 12,\" and\\r\\na few score of human beings had called Michael Flanagan, his wife,\\r\\nBridget, had looked up from her washtub long enough to refuse the\\r\\noffer of a hundred dollars, made by the company\\'s claim-adjuster as\\r\\nfull payment for whatever inconvenience she might have been\\r\\noccasioned by her husband\\'s demise.  One of those very modern young\\r\\nlawyers, whose livelihood depends upon their study of the newspapers,\\r\\nand the speed of their feet, had arrived at the Flanagan tenement\\r\\nahead of the adjuster.  He had accepted a contingent fee of ten\\r\\ndollars, and thereafter, being defeated by the company\\'s expert\\r\\nattorneys in a lower court, refused, as usual, to appeal unless the\\r\\nwidow handed him a further amount of money that was wholly beyond her\\r\\nreach.  So Irish-eyed Katie was put to work, as she should in any\\r\\ncase have been put, and Mrs. Flanagan went on with her washing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\'s first position was in a second-hand clothing shop on Sixth\\r\\nAvenue, where she went to work at eight in the morning and quit at\\r\\nhalf-past ten at night.  The stock-in-trade of this place was largely\\r\\nrevived ball-gowns and opera cloaks, bought, for the most part, from\\r\\nwomen of so much means as to pretend, at least, that they never wore\\r\\nthe same gown twice, and yet of too much thrift to give their\\r\\ndiscarded clothes to charity.  Its patrons were persons that the\\r\\noriginal wearers of the gowns would have blushed to meet.  And its\\r\\nproprietress was a little lynx-eyed, hook-nosed person whose sole\\r\\nobject in life was to induce the former class to sell for less than\\r\\nthey had intended and to persuade the latter class to buy for more\\r\\nthan they could afford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe virtue of this method she impressed, by precept and example, upon\\r\\nher six girl-clerks, and she raised their profits as they raised\\r\\ntheir prices of sale.  She told, with a fine pride, how she had once\\r\\nso conducted a negotiation that a Riverside Drive husband had paid\\r\\nher nearly as much for a dress that he was buying for a Forty-seventh\\r\\nStreet acquaintance as he had first paid for the same dress when it\\r\\nwas made for his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, commissions to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Katie nor\\r\\nher companions could earn anything beyond a bare living wage.  The\\r\\nlure of clothes was always before them; their work was the handling\\r\\nand the praising of beautiful fabrics beautifully arranged.  They\\r\\nwere told that they might themselves buy of these at what the\\r\\nproprietress called a mere nothing above the cost price, but what was\\r\\nreally a considerable increase over it; they wanted to look their\\r\\nbest among their friends, and their employer insisted that they look\\r\\ntheir best to her patrons; there was not one of the half-dozen clerks\\r\\nthat was not continually from fifteen to a hundred dollars in her\\r\\nmistress\\'s debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Katie, like many another making the same fight, escaped further\\r\\ncontamination, that the contrast between the oppression of the\\r\\nhook-nosed owner on the one hand and the apparent ease and luxury of\\r\\nher customers on the other, did not tempt her,--for opportunities\\r\\nwere plenty,--from the station of clerk to purchaser, was due in part\\r\\nto her own sturdy character and to the accident of her own Celtic\\r\\ntemper.  Other girls there were who were not so destined, but Mrs.\\r\\nFlanagan\\'s weary feet one day refused to support their possessor, and\\r\\nKatie, knowing well the need of ready money for the doctor and the\\r\\ndruggist, neglected to purchase, even on credit, an expensive black\\r\\nwalking-suit that was repeatedly called to her attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say, you\\'d look just grand in this,\" said the psittacidic\\r\\nproprietress, Mrs. Binks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held the dress extended, putting its best points to the light.\\r\\nAnd all the other clerks echoed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d look just grand in it, Miss Flanagan!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would that,\" replied Katie, who was as taciturn to her employer as\\r\\nshe was loquacious to everybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you take it?\" asked Mrs. Binks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t just like it,\" lied Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Binks blinked her bead-like eyes.  That the girl\\'s reply could\\r\\nbe true was inconceivable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try it on,\" she suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s the use?  I don\\'t want it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, try it on anyway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be too busy, Mrs. Binks.  The customers \\'re startin\\' to pour in\\r\\nthis very minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then try it on at your lunch time.  I\\'ll leave it handy here, over\\r\\nthis chair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did leave it there all day long.  Katie, whose one dress was now,\\r\\nin spite of endless feminine make-shifts, beginning to show wear, had\\r\\nto go through her task with the baited hook constantly dangling\\r\\nbefore her.  Nevertheless, when the long-delayed closing hour\\r\\narrived, the suit was just where Mrs. Binks had left it.  Katie\\r\\ncarefully abstained from touching it; she would not even put it away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this?\" asked the mildly surprised owner, as she stumbled over\\r\\nthe garment.  \"I declare it\\'s that handsome walking-suit I wanted you\\r\\nto have, Miss Flanagan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie turned and regarded the neglected garment precisely as Mrs.\\r\\nBinks was regarding it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" she said, \"and is it, now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mistress looked at her, again blinking suspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you try it on?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think I want it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a fine suit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s grand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you don\\'t want it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you that you could have it for a third off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you did that, Mrs. Binks, and it\\'s thank you I do for your\\r\\nkindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum--hum.  I\\'ll take off a dollar more--for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, no, Mrs. Binks.  Good-night, Mrs. Binks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sort of thing went on, with variations, for three days, at the\\r\\nend of which time Mrs. Binks, as she would have phrased the\\r\\noccurrence, \"came right out with it\"; and for this ceremony she chose\\r\\nthat morning hour when the other girls in the shop had the greatest\\r\\namount of leisure to observe what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Flanagan,\" said she, marching up to the thoroughly prepared\\r\\nKatie, and peering hard into the serene Irish eyes of her selected\\r\\nvictim, \"I like my clerks to look well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I\\'ve been noticin\\',\" said Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' I don\\'t like to speak about it when they don\\'t,\" continued Mrs.\\r\\nBinks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re just that tender-hearted!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you girls don\\'t wear good clothes, my customers\\'ll think I\\r\\ndon\\'t treat you right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could they now, Mrs. Binks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" concluded Mrs. Binks, overlooking these interruptions in view\\r\\nof the crushing climax she was approaching, \"as you\\'ve made up your\\r\\nmind not to take the hints I\\'ve been givin\\' you, or the fine offers\\r\\nI\\'ve made you, I\\'ve got to say it plainly that you\\'re looking too\\r\\nshabby to work any more for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie smiled her warmest smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Binks,\" she replied, resorting again to prevarication, and\\r\\npresenting the greedily seized money that she still owed her\\r\\nemployer, \"I\\'d begun to be afraid that maybe them was your feelin\\'s,\\r\\nan\\' so yesterd\\'y at lunch time I bought me the exact duplicate of\\r\\nthat walking-suit you\\'ve been tryin\\' to thrust upon me--only I got it\\r\\nnext door an\\' for half your price.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying this she had walked to the shallow closet in the fitting-room,\\r\\ntaken down her hat and coat, put them on, sung \"Good-by\" to her\\r\\nconsternated fellow-workers, and strolled away forever from that\\r\\nplace of employment.  She went smiling, but, instead of the curt word\\r\\nthat she generally employed, she administered a hand-slap with her\\r\\nopen palm to a stranger that accosted her on her journey homeward.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got work, after some searching, in a candy shop on Eighth Street,\\r\\nbut this she had to relinquish when her mother\\'s speedy illness\\r\\ndeveloped into a brief and fatal disease.  It was not until the last\\r\\nnursing, relieved by Hermann\\'s assistance, and the funeral were over,\\r\\nthat she could again think of labor, and then it was only to get, in\\r\\na Fourth Street necktie factory, a small position that she lost\\r\\nbecause she had the effrontery to resent the rather frank overtures\\r\\nof the foreman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, although she had told her cheerful lover nothing about it, she\\r\\nhad come to the last ditch.  She had been deceived by advertisements,\\r\\ncheated by employment agencies, denied work by the superintendents of\\r\\nscores of shops and manufactories.  She was not a skilled laborer,\\r\\nand she had, at first, nothing in the matter of recommendation; she\\r\\nbelonged to no trade union; the rent for her little room was\\r\\ndangerously overdue; so, also, were the bills of the baker and the\\r\\nmilk dealer upon whom alone she was depending for food; all that she\\r\\ncould pledge was in pawn, and, with the soles of her shoes worn\\r\\nthrough almost to her feet, the elaborate mourning costume that she\\r\\nhad been unable to resist was her only badge of material prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo avenues of escape were open, were even persistently presented,\\r\\nyet she would regard neither.  To take what Hermann pleaded with her\\r\\nto accept, though her hungry heart and her underfed body cried out\\r\\nfor it, would have been, she felt well assured, unfairly to handicap\\r\\nher best friend, and, as for turning into that other way--a way into\\r\\nwhich the streets on every hand seemed so easily to open, she was too\\r\\nwise to consider.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No thanks,\" she answered in her soul, as she walked by the leering\\r\\nsatyrs, with her black head erect and her lips compressed--\"not yet,\\r\\nif you please: not yet, nor never, I think, for starvin\\' seems some\\r\\neasier and a deal quicker, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had to repeat the words pretty often, for they had come to be a\\r\\nsort of incantation, almost a pious ejaculation, against the enemy,\\r\\nand, as her poverty grew and her chances decreased in inverse ratio,\\r\\nthe enemy, like vultures flocking to the fatally wounded, seemed\\r\\nstartlingly to increase in force.  At first it was a well-dressed\\r\\ncorps strayed from Broadway or the Avenue; then it was the bank-clerk\\r\\nhurrying to work and the master mechanic hurrying from it; but\\r\\nfinally, so plain are the signs of distress shown upon our faces by\\r\\nthe selves that are besieged, it had become the professionally\\r\\nemploying, professedly unemployed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet at every dawn she renewed her quest, with a glass of blue milk\\r\\nand a bite of bread for breakfast.  Every day and all day she tramped\\r\\nthe long, aching streets.  And every night, despairing but resolute,\\r\\nshe came home for her supper of bread and milk and for the sleep of\\r\\nthe hungry and distressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now a Thursday morning.  The milkman had pounded at her door\\r\\nand, receiving no answer, had left no milk.  Still gnawing her crust,\\r\\nKatie slunk out of the tenement, and, at the step, was waylaid by the\\r\\nrent-collector, a little man with a sharp, white face that told\\r\\nplainly of his own struggle.  He blocked the exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-day to you, Miss Flanagan,\" he said, touching his dirty cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-mornin\\', Mr. Woods,\" she answered, aware that the hour for the\\r\\nlast engagement was approaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was one whose business forced him to mince nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was comin\\' up to git yer rent,\" he continued.  \"It\\'s three weeks\\r\\noverdue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to be askin\\' you to let it run a bit longer,\"\\r\\nsaid Katie, and her voice, in spite of all resolution, trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I\\'ve been an\\' done that twice fer you, Miss Flanagan.  The boss\\r\\nis after me as hard as I\\'m after you--an\\' harder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it.  I--you can\\'t stand him off another week, Mr. Woods?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nix on the stand-off, miss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, I\\'m--I\\'m out of a job.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that, but then you\\'ve been out o\\' one fer a good while now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, only I rather expect--indeed, I\\'ve been promised one beginnin\\'\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man coughed behind a dirty hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s Friday?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, ain\\'t you got your dates mixed?  You told me last week you had\\r\\na job promised for that Friday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie surprised even herself: she laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did!\" she said.  \"An\\' of course I was lyin\\' an\\' of course you\\r\\nknowed it.  Oh, well, Woods, man, hold \\'em off for forty-eight hours,\\r\\nan\\' if I don\\'t get work then, I\\'ll--well, I won\\'t bother you no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the shadowy hallway, she felt his eyes studying her less with evil\\r\\nthan with wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There ain\\'t many girls with your looks, Miss Flanagan, as\\'d be out\\r\\nof a job as long as you\\'ve been.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie shrugged her shoulders: she was beyond resentment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The more pity to \\'em,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not many,\" repeated Mr. Woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an awkward silence.  The collector paused because he wanted\\r\\nher fully to weigh an implication that he honestly considered to\\r\\ncontain sound advice, and Katie refrained from further comment for\\r\\nthe excellent reason that she had nothing to say.  It was Woods that\\r\\nat last took up the broken thread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do, Miss Flanagan,\" he not unkindly\\r\\nconcluded; \"I\\'ll hold \\'em off till to-morrow evenin\\', an\\' if by then\\r\\nyou can pay me a chunk on account, it\\'ll be all right; if you\\r\\ncan\\'t----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood aside, and Katie clapped him warmly on the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re doin\\' your best, Woods,\" she said, \"an\\' I thank you for it.\\r\\nI\\'ll get the job someways, but not the way you think, an\\'--an\\' I\\r\\nthank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly half-way to the corner she met the girl that lived across the\\r\\nhall from her, Carrie Berkowicz, a homely, round-cheeked,\\r\\nbrown-haired Lithuanian Jewess, who worked in a shirtwaist factory on\\r\\nTenth Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say, Katie\"--Carrie prided herself on her colloquial English, as she\\r\\nlearned it in the night-classes in the Rand School--\"were you still\\r\\nlooking for a job?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, say, I just this minute passed Emma Schrem, an\\' she says Cora\\r\\nCostigan is quitting her job at the Lennox store to-day to be married\\r\\nto-morrow.  Why don\\'t you pull up there and try for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTry for it?  Katie could scarcely stop to thank her rescuer before\\r\\nshe had turned northward.  There was no longer left her even the five\\r\\ncents necessary for carfare, and, though she was faint with hunger\\r\\nand shaking with fear lest her tardiness should lose her this slim\\r\\nopportunity, she was forced to walk.  Facing a fine rain blown in\\r\\nfrom the Sound, she walked up Second Avenue, and finally, turning\\r\\nwestward to the shopping quarter now crowded with salesgirls on their\\r\\nhurried way to work, she entered, by the dark employés\\' door, the\\r\\nlarge department-store of Joshua N. Lennox, merchant and\\r\\nphilanthropist.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dozen quick inquiries rushed her, wet and weary, but flushed by her\\r\\nwalk and radiant with the excitement of the race, into the presence\\r\\nof the frock-coated, pale-faced, suave-mouthed Mr. Porter, the tall,\\r\\nthin man, with the precision of a surgeon and the gravity of a\\r\\nSunday-school superintendent, to whose attention, it appeared, such\\r\\npleas as hers must be brought.  Mr. Porter, who had gray\\r\\nside-whiskers, which he stroked with white hands, listened in\\r\\njudicial calm to what she had to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just fill out this application-blank,\" he remarked as, breathless,\\r\\nKatie ended her little speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were in a dim, bare office under the street, the man at a\\r\\nroll-top desk lighted by a green-shaded incandescent lamp, the girl\\r\\nstanding beside him.  Mr. Porter indicated a writing-shelf along the\\r\\nopposite wall, where Katie found a pile of the blanks, and pen and\\r\\nink.  While she struggled with the task assigned her, Mr. Porter\\r\\nverified, by brief, sharp inquiries through a telephone, her\\r\\nstatement of the approaching marriage of Miss Cora Costigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie, meanwhile, was giving her age, her parentage, her birthplace,\\r\\nthe name of the firm that had last employed her--she mentioned the\\r\\ncandy-shop for that,--was cheerfully agreeing to join the \"Employés\\'\\r\\nMutual Benefit Association,\" and was putting a \"Yes,\" which she\\r\\nintended promptly to forget, to the question that asked her to become\\r\\na spy on her co-workers: \"If you saw a fellow-employé doing anything\\r\\ndetrimental to the interests of the firm, would you consider it your\\r\\nduty to report the same?\"  It was only at one of the last questions\\r\\nthat she hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please what does that mean?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter deigned to walk across the room and, close to her\\r\\nshoulder, examined the question.  It was the simple one: \"Do you live\\r\\nwith your parents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That,\" said Mr. Porter, \"is inserted because the firm wishes to have\\r\\nonly nice girls here, and those with good home influences are\\r\\nconsidered--most trustworthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter had the type of emotionless eyes that can say one sort of\\r\\nthing far better than the eyes of more temperamental people, and he\\r\\nnow met Katie\\'s steady gaze with a stare of considerable significance.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie was rather sure that she understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that,\" she said, \"if I didn\\'t live with my people, I couldn\\'t\\r\\nhave the job?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that,\" Mr. Porter corrected, \"if a girl does get a position and\\r\\nlives with her family, she will be better cared for, and we will know\\r\\nthat she is safe at home evenings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie hesitated no longer.  She took the pen and, opposite the query,\\r\\nwrote a quick \"Yes.\"  To be sure she was, on that account, obliged to\\r\\ninvent the kind of work done by her father and the amount of the\\r\\nfamily wage; but she so needed the position that her active wit at\\r\\nonce supplied the answers.  More or less truthfully, she put a word\\r\\nin reply to the remaining questions, signed her name, and wrote her\\r\\naddress.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter took the paper in his white fingers, read it slowly,\\r\\nfolded it, indorsed it with several hieroglyphics, and placed it in a\\r\\npigeon-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am filing this with our other applications,\" he said.  \"As soon as\\r\\nyour name is reached, I will see that you are notified.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie\\'s jaw dropped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I thought,\" she began, \"I thought I was to get the job now.\\r\\nI--isn\\'t Cora leavin\\', thin, after all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Costigan is leaving us, I understand,\" said Mr. Porter,\\r\\nstroking his whiskers; \"but there are others--nearly a hundred--on\\r\\nthe list ahead of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie was hungry, and hunger finds it hard to think of justice.  She\\r\\nhad borne all that she could bear.  The waiting, the walking, the\\r\\nhope and the hopelessness had gnawed the string of her courage.\\r\\nSomething snapped inside of her, and she began to sob with Irish\\r\\nunrestraint.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter was embarrassed.  He frequently had to deal harshly with\\r\\nother employés of his philanthropic employer--it was, in fact, upon\\r\\nthe performance of such duties that his living almost depended--but\\r\\nhe did not like to have tears shed in his office: it did not look\\r\\nwell for the reputation of the establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss--Miss Flanagan,\" said he, first consulting the\\r\\napplication-blank for the forgotten name, and putting one of his\\r\\nwhite hands toward the face now hidden in a crumpled handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mustn\\'t--really, you must not!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But everything depends on me gettin\\' this job!\" sobbed Katie in an\\r\\nIrish wail.  \"The rent\\'s due; me family\\'s all sick; the milkman won\\'t\\r\\nleave no more milk, an\\' I\\'ve eaten nothin\\' for Heaven knows how long!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a rush of words her story, including that of her resurrected\\r\\nfather, leaped from her.  What effect it would have had upon Mr.\\r\\nPorter had it been calmly told is beyond guessing; but it was told by\\r\\nno means calmly, and Katie\\'s voice rose to a pitch that forced him to\\r\\nsurrender out of mere fear of a prolonged scene.  Grudgingly, but\\r\\nunconditionally, he laid down his arms.  He took the telephone and\\r\\ncalled again Miss Isaacs, the buyer of the women\\'s hosiery\\r\\ndepartment, which Miss Costigan was to leave on the following day,\\r\\ntold as much of Katie\\'s story as he thought necessary, and obtained\\r\\nconsent to a trial of the girl.  He informed Katie that she might\\r\\ntake, on the next morning, the place to be vacated by Miss Costigan,\\r\\nbut he took care to impress upon her mind the fact that he was doing\\r\\nher an exceptional favor, which she was not to mention to her\\r\\nfriends, who might try to profit by her unusual experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie was on the point of calling all the saints to bless him when\\r\\nshe bethought her of a practical inquiry theretofore, in her\\r\\neagerness to secure any sort of work, neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' what\\'s the pay?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will receive,\" replied Mr. Porter in the tones in which his\\r\\nemployer announced the gift of a small fortune to a large college,\\r\\n\"four dollars and fifty cents a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie forgot the saints.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four--\" she began.  \"But, Mr. Porter,\" she concluded, \"will you be\\r\\ntellin\\' me how I\\'m to be livin\\' on all that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter\\'s calm eyes came again into significant play.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said in your application, you may recall,\" he dryly\\r\\nremarked, as he reached for that document, \"you have said that you\\r\\nlived with your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment her glance probed his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for all that,\" she said, \"I have to support meself entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter was still looking at her with his emotionless, appraising\\r\\ngaze.  He saw a girl with pretty, piquant features, with glossy black\\r\\nhair, with cheeks that bloomed even in privation and blue eyes that\\r\\nwere beautiful even in tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Flanagan,\" said he, \"most of the girls that start at these\\r\\nwages in department-stores are partly supported by their family or\\r\\nhave some friend to help them out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie flushed, but she kept her outward calm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' what if they haven\\'t got a friend?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter\\'s cold eye never wavered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They find one,\" he said; \"and I may add, Miss Flanagan, that you\\r\\nshould experience no difficulty in that direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty will do much for most of us.  For Katie it succeeded in\\r\\ncurbing a temper that, in better times, was never docile.  Beggars,\\r\\nshe reflected, cannot afford to look too closely into the source or\\r\\nsignificance of the alms they have asked.  She swallowed her wrath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you advance one week\\'s salary now?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter was distinctly surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--why, certainly I won\\'t!\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear Miss Flanagan, I have nothing to do with the payment of\\r\\nthe salaries.  Besides, this firm doesn\\'t know you; it does not even\\r\\nknow that you will come to-morrow; it does not know that, if you do\\r\\ncome, you will remain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie smiled insidiously, and Katie smiling through her tear-curled\\r\\nlashes was insidious indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Och, now, Mr. Porter,\" she protested.  \"That\\'s all well enough for\\r\\nthe green girls; but you an\\' I know that you\\'re the boss in matters\\r\\nof this sort.  Lend me two an\\' a quarter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter, pleased in spite of himself by her flattery, protested,\\r\\nbut Katie remained unconvinced.  She declared that she knew he was\\r\\nthe real authority and that she could not bear to hear him\\r\\nunderestimate himself.  And the upshot of the discussion was that,\\r\\nthough Mr. Porter could, in his official capacity, do nothing so\\r\\nunbusinesslike as to make her an advance, he would, personally, be\\r\\nglad to oblige her with a dollar and a half, and oblige her, adding a\\r\\nfatherly pat to her pink cheek, he ultimately did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" Katie responded as she took the money, and turned to go.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll report to-morrow, then, at a quarter of eight, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At quarter to eight,\" repeated Mr. Porter, slowly closing the door\\r\\nbehind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, out in the wet street, Katie was saying what she had refrained\\r\\nfrom saying in the darkened office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' as for the pay,\" she concluded, \"I can\\'t buy no automobiles with\\r\\nme loose change; but I think you\\'ll find, you limb of Satan, that I\\r\\ncan keep body an\\' soul together without a friend in the wor\\'rld!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\n\\r\\nANOTHER SPHERE\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same evening, his crisp brown mustache hiding the meaning of his\\r\\nmouth, and his drooping lids concealing the purpose of his steel-gray\\r\\neyes, Wesley Dyker, from the rooms he had rented in an East Side\\r\\nAssembly district, took a cab northwestward through the rain to\\r\\nRiverside Drive.  He was dressed precisely as he dressed to go to the\\r\\nhouse of Rose Légère, but he was bound for the house of Joshua Lennox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he had plainly been expected.  The liveried, tight-lipped\\r\\nservant, who opened the iron grill-work door for him, showed him\\r\\ndeferentially down a long tiled hall and into, not the formal white\\r\\nand gilt reception-room, but a comfortable, dimly-lighted apartment,\\r\\na smoking-room, hung with fading mediæval tapestries, the floor\\r\\ncovered with deep rugs of the Orient, and the chairs wide,\\r\\nbroad-armed, and upholstered in soft leather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Lennox will be down in a moment, sir,\" said the servant.  \"May\\r\\nI bring you anything, Mr. Dyker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley shook his well-shaped head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank you, Charles,\" he answered, and then, nodding to a\\r\\ndecanter that, under a wide, soft-shaded lamp, stood upon a corner\\r\\ntable: \"Irish?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles bowed, brought a tray, and, when Dyker had poured the\\r\\nwhiskey, added some seltzer, and lighted the cigarette that the guest\\r\\nhad taken from a wrought silver box on a nearby tabouret.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all, Charles,\" said Dyker, and the servant silently left him\\r\\nalone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley sank back in his chair with a sigh of comfort.  He liked the\\r\\nhouse of the philanthropic merchant so well that he could have wished\\r\\nits master liked him better, and when, within a few minutes, the\\r\\nmaster himself chanced into the room, Dyker was prepared to be\\r\\ndiplomatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoshua N. Lennox was the explanation of that Mr. Porter who held so\\r\\nmuch power under him.  The latter was tall and thin, the former short\\r\\nand compact, but there all physical differences ended: Mr. Porter had\\r\\nfound his model in his employer.  Here was the source of the\\r\\nseneschal\\'s gray hair and side-whiskers, his trap mouth tortured to\\r\\nthe line of benevolence, his calm gaze and his manner that combined\\r\\nthe precision of the surgeon with the gravity of the head of a\\r\\nSunday-school.  Mr. Lennox, in fact, conducted the second largest\\r\\nBible Class in New York.  He knew its textbook from the first chapter\\r\\nof Genesis to the twenty-second chapter of the Revelation, and he\\r\\nbelieved in the literal inspiration of every verse of the original\\r\\nand of every syllable of the English translation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the voice in which he habitually addressed his Bible Class,\\r\\nthe voice of one uttering a benediction, that he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley put down his glass and rose to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man before him was the perfection of that noble work of Heaven, a\\r\\nProminent Citizen.  Joshua Lennox endowed Bowery chapels with organs\\r\\nand meat-supplies; he contributed heavily to missions among the\\r\\nbenighted Japanese; he assisted in arbitrating strikes wherein his\\r\\nfellow-employers were concerned; he always served on memorial\\r\\ncommittees; and he regularly subscribed to the campaign funds of all\\r\\nmovements toward municipal political reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf his climbing wife insisted upon having liquor in the house, Mr.\\r\\nLennox never touched it.  If she served tobacco, he did not smoke.\\r\\nIf she took in a Sunday paper, written and printed on Saturday, he\\r\\nwould read no news until the appearance of the Monday journal merely\\r\\nwritten and printed on Sunday.  And if his mercantile establishment\\r\\nsold poker-chips under the pseudonym of \"counters,\" he was aware only\\r\\nthat it did not sell playing-cards.  The business he considered as\\r\\nhis creation had grown beyond the limits of his power, and though, a\\r\\ngood man and sincere, he might have done something by keeping a\\r\\ncloser eye upon his work, he was in reality as much the creature of\\r\\nconditions as his worst-paid cash-boy.  The great Frederick\\r\\ncomplained that a monarch could not know all the evil done in his\\r\\nkingdom: Joshua Lennox was so busy benefiting mankind that he had no\\r\\nleisure to observe in his own shop the state of affairs that made his\\r\\nphilanthropy financially possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are going with us to the opera, Mr. Lennox,\" said Dyker.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man shook his silvered head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said he in the slow, deliberate utterance that he had acquired\\r\\nwith his first million of dollars; \"I am on my way farther down town\\r\\nthan that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you had better come,\" urged Wesley, knowing that refusal was\\r\\ncertain.  \"This is the last performance of the season.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary,\" the merchant chuckled kindly, \"I think you had\\r\\nbetter let Marian go to the opera alone and come along with me.  I am\\r\\ngoing to the first performance of a new season.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the Municipal Improvement Mass Meeting at Cooper Union.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat made it Dyker\\'s turn to smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but I couldn\\'t do that,\" he said.  \"I\\'m on the other side, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Against good government?\"  The elder man manifestly enjoyed this\\r\\nmild thrust.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Against irregularity, Mr. Lennox.  There never has been and there\\r\\nnever can be any lasting reform from the outside.  We must clean our\\r\\nown houses.  That is why I have moved to my present address.  I\\r\\nbelieve in reform from within the party, and I believe that to effect\\r\\nthis we want men of your sort to help us indoors and not to attack us\\r\\nfrom the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe merchant\\'s cold eye looked hard at the speaker, but Dyker\\'s\\r\\nlowered lids betrayed nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Lennox, dryly; \"I heard that when Tammany Hall first\\r\\ncame into power, but I have never seen any trace of reform from the\\r\\ninside.  What I have seen is the spectacle of most of these inside\\r\\nreformers developing into leaders of the machine.  If you will take\\r\\nan older man\\'s advice, you will withdraw while there is yet time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley\\'s reply sprang ready to his lips, but, before he could utter\\r\\nit, Marian Lennox came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething of herself the girl received, no doubt, from her climbing\\r\\nmother; something, probably, from her satisfied father, and more than\\r\\nshe guessed from a narrow environment.  Nevertheless, four years at\\r\\ncollege had cultivated in her what seemed to be a spirit of\\r\\nindependence, and a brief life in the city had confirmed in her what\\r\\nshe was certain were opinions of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was tall and moved with assurance.  Her full throat rose above\\r\\nthe ermine of her cloak, supporting a delicately carved head, the\\r\\nhead of a Greek cameo, held rigidly erect.  The hair was a rich\\r\\nchestnut, the eyes large and brown, and the mouth at once firm and\\r\\nkindly.  Her skin was very fair and her gloved hands long and slender.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe caught her father\\'s concluding words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While there is yet time,\" she paraphrased, \"Mr. Dyker will withdraw\\r\\nfrom this room and get me to the opera-house before the overture has\\r\\nended.  I am so unfashionable as to want my music entire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was used to commanding her parents in their own house, and she\\r\\nthought that she was used to commanding Wesley everywhere, so that\\r\\nshe dismissed Lennox and secured Dyker\\'s entrance into her waiting\\r\\nlimousine with almost no delay whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" she remarked as she settled herself comfortably for their\\r\\ndrive; \"I rather fancy that I rescued you from a sermon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker laughed shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" he said.  \"I esteem your father so much that I\\r\\nshould like him to like me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you think that he doesn\\'t like you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that he is slow to see that two persons may differ on a\\r\\nquestion of political tactics and yet remain, both of them, honest\\r\\nmen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may they?\" bantered Marian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he lightly accepted the challenge, \"I shall take the specific\\r\\ncase.  There is no doubting your father\\'s sincerity; there is no\\r\\ndoubting the sincerity of nearly all the men that will, with him,\\r\\nto-night try to launch another of these municipal-reform parties\\r\\nwhich, if they ever get started at all, are sure to run on the rocks\\r\\nat last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And on the other hand,\" said the girl, \"I suppose I must generously\\r\\nrefuse to doubt the sincerity of Tammany Hall?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the other hand you must justly refuse to doubt the sincerity of a\\r\\nfew young men who have seen that reform-parties always end in violent\\r\\nreaction within the city and, if briefly successful, weaken the party\\r\\nin the next national campaign.  You must refuse to doubt the\\r\\nsincerity of these young men when they go into the heart of the East\\r\\nSide to live and work among the people that make up the\\r\\norganization\\'s fighting-strength.  You must believe in them when they\\r\\ntry to get nominated for even the smallest offices on the\\r\\nmachine-ticket.  And you must have faith that, if they can work\\r\\nthemselves at last into places of power, they will reform the party\\r\\nin the only way that will keep it reformed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" sighed Marian, \"it seems that it was father that I rescued\\r\\nfrom a sermon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Dyker, \"you asked me why your father and I should not\\r\\nmistrust each other, and there you have the reason.  You know what I\\r\\nam trying to do; I have told you my plans as I haven\\'t told them to\\r\\nanother human being--and you should know that I am not to be\\r\\nsuspected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a ring in his voice that touched her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" she said.  \"I beg you\\'ll forgive me.  Only really, you\\r\\nknow, you can\\'t expect father to be with you: he would have to break\\r\\nthe habit of a lifetime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t ask him to be with me; I only ask him to believe that a man\\r\\ncan work with the organization and yet have pure principles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He can\\'t even go so far as that; he says that every system is the\\r\\nreflection of the men that make it, and he says that the system you\\r\\nsupport battens on horrors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it can\\'t be the system.  The horrors existed long before the\\r\\nsystem.  Is he such a conservative as not to be able to see that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He isn\\'t a conservative; he is the one unprogressive thing in\\r\\nnature: the liberal of a preceding generation.  Only the other day I\\r\\nmentioned something I have been thinking about doing--something that\\r\\nseveral of my most conventional friends have been doing for ever so\\r\\nlong--and he was so dreadfully shocked that, though I\\'m now resolved\\r\\nupon my course, I can\\'t guess how he\\'ll take it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker\\'s curiosity was easily piqued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you proposed it,\" he said, \"I can\\'t imagine that it was such a\\r\\nvery terrible thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no; it was merely that I want to be of some use in the world and\\r\\nso have made up my mind to go in for settlement-work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley Dyker was one of those rare animals, a human being whose\\r\\nparents, though they could have arranged it otherwise, permitted him\\r\\nto be born in New York.  He had been reared, at least during the\\r\\nwinters of his earlier life, within the Borough of Manhattan, and his\\r\\nviews were, like those of most of his even less acclimated neighbors,\\r\\njust as wide as that narrow island, and no wider.  Indeed, so far as\\r\\nwere concerned his views of the proper sphere of his own womankind,\\r\\nhe limited them entirely to an extremely small portion of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you\\'re joking,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am in cold earnest,\" she assured him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s absurd.  You\\'ve--why you don\\'t know what settlement-work\\r\\nmeans!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know quite well what it means,\" said Marian.  \"I have friends\\r\\nengaged in it, as I told you, and I\\'ve been visiting them and seeing\\r\\ntheir life at close quarters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you really mean----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really mean that here we are at the Metropolitan, and that we\\r\\ncan\\'t talk on our way upstairs, and we won\\'t talk while there is\\r\\nmusic to listen to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly their car had taken its grudged place in a long procession of\\r\\nits fellows, one by one unloading the human freight before the\\r\\nbrilliantly lighted doorway.  The pavement and the steps were a\\r\\ntossing sea of silk hats, colored scarfs, and glittering headdresses.\\r\\nInto this they plunged, hurried to the crowded elevator, traversed a\\r\\nlighted corridor, passed through a short, dark passage and came out\\r\\nto the Lennox box in the great, glaring horseshoe of the opera-house.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker, baffled by the sudden stop that had been put to his protests,\\r\\nlooked moodily upon the familiar picture.  Below them, climbing to\\r\\nthe rail behind which was massed the orchestra, was the pit, white\\r\\nbosoms and bare shoulders, too distant to present, to the unassisted\\r\\neye, any hint of individuality.  Above rose the teeming galleries,\\r\\nline above line of peering faces.  And to right and left swept the\\r\\ngreat curve of the boxes splendid with lace and feathers and jewels.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw no more than that during the entire performance and, as\\r\\nMarian, even in the _entr\\'actes_, would talk of nothing but the music\\r\\nto which he had refused to listen, he heard less.  The opera was\\r\\n\"Lucia,\" and as Wesley, with a taste worthy of a more discerning\\r\\ncritic, considered that work nothing but a display of vocal\\r\\ngymnastics devised for a throat abnormally developed, he would\\r\\nprobably have been, in any case, bored.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis father, who had what his friends called \"family,\" had married\\r\\nwhat everybody called \"money,\" but had managed to invest that\\r\\ncommodity with a talent for choosing failures, and, when both parents\\r\\nhad died, Wesley, fresh from the Columbia Law School, had amazedly\\r\\nfound himself in a position where he would actually have to turn his\\r\\neducation to practical account.  For five years he held a thankless,\\r\\nunderpaid and unmentioned partnership in a well-known firm of\\r\\ncorporation-lawyers.  He drew their briefs, and developed a genuine\\r\\ntalent for the task, but he was never given a chance to plead.  The\\r\\nworm of necessity spun its cocoon in his brain, but the emerging\\r\\nbutterfly of ambition could find no way to liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, however, he was commissioned to prepare the case in defense\\r\\nof a large contractor, quite justly accused of fraud.  It happened\\r\\nthat, when the young lawyer brought the results of his week\\'s work to\\r\\nhis chief, the client in whose interests the work had been done was\\r\\ncloseted with the head of the firm, and, Dyker being presented, that\\r\\ncontractor learned of Wesley\\'s service.  At the ensuing trial the\\r\\nclient was acquitted, and remembered the service.  He lived on the\\r\\nEast Side and made most of his money from political jobs.  The rest\\r\\nfollowed simply enough.  Dyker was introduced to the powers of his\\r\\npatron\\'s district, and, thinking that he saw here the opportunity of\\r\\nwhich he had begun to despair, he had left his former employers and\\r\\nwas already shouldering his way forward among his new friends.  His\\r\\nformer acquaintances mildly wondered what the devil he was after; his\\r\\nlatter ones began to regard him as a clever fellow, and the\\r\\nnewspapers printed stories of him as a young society man that\\r\\ngratuitously gave his legal talents to the help of the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his own part, Dyker was quite certain of what he was and of what\\r\\nhe would be.  He had seen, beneath his lowered lids, that a clever\\r\\nman could gain both fortune and power through political prestige, and\\r\\nhe meant to use that means to his end.  He had also, while still with\\r\\nthe firm of corporation-lawyers, been presented to Marian Lennox by\\r\\nher opportunely-met, socially-aspiring mother, and was, whatever his\\r\\nrelation with other members of her sex, quite as much in love with\\r\\nher as he could be with anybody.  Realizing the power of her father\\'s\\r\\nfortune and the beauty of the girl herself, he had determined to\\r\\nmarry her with as little delay as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil to-night he had delayed all open pursuit, because there had not\\r\\nbeen lacking signs to free him from fear of all male rivals; but that\\r\\nMarian should thus suddenly develop a purpose in life meant that he\\r\\nwas to have a rival of a far more formidable sort.  He set his teeth\\r\\nunder his crisp mustache, folded his arms across his heart, and sat\\r\\nstolidly through the interminable opera: as soon as it was over, he\\r\\nmeant to play his first lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did play it--played it as soon as their car had crept up in answer\\r\\nto its electric-call and whisked them away into the night.  As they\\r\\nshot up the flaming street, her clean-cut profile was almost as\\r\\ndistinct as it had been in the box, and the girl, still thrilling\\r\\nwith the memory of the music she so passionately loved, was close to\\r\\nthe mood best suited to his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I talk now?\" he asked ruefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to ask if you may argue,\" she answered.  \"No, you may not\\r\\nargue against my determination, and I am a good deal surprised that a\\r\\nman of your sort should want to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t intend to argue,\" he protested, leaning the merest trifle\\r\\ntoward her.  \"I mean only to ask you if your determination is quite\\r\\nfixed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bowed her splendid head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite fixed,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that argument would not shake it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that no argument could shake it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor any persuasion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice had sunk only a semi-tone, but her feminine ear noted the\\r\\nchange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor any persuasion,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then suppose I presented to you neither argument nor persuasion, but\\r\\na condition?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there is no conceivable condition that could arise to change me.\\r\\nYou refuse to understand that I see this thing as a duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA lamp stronger than its fellows threw a quick ray full upon her\\r\\nface; her brown eyes were charmingly serious, her lips dangerously\\r\\nsweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I understand,\" responded Dyker, \"is that there is one situation\\r\\nin which a woman may find herself where there arises a duty that\\r\\ncrowds all others from the board.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hand, in the semi-darkness, sought and found her own, its glove\\r\\nwithdrawn, cool and firm and unretreating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know the situation I mean,\" he said.  \"I love you.  I love you\\r\\nso much, Marian, that I am jealous of any work that would take you\\r\\nfrom me; I want so much of your love that I can spare none of\\r\\nit--none even for the poor and suffering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that tight grasp her hand fluttered a little, but she did not\\r\\nanswer: she could not answer, because, while her brain was telling\\r\\nher that a love so rapacious was necessarily niggardly, her heart was\\r\\ncrying out that this was the love it wanted most of all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marian\"--his voice shook now with the emotion that was tugging at\\r\\nits leash--\"you\\'ve known for some months that I loved you; all last\\r\\nwinter you must have seen this coming; you can\\'t be unprepared to\\r\\nanswer me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe possessed himself of her other hand, and pressed her inert palms\\r\\nbetween his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the girl\\'s determination loomed large to her.  Through her entire\\r\\nlife she had been shut away from the real world, behind rich curtains\\r\\nand amid soft lights, until, fired with the unrest of a partial\\r\\neducation, she had chanced upon a glimpse of classmates working in\\r\\nwhat they called the slums, and now, with all the enthusiasm of\\r\\nyouth, she had resolved to join them.  A maturer woman would not have\\r\\ntaken so seriously a sudden impulse to engage in work for which she\\r\\nhad no training, but Marian was young.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not unprepared,\" she answered.  \"I did know.  But I know too\\r\\nthat there are things that can make even love a finer, a better\\r\\nemotion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words reminded her of some speech she had once heard in a play,\\r\\nand, entirely in earnest as she was, the sound of them from her own\\r\\nlips strengthened her.  She was in love with Wesley Dyker, but she\\r\\nwas more in love with renunciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, however, shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"love is something ultimate.  You can\\'t paint the\\r\\nlily; you can\\'t part it and share it; you must either cherish it or\\r\\nkill it.  Which do you mean to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car had turned into the smoother way of Riverside Drive, where\\r\\nthe lights are far fewer and less bright than Broadway\\'s.  He could\\r\\nnot see her face, but he could not doubt the resolve that was in her\\r\\nvoice as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean to take up the work that I have told you of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s folly, Marian!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had chosen the wrong term of description, and, the moment he\\r\\nuttered it, he knew that he had erred.  \"Folly\" is the word that\\r\\nyouth most resents.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian withdrew her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is strange,\" she said, \"to hear you, of all men, laugh at an\\r\\nattempt to help the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not laughing; I\\'m too serious to laugh.  I am so serious that I\\r\\ncan\\'t pick and choose phrases.  I meant only that you can\\'t help\\r\\nthese people without training----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can get training.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Without knowing them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only way to know them is to go to them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But even then, you can do so little.  These settlements accomplish\\r\\npractically nothing.  They are fads for the people that run them and\\r\\nplaythings for the people they are intended to help.  I can speak\\r\\nwith authority, and I tell you that the young men and women, the boys\\r\\nand girls, that go to them, drop in only when they have nothing else\\r\\nto do, and all the rest of the time go their own ways.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe forgot that he had said he would not argue.  He used all his power\\r\\nto convince and to persuade; but if there is one human being that\\r\\ncannot be moved from a purpose, it is a young girl with a romantic\\r\\nideal, smarting under what she conceives to be ridicule, and for the\\r\\nfirst time tasting what she believes to be the bitter-sweets of\\r\\nsacrifice.  Even when the verbal war had been carried into her own\\r\\nhouse, he could bring no concession from her.  If he was helping his\\r\\nneighbors, then he should be all the more anxious that she, as the\\r\\nwoman he wanted to be his wife, should have precisely the experience\\r\\nthat the settlement would supply her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you mean,\" he asked, \"that you do care--that you care at least\\r\\na little?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put out his hands, but she did not seem to see them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean,\" she answered, \"that we must wait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI\\r\\n\\r\\nUNDER THE LASH\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on the day following her eavesdropping upon Rose that Violet\\r\\nwas awakened early--as early as eleven o\\'clock in the morning--by a\\r\\nsudden cry.  The sound was one of some pain and more terror,\\r\\nbeginning in the high note of horrified amazement and ending in an\\r\\nattenuating moan of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet had been living in a highly charged atmosphere: she sat up in\\r\\nbed, sleep immediately banished from her brain.  She remained still\\r\\nand listened.  She heard Rose\\'s now familiar footstep.  She heard a\\r\\ndoor open and close.  She heard that cry frightfully begin again, and\\r\\nthen she heard it more frightfully stop in mid-power, cease in abrupt\\r\\nand hideous silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a discreet tapping at her own door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you alone, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the deep, contralto voice of English Evelyn, and, as Violet\\r\\nreplied in the affirmative, the woman softly entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer tall, almost thin, figure was draped in a soiled pink kimona; her\\r\\nyellow hair seemed merely to have been tossed upon her head and to\\r\\nhave been left precisely as it happened to alight; her blue eyes were\\r\\ndull, and her hard, narrow face, with its spots of high color over\\r\\nthe cheek-bones, showed more plainly than common, the usually faint\\r\\nlittle red veins that lay close below its white skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My Gawd,\" she sighed, as she sank upon the bed and curled up at its\\r\\nfoot, \"there are some things I can\\'t get accustomed to, and\\r\\nthat\"--she nodded in the direction whence the cry had come--\"that\\'s\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke in a weary voice, a voice with almost no animation, but\\r\\nwith a curious mixture of the cockney of the New Yorker and with a\\r\\nrising inflection that saved what she said from monotony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was it?\" asked Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ought to know.  It was another of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean----\"  The question trailed into nothingness on Violet\\'s\\r\\nwhitening lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Evelyn, seizing a pillow and snuggling her broad\\r\\nshoulders against it.  \"Got a cig?\"  And then, as her hostess\\r\\nproduced a box from under the mattress: \"It does so get upon my\\r\\nnerves.  Why, sometimes they come here young enough to play with\\r\\ndollies.  This time there was no more sleep for boiby.  Had to run\\r\\ndownstairs and rig a B. and S., and then come up to girlie here for\\r\\ncompany.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How--how did this happen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How the deuce do you suppose?  One story is pretty much all of them,\\r\\nmy dear, and one about as narsty as the others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, this broke me up just because I had the bad luck to hear the\\r\\ndetails, though I must say I\\'ve heard the same details often enough\\r\\nbefore.  Her people lived in a tenement in Essex Street, where it\\'s\\r\\nso crowded that the men have to come outside every evening while\\r\\ntheir wives cook the dinners--three nine-by-seven rooms, no barth and\\r\\nno privacy; four children from eighteen to ten in one room; pa, ma,\\r\\nthe boiby, and the seven-year-old in the second, and the cot in the\\r\\nkitchen-living-room rented to the lodger.  The lodger was the wiggly\\r\\nsnake under the apple-tree.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought her here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gave her, as you might say, the general directions.  But she\\'d have\\r\\ncome along of her own self sometime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How couldn\\'t she, you mean!  Those tenements are not for living\\r\\nin--there isn\\'t room for that--they\\'re just to eat in, when you\\'ve\\r\\ngot enough, and sleep in, when you can sleep, and die in, when you\\r\\nhave to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So this girl had to live outside?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the doorsteps and the roofs when it was hot, and walking up and\\r\\ndown the street when it wasn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet remembered her own home, and reflected that her excuse was\\r\\nless, because her surroundings had been better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That must have been pretty bad,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was bad, but it wasn\\'t so bad as being indoors, my dear.  That\\'s\\r\\nwhat most girls think about it anyway, and that\\'s why they never go\\r\\nhome before ten or eleven.  How else do the moving-picture shows keep\\r\\nrunning and how else do the dance-halls make their cakes and ale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The dance-halls?\"  The word was new to Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my dear, I said the dance-halls--where you pay five cents to\\r\\ndance in the dust, with the windows nailed fast to start a thirst,\\r\\nand then buy you bad beer of the kind proprietor.  That\\'s where the\\r\\nlodger took this girl, and that\\'s where she learned to drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Too much?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chuck it, dearie, chuck it.  Among all the wasters I\\'ve known, I\\'ve\\r\\nnever found one drunkard: they all called themselves moderate\\r\\ndrinkers.  Well, this girlie played double for a bit, and then met a\\r\\nnice young man that wanted to marry her next day.  She woke up here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did they drug her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did they drug you?  They don\\'t have to drug you: you know that.  The\\r\\nminute a girl tells me she was drugged, I say to myself: \\'You\\'re the\\r\\nkind that walk in and won\\'t take \"No\" for an answer.\\'  No, you catch\\r\\nflies with syrup; you don\\'t shoot them with machine-guns.  Narsty\\r\\nbusiness, no?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet was hearing for the first time how life made the net in which\\r\\nit had taken her.  She passed her hand across her burning eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seem to have seen a lot,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t I just?  I had my own little flat--to myself, too--once upon\\r\\na time, and I kept my eyes about me.  There was the Dago woman that\\r\\nowned a fruit-stand on my corner.  She lived in an alley off Houston\\r\\nStreet, and had a sixteen-year-old daughter who worked twelve hours a\\r\\nday rolling cigarettes.--Chuck me another, there\\'s a good girlie.\\r\\nThanks, awfully.--That girl hated her work--can you blame her?--met a\\r\\nman that told her she wouldn\\'t have to work any more, and good-by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She went with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Parsed out of sight completely, my dear.  Mother nearly crazy.  Went\\r\\nto the police.  Police added the girlie\\'s name to their three columns\\r\\nof other missing girls for that year, and said they couldn\\'t guess\\r\\nwhere she was.  An uncle tried to go on an inspection-tour of his\\r\\nown, and had spent about all the family cash when he got to a flat on\\r\\nWest Fortieth Street and had its girls in for the usual drinks.  He\\r\\nsaw his niece, but the bouncer knocked him down, and when he woke up\\r\\nin the arey, the happy family had moved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that was all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was all till, some two years later, the girl sent for her\\r\\nmother to come to Bellevue to see her die.  As soon as she was used\\r\\nup, they\\'d turned her out without one of the pennies she had earned\\r\\nfor them.--Narsty, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a brief pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess,\" said Violet, \"there ain\\'t much chance for you unless\\r\\nyou\\'re good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" answered the Englishwoman, \"if you\\'re good, you haven\\'t a\\r\\nchance at all.  It\\'s just a question of whether you have or haven\\'t\\r\\nenough to live on.  The best guardian of a man\\'s virtue is the worst\\r\\nenemy of a woman\\'s--and that\\'s an empty pocketbook, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Violet was in no mind for generalizations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a business, then, ain\\'t it?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A regular business,\" nodded Evelyn,--\"fifty cents up--and now that\\r\\nthey\\'ve smashed the lotteries, policy, and the races, it\\'s more of a\\r\\nbusiness than ever.  There are hundreds of young chaps all over the\\r\\ncountry who make their living by selling girls to places like\\r\\nthis--and worse than this; and there are more who make better livings\\r\\nby making one, or two, or even three girls walk the street for them.\\r\\nJust now, in New York, the street\\'s the main thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' people like Miss Rose----?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They buy the girls and pay a percentage on their work, my dear, till\\r\\nthe debt\\'s cleared.  Sometimes they give their girls nothing but\\r\\nbrass checks for every job, but whether we get brass checks or real\\r\\ncash, it\\'s all the same: board and lodging and clothes are so high\\r\\nthat we never get out of debt to the madam.  Trust her for that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a thorough knowledge of her subject, and she ran on as if her\\r\\nonly interest in it were economic.  She talked of Denver, with its\\r\\ntwo-room houses in which the front seemed one large window where the\\r\\nsole inmate displayed her wares; of Chicago with the curtained doors\\r\\nthrough which was thrust only a hand to receive the varying price of\\r\\nadmission, even a quarter of a dollar occasionally sufficing; of the\\r\\nsame city\\'s infamous club maintained by politicians for their own\\r\\ndebauches.  She told of the proprietresses making a specialty of\\r\\n\"sending out\" for girls that worked at other and ill-paid tasks by\\r\\nday; of women conducting flats on a partnership basis; of those who\\r\\nrented, for high prices, houses that would otherwise be tenantless\\r\\nbecause of poor conditions or the opening of some street that must\\r\\nsoon be cut through the premises.  She said that young girls unsoiled\\r\\nwould sometimes fetch their owners fifty dollars for their initial\\r\\ndestruction, but that, as a rule, the sums were relatively small.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Miss Rose has to pay the police,\" asked Violet; \"don\\'t she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She does just, little innocent.  And the police have to pay the\\r\\nofficers above them, and the officers above them have to pay the\\r\\nward-bosses above _them_--and there you are.  It\\'s all the worse\\r\\nsince the bosses can\\'t make any money from gambling-houses, and it\\'s\\r\\nall the worse since the business got organized and meant votes for\\r\\nthe gang at every election.--Oh,\" Evelyn broke off--\"I tell you it\\'s\\r\\nthe same in every city the world over, my dear, and you and I haven\\'t\\r\\neven the comfort of being exceptions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t people know about it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People don\\'t want to know about it.  People don\\'t want to feel\\r\\nbadly.  People say that it isn\\'t true, and that, if it is true, it\\r\\nisn\\'t fit to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever go to a dance-hall?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nForgetting her recent attitude of democracy, Evelyn raised her\\r\\npointed chin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should say not,\" she answered.  \"Only a year ago I had that\\r\\napartment of my very own.  An Africander took me out of the chorus at\\r\\nthe \\'Gaiety\\' over home,--and a good job, too--and, when he died and I\\r\\ncame here, one of the best doctors in this town took care of me.  He\\r\\nsaid he was going to marry me,\" she ended with a short laugh, \"but\\r\\nwhen his old wife died, he forgot that, and forgot me, and married a\\r\\nsociety girl young enough to be his grandchild.  Of course he died\\r\\nhimself after a few months, but that didn\\'t help me, my dear: I had\\r\\nto strike out, and now, from the best places I\\'ve come down as far as\\r\\nthis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet was still too young to feel keenly for another while herself\\r\\nin suffering, a fact that must have presented itself to Evelyn,\\r\\nbecause she turned from her own story with an easy shrug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" she pursued, \"the thing\\'s at least better run now that\\r\\nit has become a men\\'s business.  There are no jobs left at the top\\r\\nexcept the running of the houses: the men get the girls, the rents,\\r\\nand most of the profits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fritzie said they got lots of immigrants.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, rather.  Most of the Dago ditch-diggers go home every winter,\\r\\nand any one of them will bring a girl back with him as his wife if\\r\\nyou\\'ll pay him a little over the price of the passage money.  That\\'s\\r\\none way, but there are a jolly lot more, not to mention the\\r\\nmake-believe employment agencies that catch the girls by regiments.\\r\\nThe women are packed over here in the steerage like cattle, my dear,\\r\\nand ticketed like low-class freight.  All they own goes into a small\\r\\nhandbag and once they get here, they\\'re herded ten in a room till the\\r\\nagency-runners call for them.  Around Houston Street you can see\\r\\nstreets full of those nifty little agencies: they ship the girls all\\r\\nover the States.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought such things could happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you didn\\'t.  Nobody does, my dear--and that\\'s one reason\\r\\nthey do happen.  Not that the immigrants are unduly favored.  All\\r\\nover the East Side you can see families of the Chosen People going\\r\\ninto real mourning for cadet-caught girlies, just as if the poor\\r\\nthings were really dead.  The other races suffer quite as much, too,\\r\\nthough the Yankees are less likely to get into the cheaper joints.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s where they give them the brass checks?\" asked Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  The man buys the checks downstairs, on a commutation schedule,\\r\\njust the w\\'y we used to buy our drink checks in a beer garden.  The\\r\\ngirls never see real money--except when they make a touch, and then\\r\\nit\\'s not any use--because they cash in their checks to the madam, and\\r\\nshe counts them against what her young l\\'idies owe her.  Even at\\r\\nthat\"--Evelyn nearly sat upright in her animation--\"even at that,\\r\\nthey do s\\'y the men try to jew you down as badly as they do here.\\r\\nI\\'ve always noticed that the honestest man that ever lived will try\\r\\nto cheat a girl.  But you\\'ll learn it all in time, girlie.  I\\'m only\\r\\nsorry that you\\'ll never see the better plices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet missed the innuendo, but she asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then there are better and worse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right-oh!\" she said.  \"The horrid truth is, my dear, that we and\\r\\nRose are hopelessly middle-class.  I wish you could see the better,\\r\\nand as for the worse, wait till you live in a plice where there are\\r\\nsliding panels in the wall, and men are robbed every night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had been any sympathy in the Englishwoman\\'s tone, Violet\\r\\nmight have appealed to her for whatever of real assistance she could\\r\\ngive, but Evelyn\\'s scarcely interrupted monologue soon made it clear\\r\\nthat she had no help to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all rotten,\" she continued,--\"all rotten because it has to be.\\r\\nDo you fancy that, if Rose wasn\\'t sure of us, she wouldn\\'t have her\\r\\near at that keyhole now?  She can call in Angel half the time, and\\r\\none cop or another\\'s never far around the corner.  Three weeks ago\\r\\nPhil Beekman, one of her best customers, tried to balance a lamp on\\r\\nhis nose and broke it, and Riley was there to arrest him for\\r\\ndisorderly conduct before the boy could get to his wallet.  He had to\\r\\npay twenty-five dollars--half went to Riley--for that fifteen-dollar\\r\\nlamp that Rose had insured for eighteen.  We\\'re all that w\\'y; we all\\r\\nhave to be spies on the rest.  I am, you soon will be, and that\\r\\nlittle Wanda--well, of course, Rose makes too much fuss over her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Evelyn only shook her towsled yellow head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, my dear,\" she said, \"that there are some things, you know,\\r\\nthat even I don\\'t fancy discussing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was an immigrant, wasn\\'t she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" Evelyn acquiesced, with a yawn.  Already her restless\\r\\nheart was tiring of the conversation and her insistent thirst was\\r\\ncrying for more alcohol.  \"Wanda came over here to be a housemaid.\\r\\nShe landed in Philadelphia and went directly to an employment agency,\\r\\nlike a good girlie.  They took her money for their commission in\\r\\ngetting her a job, and then they sold her right over here to a\\r\\nsailors\\' joint.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For housework?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Housework?  My dear, you overact your part.  There\\'s no housework\\r\\ndone in those plices; but Wanda\\'s won her w\\'y up in the world.  Here\\r\\nshe is at Rose\\'s, if you please, though by what sort of housework I\\r\\nshan\\'t tell you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not another word, my dear.  Talking is a dry game.  After all,\\r\\ndrinking is the king of indoor sports.  Come on down and rig a bit of\\r\\nfizz.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Violet did not join in this predatory expedition.  She forgot the\\r\\nplight of the new captive whose cries she had heard; she forgot even\\r\\nthe details of Evelyn\\'s just-related case; she remembered only so\\r\\nmuch of the general situation, now made clear to her, as bore upon\\r\\nher own position, and she came at last to a pitch of crafty courage\\r\\nthat was far more promising of success than any of the hysterical\\r\\ndeterminations that she had previously experienced.  Open revolt was\\r\\nfutile; she would employ methods more circuitous, and would use\\r\\nwhatever weapons were at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, as Evelyn had said, a house of spies and eavesdroppers, and,\\r\\nat the next opportunity--which occurred that night--Violet sought\\r\\nagain her secret place of vantage on the back stairs, and listened\\r\\nagain to her jailer in conversation with the Italian.  Her time, as\\r\\nit chanced, was brief, but she heard enough to know that Wesley Dyker\\r\\nwas the subject of the conference, and that betrayal of some sort was\\r\\nits intent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothin\\' much,\" Rose was saying, in apparent answer to some question\\r\\nasked before the spy had taken up her breathless post in the darkened\\r\\nstairway.  \"I\\'ll get more out of him later on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yas,\" replied Angel, \"but how mooch?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said he thought he\\'d pull it off, all right, but wasn\\'t sure of\\r\\nO\\'Malley.  Said he\\'d got a bunch of kind words from up top, but was\\r\\nscared for fear O\\'Malley would knife him.  He\\'s a pretty wise guy for\\r\\nall he\\'s a swell, and he\\'s lookin\\' out for the double-cross from your\\r\\ncrowd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He ast you to helpa keepa lookout?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure he did.  Said if O\\'Malley\\'s man put up a bluff at runnin\\'\\r\\nindependent, I was to tip him off when O\\'Malley began registering\\r\\nvotes here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That isa good.  More?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some.  Said he wanted me to keep my ears wide for any news.  Wanted\\r\\nme to pump you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He deed?\"  The voice grew threatening.  \"Say, now, you tella me why\\r\\nhe knaw you knawa me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess he has as good ears as most people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how he knawa me an\\' you----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He don\\'t know that, Angel.  Keep your hair on.  He don\\'t know\\r\\nnothin\\' about it.  If he did, do you think he\\'d stand for it, an\\'\\r\\ncough up all these here straight tips to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Na-aw,\" the Italian drawlingly admitted, in slow mollification.\\r\\n\"Naw, maybe he woulda not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He certainly wouldn\\'t.  He don\\'t know nothin\\' about it.  What he\\'s\\r\\nafraid of is that somebody might think _he_ stood in too good here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He say that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alla right.  Now, you tella him when he comes again, O\\'Malley\\r\\nmeans----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice dropped to so low a whisper that Violet could hear no more,\\r\\nand, before it was raised, the doorbell had sounded and she had heard\\r\\nCeleste, upstairs, calling her.  She tiptoed back to the upper\\r\\nhallway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cassie say you\\' New York Central frien\\' ees askin\\' for you,\"\\r\\nvolunteered the French girl as they met.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" answered Violet.  \"I\\'ll be right down.  I was trying to\\r\\nswipe a bottle.  And say, Celeste, how does that Wesley Dyker come to\\r\\nhave such a pull with Miss Rose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh-h!  You don\\' know?  That Wes\\' Dyk\\' \\'e mabby be a magistrate nex\\'\\r\\n\\'lection.  \\'E\\'s one gran\\' man now for bail an\\' lawyer when trouble\\r\\ncome.--\\'Es\\'s frien\\'s with so many politicians, too.  But Meess Rose,\\r\\nshe know \\'e will be some more eef \\'e be \\'lected magistrate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I see.  But doesn\\'t she keep standing in, on the quiet, with the\\r\\nother people who want the place, too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCeleste nodded a cheerful agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But of a certainty,\" she said.  \"Meess Rose, she know \\'er beezness.\\r\\nWhoever get that \\'lection, Meess Rose, she will \\'ave been \\'ees\\r\\nfrien\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet asked no more.  She had learned enough to put into her hands\\r\\nthe best weapon just then available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII\\r\\n\\r\\nON STRIKE\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie Flanagan arrived at the Lennox department-store every morning\\r\\nat a quarter to eight o\\'clock.  She passed through the employés\\' dark\\r\\nentrance, a unit in a horde of other workers, and registered the\\r\\ninstant of her arrival on a time-machine that could in no wise be\\r\\nsuborned to perjury.  She hung up her wraps in a subterranean\\r\\ncloak-room, and, hurrying to the counter to which she was assigned,\\r\\nfirst helped in \"laying out the stock,\" and then stood behind her\\r\\nwares, exhibiting, cajoling, selling, until an hour before noon.  At\\r\\nthat time she was permitted to run away for exactly forty-five\\r\\nminutes for the glass of milk and two pieces of bread and jam that\\r\\ncomposed her luncheon.  This repast disposed of, she returned to the\\r\\ncounter and remained behind it, standing like a war-worn watcher on\\r\\nthe ramparts of a beleaguered city, till the store closed at six,\\r\\nwhen there remained to her at least fifteen minutes more of work\\r\\nbefore her sales-book was balanced and the wares covered up for the\\r\\nnight.  There were times indeed when she did not leave the store\\r\\nuntil seven o\\'clock, but those times were caused rather by customers\\r\\nthan by the management of the store, which could prevent new shoppers\\r\\nfrom entering the doors after six, but could hardly turn out those\\r\\nalready inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe automatic time-machine and a score of more annoying, and equally\\r\\nautomatic, human beings, kept watch upon all that she did.  The\\r\\nformer, in addition to the floor-walker in her section of the store,\\r\\nrecorded her every going and coming, the latter reported every\\r\\nmovement not prescribed by the regulations of the establishment; and\\r\\nthe result upon Katie and her fellow-workers was much the result\\r\\nobservable upon condemned assassins under the unwinking surveillance\\r\\nof the Death Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Katie was late, she was fined ten cents for each offense.  She was\\r\\nreprimanded if her portion of the counter was disordered after a\\r\\nmauling by careless customers.  She was fined for all mistakes she\\r\\nmade in the matter of prices and the additions on her sales-book; and\\r\\nshe was fined if, having asked the floor-walker for three or five\\r\\nminutes to leave the floor in order to tidy her hair and hands, in\\r\\nconstant need of attention through the rapidity of her work and the\\r\\nhandling of her dyed wares, she exceeded her time limit by so much as\\r\\na few seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no seats behind the counters, and Katie, whatever her\\r\\nphysical condition, remained on her feet all day long unless she\\r\\ncould arrange for relief by a fellow-worker during that worker\\'s\\r\\nluncheon time.  There was no place for rest save a damp, ill-lighted\\r\\n\"Recreation Room\" in the basement, furnished with a piano that nobody\\r\\nhad time to play, magazines that nobody had time to read, and wicker\\r\\nchairs in which nobody had time to sit.  All that one might do was to\\r\\nserve the whims and accept the scoldings of women customers who knew\\r\\ntoo ill, or too well, what they wanted to buy; keep a tight rein upon\\r\\none\\'s indignation at strolling men who did not intend to buy anything\\r\\nthat the shop advertised; be servilely smiling under the innuendoes\\r\\nof the high-collared floor-walkers, in order to escape their wrath;\\r\\nmaintain a sharp outlook for the \"spotters,\" or paid spies of the\\r\\nestablishment; thwart, if possible, those pretending purchasers who\\r\\nwere scouts sent from other stores, and watch for shop-lifters on the\\r\\none hand and the firm\\'s detectives on the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ain\\'t a cinch, by no means\"--thus ran the departing Cora\\r\\nCostigan\\'s advice to her successor--\"but it ain\\'t nothin\\' now to what\\r\\nit will be in the holidays.  I\\'d rather be dead than work in the\\r\\ntoy-department in December--I wonder if the kids guess how we that\\r\\nsells \\'em hates the sight of their playthings--and I\\'d rather be dead\\r\\n_an\\'_ damned than work in the accounting-department.  A girl friend\\r\\nof mine worked there last year,--only it was over to Malcare\\'s\\r\\nstore--an\\' didn\\'t get through her Christmas Eve work till two on\\r\\nChristmas morning, an\\' she lived over on Staten Island.  She\\r\\noverslept on the twenty-sixth, an\\' they docked her a half-week\\'s pay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' don\\'t never,\" concluded Cora, \"don\\'t never let \\'em transfer you\\r\\nto the exchange department.  The people that exchange things all\\r\\nbelong in the psychopathic ward at Bellevue--them that don\\'t belong\\r\\nin Sing Sing.  Half the goods they bring back have been used for\\r\\ndays, an\\' when the store ties a tag on a sent-on-approval opera\\r\\ncloak, the women wriggle the tag inside, an\\' wear it to the theater\\r\\nwith a scarf draped over the string.  Thank God, I\\'m goin\\' to be\\r\\nmarried!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these conditions Katie found many imperative duties, but none\\r\\nquite so immediately imperative as the repression of Mr. Porter.  She\\r\\nhad not made her first sale at the main women\\'s hosiery counter on\\r\\nthe first floor, to which she had been assigned on her\\r\\narrival--pretty girls always being favored with first-floor\\r\\npositions--when that tall, gray-whiskered gentleman, his duties in\\r\\nhis underground office not at this hour holding him, majestically\\r\\napproached her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning, Miss Flanagan,\" he said, with a beneficent smile, as\\r\\nhe placed his white hand upon her quailing shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie became very busy with the stock that was new to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Porter,\" she answered.--\"Say, Miss Isaacs, how\\r\\nmuch do these lisle ones sell at?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought,\" said Mr. Porter, fixing her with his apparently\\r\\nemotionless gaze, \"that I would just come over and see if you were\\r\\nwell taken care of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None better, Mr. Porter.\"  Katie smiled sweetly as she said it, and\\r\\nstill more sweetly as she significantly added: \"Them\\'s always taken\\r\\ngood care of as are used to takin\\' good care of themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter blinked, but his expression, or lack of expression, did\\r\\nnot alter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt,\" he responded, as he reluctantly made ready to go away;\\r\\n\"but I shall be glad to be of help at any time I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I shall drop around now and then to see that all goes well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I was always interested in Miss Costigan--very much\\r\\ninterested, and she was very pleasant to me--and I am naturally very\\r\\nmuch interested in her successor, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, by the way, Miss Flanagan,\" he added as his Parthian shaft, \"I\\r\\ntrust you won\\'t worry over that little loan, you know; there\\'s no\\r\\nhurry in the world about repayment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie met his vacant glance with the innocent eyes of a grateful\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s kind you are, Mr. Porter,\" she answered, \"and since you say\\r\\nit, I shan\\'t worry, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for all that, she did not by any means dismiss the man from her\\r\\nthoughts.  Her true schooling had been received from the textbook of\\r\\nlife, and she had readily observed in Porter\\'s demeanor the tokens\\r\\nthat announced the beginning of a chase.  To one class of hunters\\r\\nthere is no closed season, and Katie knew that this class considered\\r\\nher and her kind fair game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been occasions when she had debated seriously, sometimes\\r\\nwith herself and sometimes with a companion, whether it was worth\\r\\nwhile to continue the flight, whether from three to six years of\\r\\ncaptivity, of toil that must end in death, but that was at least\\r\\nassured of food, were not to be preferred to the continuance of a\\r\\nprecarious dodging through the industrial forest with the possibility\\r\\nof starvation lurking behind every bush.  But this question she had\\r\\nalways, thus far, answered in the negative, at first because of her\\r\\ninherent disinclination to confess defeat in any struggle that\\r\\nengaged her, and at last because of Hermann Hoffmann.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Katie\\'s cheerful cynicism that blind optimist was an object of\\r\\nunfailing tenderness.  She knew how he had been left, when his\\r\\nfather\\'s heart was broken after a long battle against an oppressive\\r\\nlandlord system, with a gentle mother whom he worshiped and who thus\\r\\nbecame entirely dependent upon him; how he had sold the few remaining\\r\\nfamily belongings, escaped the threat of a compulsory military\\r\\nservice that would have left Frau Hoffmann in destitution, and come,\\r\\nlured by the glittering promises of one of the immigration agents of\\r\\na steamship company, to the land where he had been told there existed\\r\\nequality of opportunity for all men.  And he had told Katie, in his\\r\\nconvincingly simple English, how, a shred at a time, the fabric of\\r\\nhis ideal had been torn away; how bitterly he had toiled only to keep\\r\\nhis foothold; how the little mother had fallen beneath the stress,\\r\\nand yet how, to the last, he still retained his high hope, and still\\r\\ndreamed of a genuine democracy in a country where the men that worked\\r\\nwould eventually become the owners of the wealth that their hands\\r\\ncreated.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was thinking of this when, that night, she returned to her\\r\\ntenement and found waiting at her door her neighbor Carrie Berkowicz,\\r\\nthe shirt-waist worker, who had told her of the chance of a position\\r\\nat the Lennox shop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello,\" said Katie.  \"Lookin\\' for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie led the way and lit the lamp, which threw a kindly light over\\r\\nthe neat, bare room, with its stiff wooden chairs, its\\r\\noilcloth-covered table, and the lithograph of Our Lady of the Rosary\\r\\ntacked against the room door.  A gas-stove, a cot, a bureau, and a\\r\\nscreened-off sink completed the furnishings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m just gettin\\' a bite of supper,\" she said, before she asked the\\r\\ncause of Carrie\\'s visit.  \"You\\'d better have some.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank you,\" replied the caller, with her careful night-school\\r\\ninflection.  \"I had mine early.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie looked at the speaker, whose round cheeks seemed drawn in a new\\r\\ndetermination, and whose jaw was swollen as if from a blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you get through so early, Carrie?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Lithuanian\\'s eyes sparkled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve done it,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gone out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Struck?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know how it was,\" she explained; \"all the girls around here do.\\r\\nWe\\'ve had to work all day long from early morning till late night,\\r\\nSundays too, and five dollars for the seven days is counted pretty\\r\\ngood wages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But somebody said the firms\\' books showed your pay was higher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, the books did show it.  You see, they carry only a few of us on\\r\\ntheir salary list, and then each of the foremen hires helpers paid\\r\\nout of one girl\\'s wages.  You know as well as I do that most of us\\r\\nlive on oatmeal and crackers, and rent one bed in somebody else\\'s\\r\\ntenement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie was acquainted with enough of the shirt-waist makers to be\\r\\naware that this was true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so,\" she granted; \"only I thought them things were all ended\\r\\nafter the last row.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, they weren\\'t ended; they were only helped for a few months,\\r\\nand now it\\'s summer and most of us would have been laid off.  It\\'s\\r\\nthe worst time to strike--we know that--but things came to a point\\r\\nwhere we had to make a fight, or there wouldn\\'t have been any of us\\r\\nleft to fight when a better time did come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re talkin\\' about the union?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that\\'s the real point.  The bosses started a union of their\\r\\nown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Among themselves?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--they\\'ve always had that.  I mean they got the new girls into\\r\\nwhat they called a beneficial association, with the bosses for\\r\\nofficers.  If you join that, you get all sorts of favors, but you\\r\\ncan\\'t join unless you leave the old union.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, as soon as they get the beneficial association full\\r\\nenough, they discharge the union girls and, little by little,\\r\\nwithdraw the privileges from the Association members, so that things\\r\\ngo back to where they were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl spoke quietly, but Katie remembered many of the evils that\\r\\nCarrie had not mentioned.  She recalled how each moment\\'s pause in\\r\\nwork meant a deduction from the worker\\'s pay; how the elaborate\\r\\nsystem of fines taxed the girl whose fingers left her task to\\r\\nrearrange a straying lock of hair, and how the tears forced by\\r\\noverstrained nerves or over-exerted muscles cost the offender almost\\r\\na fixed price apiece; how the girls that did piecework received no\\r\\nmoney unless they brought the little check for every article made,\\r\\nthe firm thereby saving, through the inevitable loss of some of these\\r\\nchecks, a proportion of payment as well known to them and as certain\\r\\nas the mortality rates of life insurance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' so you went out, Carrie?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; they turned down our committee at three o\\'clock this afternoon,\\r\\nand at three-fifteen we had all left the shops.  Oh, it was great!\\r\\nBut they\\'ve got a lot of hands left, and they\\'ll have some of their\\r\\norders filled in Newark.  I don\\'t know how it will end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bosses wouldn\\'t budge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not an inch.  The most they did was to get some of us aside, each\\r\\naway from the rest, and offer us seven dollars a week apiece if we\\'d\\r\\nfix things up so that our friends would go back to work without any\\r\\nmore trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie, who well knew what seven dollars a week must mean to this\\r\\ncalm, hardworking Lithuanian girl, who had come to America alone and\\r\\nwas saving to send her parents money enough to follow, shot a\\r\\nsidelong glance at the speaker; but Carrie\\'s tone had not changed;\\r\\nshe seemed unaware that she was narrating anything unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' you turned down the offer?\" asked Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last strike,\" said Carrie, \"one of those union girls was sent out to\\r\\nsell copies of a special edition of _The Call_ for the benefit of the\\r\\nstrikers.  She hadn\\'t had anything to eat for three days.  One man\\r\\ngave her a five-dollar bill for a single paper.  Nobody saw him give\\r\\nit; she didn\\'t have to account for it; and she was nearly starved;\\r\\nbut she came back and turned in that whole five dollars to the fund.\\r\\nThat was one of the girls I was representing this afternoon.  Do you\\r\\nsuppose I could go back on such girls?  Do you suppose I could help\\r\\nmyself when I knew it was hurting the others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie did not immediately reply, but her blue eyes shone.  Presently\\r\\nshe asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Picket-duty, now, for yours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I began it right away.  I spoke to one scab as she came out--just\\r\\nasked her wouldn\\'t she join the union for her own good and ours--just\\r\\nlaid my hand on her wrist--but they had the cops ready and their own\\r\\nstrong-arm men, and had three of them beating me for my pains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pinched?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course.  The magistrate let me off with a lecture on the rights\\r\\nof every girl to work for starvation-wages if she felt like doing it\\r\\nand like making others starve.--But next time it will be a fine or\\r\\nthe workhouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie had begun to busy herself with the preparations for her meal.\\r\\nShe had warmed some coffee on the gas-stove and taken from the\\r\\ncupboard a roll and a few slices of dried beef.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" she said, stopping in the midst of this task; \"how much\\r\\nmoney have you got?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'m all right, thanks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe you are, but you might as well be better.  Now, the while the\\r\\nstrike lasts, just you give up that room acrost the hall an\\' come\\r\\nover here with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie\\'s brown locks shook in doubtful refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re the real goods,\" she said; \"but I don\\'t have to do that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you don\\'t have to, but I\\'d take it a real kindness.\\r\\nWhat\\'s the use o\\' keepin\\' a whole room to yourself when you\\'ll be\\r\\nspendin\\' parts of the time in jail?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you let me pay half?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then perhaps----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s settled,\" ended Katie, and it was arranged that Carrie\\'s few\\r\\nsticks of furniture should be moved into the Irish girl\\'s quarters\\r\\nthe next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe details had just been settled when Hermann entered, his cheerful\\r\\nlips concluding the last bar of \"Die Wacht Am Rhein.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" said Katie, smiling.  \"Are you out of a job, too?  Or are\\r\\nyou just goin\\' to be late the night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann pulled his cap from his blonde curls and, with blushing\\r\\ncheeks, grinned broadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Needer,\" he answered.  \"I\\'m chust on my vay to de saloon.\"  He\\r\\ntwisted his cap between his awkward fingers.  \"I vanted only to ask\\r\\nyou somesing, Katie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right.  Sit down an\\' ask it.  You know Carrie.  Don\\'t mind her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I know her, only----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie rose.  She was aware of the pair\\'s relations, and too firmly\\r\\nbound by East Side etiquette to think it well to make of herself that\\r\\nthird person who constitutes a crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to be going,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you pay no attention to him,\" Katie objected.  \"Sit still.\\r\\nHave some coffee, Hermann-boy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hermann shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank you,\" he said.  \"I\\'ve got chust a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what was it you were wishin\\' to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aboud dot girl I dalked to you aboud on our vay to Coney.  You see\\r\\nnow you have a tshob, it seemed like ve might do somesing for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie dropped all trace of banter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you how it is, Hermann,\" she said, and she did tell him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had secured her place, she had determined to help.  At\\r\\npresent much financial assistance was impossible, and employment\\r\\nthere was none.  It would be dangerous, moreover, to all\\r\\nconcerned--not least of all to Violet--for the girl to make a dash\\r\\nfor liberty in any manner that would give to Rose a chance to secure\\r\\nvengeance through her friends the police.  But Katie was decided, and\\r\\nCarrie at once agreed, that, could the escape be arranged, Violet\\r\\nmight at least be sheltered in Katie\\'s room until some work should be\\r\\nfound for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All I want to know, Hermann-boy,\" concluded Katie, \"is however in\\r\\nthe world we\\'re goin\\' to get word to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dot\\'s chust vat I vanted fer to tell you aboud,\" said Hermann.  \"You\\r\\nknow Conrad Schultz.  He\\'s now got my route vith de brewery-vagon.\\r\\nDe stable\\'s chust two doors round de corner.  I\\'ve explained to him,\\r\\nund he\\'ll slip a note to Miss Violet the first dime he sees her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll write to-night,\" said Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' I\\'ll hand it to him on my way to work in th\\' mornin\\',\" added\\r\\nKatie.  \"Now you run along or you\\'ll be docked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann assented, smiling.  He turned to the door, fumbled with the\\r\\nknob, and dropped his cap.  Katie, a steaming cup of coffee in one\\r\\nhand, stooped to recover it just as Hermann himself bent forward.  In\\r\\nthe presence of a third person, the German felt a sudden thrill of\\r\\ncourage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach, but you\\'re a goot girl, Katie!\" he cried.  \"Und here\\'s a liddle\\r\\nrevard fer it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seized his cap, jerked her black head toward him, and imprinted a\\r\\nresounding kiss on her pink cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie laughed and broke free.  She spilled some of the coffee, but\\r\\nshe administered a smart blow with her open palm on the offending\\r\\nmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d never dared to do it if you hadn\\'t thought I had me hands\\r\\nfull!\" she called after her lover as he clattered heavily and happily\\r\\ndown the stairs.  \"An\\' just in revenge for that,\" she added, still\\r\\nblushing, to Carrie, as she closed the door, \"me an\\' you\\'ll go out\\r\\nfor a little spree of our own to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where to?\" asked the factory-girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To a dance,\" answered Katie.  \"Me feet have got that lazy walkin\\'\\r\\nafter a job that I\\'m afraid they\\'ll forget all the dancin\\'-steps they\\r\\never knew, unless I hurry an\\' get some practicin\\' again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Carrie, doubtfully, \"I\\'ve got to get up early in\\r\\nthe morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' what about me?  Besides, haven\\'t I got me friend, the\\r\\nalarm-clock?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my jaw\\'s smashed from that fight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'ll see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let\\'s make it a moving-picture show.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' pay the same for half an hour\\'s headache that we could get a\\r\\nwhole night\\'s dancin\\' for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to be walking the picket-line all day to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, an\\' I have to be standin\\' behind a counter.  You haven\\'t got\\r\\nnothin\\' on me there.  Get your wraps together now an\\' come ahead,\\r\\nCarrie.  I hear there\\'s a new place opened on Grand Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie knew how to dance--the poorest girl on the East Side knows\\r\\nthat, because not to dance is to miss the one amusement obtainable by\\r\\nthe very poor--and, like Katie, she was of that relatively small army\\r\\nthat can frequent the dance-halls for perhaps as much as a year\\r\\nwithout contamination.  Before she had taken her course at the\\r\\nnight-school, she had even danced in the rooms that the Hebrew\\r\\npoliticians provide behind their saloons near Houston Street, where\\r\\nshe had seen cadets successfully ply their trade among bland-faced\\r\\nimmigrant girls whose very language was unknown to them; and she was\\r\\ntherefore wholly prepared for the picture that she confronted when,\\r\\nKatie having paid her ten cents for the two admissions, they entered\\r\\nthe low-ceilinged basement of a saloon and tenement-house, and came\\r\\nupon the meeting-place of the Danny Delancy Social Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a veil of dust raised by stamping feet and swirling skirts,\\r\\nthrough a cloud of heat from a room with every window closed, through\\r\\na blast of odors compounded of the fumes of alcohol, the scent of\\r\\ntobacco, and the miasma of sweating men and women, there rose, from\\r\\nsomewhere, the cries of a beaten piano, struck and thumped into a\\r\\nshrieking likeness to the \"Chocolate Soldier\" waltz, which only now\\r\\nand then was made at all audible above the rhythmic hubbub.  Although\\r\\nthe evenings of Saturdays and Sundays were the most popular for\\r\\ndancing, the floor was so crowded that only the expertness of these\\r\\ntrained dancers prevented collision and panic.  The steam from the\\r\\nbodies of the performers joined with the dry dust in half obscuring\\r\\nthe blue-burning gas.  The strident laughter of the patrons helped\\r\\nthe scraping of their feet in subduing the sounds of the piano.  The\\r\\nmen gyrated grimly in wet shirt-sleeves, and the women, affecting the\\r\\nmost somber shades chosen for the longest wear, spun in their\\r\\npartners\\' arms with stolid, gum-grinding jaws and lips that were\\r\\nmirthless.  Except for the youthful \"spielers\" admitted without\\r\\ncharge, or even hired, to dance with the awkward or make wall-flowers\\r\\nsufficiently happy to insure their return, there were but two types\\r\\nof men among the patrons.  There was the native of the quarter,\\r\\nheavy-faced, large-muscled, quick to anger and ready with the fists,\\r\\na hard-drinking, hard-living sort, no more careful of his neighbor\\'s\\r\\nmorals than of his own, yet good-natured, easy-going, pliable.  And\\r\\nwinding in and out among these, slow and suave, like some sleek\\r\\nspecies of vulture, were the young men that came there not for\\r\\npleasure, but for profit, always-smiling young men with manners\\r\\noffensively elaborate, whose shining black hair smelled of oil, whose\\r\\nskin was like decaying dough, and whose entire time was spent in\\r\\nmaking the acquaintance of new girls, giving dancing-lessons to new\\r\\ngirls in crowded corners, and taking new girls into the adjoining\\r\\nback-bar for a drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo these types the attending women more or less corresponded.  Most\\r\\nof them came alone, or in groups of two or three--a plain girl always\\r\\nbefriended by one of more charm--because etiquette demanded that, if\\r\\na man brought a companion, his companion must give him what dances he\\r\\nwanted, and so she would have few offers from his fellows, who\\r\\nobserved a rigid code that forbade poaching upon a friend\\'s preserve.\\r\\nThere were some that could afford to wear gay dresses because they\\r\\nwere frankly in a business that, of however brief duration, made gay\\r\\ndresses possible as a luxury and necessary as an advertisement, and\\r\\nthis appearance of wealth was never absent from the hungry eyes of\\r\\nthe young women about them.  There were others, also few, who were\\r\\nplainly new either to the country or to this particular form of\\r\\namusement.  But the majority came from the factories and shops, lured\\r\\nby nothing worse than youth\\'s natural craving for its right to\\r\\npleasure, seeking to forget the exertions of the day in these new\\r\\nexertions of the night, drifting whither they neither knew nor\\r\\ngreatly cared, the necessary factors of an industrial system too\\r\\nfatuous to conserve their efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn every chair along the reeking walls, now trodden underfoot on the\\r\\nfloor, and now picked up like dry leaves and twirled about in the\\r\\nlittle eddies of warm air created by the romping dancers, were cards\\r\\nand handbills--\"throwaways\" the patrons called them--which, often in\\r\\ncurious English, announced special balls and \"grand receptions\"\\r\\nshortly to be given in this or some similar club.  Here one was\\r\\n\"cordially invited\" to the \"third annual dance given by the two\\r\\nwell-known friends, Greaser Einstein and Kid Boslair, at New\\r\\nStarlight Hall, Gents Twenty-five and Ladies Fifteen\"; there one was\\r\\ncautioned not to miss the \"Devil Dance\" that would form a part of the\\r\\nforthcoming \"reception of the Harry Cronin Association, Young Theo,\\r\\nfloor-manager\"; and again, one was told that the \"Special Extra Event\\r\\nof the Season\" would be the ball of the \"Ryan McCall Social,\\r\\nIncorporated, Tammany Hall, ticket admit gent including wardrobe,\\r\\nThirty-five cents; ladies free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie and the shirtwaist-maker got seats near the door, waved and\\r\\ncalled to half a dozen acquaintances and strained their eyes to see\\r\\nthrough the swirling mist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It looks like old times,\" said Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Smells like \\'em,\" Katie amended; \"only I\\'ve been away from these\\r\\nplaces for awhile an\\' I notice that, new place or old, the faces\\r\\nchange pretty quick.  Who\\'s the woman in red, with the yellow hair,\\r\\nCarrie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pointed to a figure spinning about the center of the room, her\\r\\ncrimson skirt flying far behind her like the trail of a comet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know her,\" said Carrie.  \"A year ago she came to New York from the\\r\\ncountry to find work.  When she was about starved, she rang a bell\\r\\nunder the sign \\'Helping Hand Home\\'--she didn\\'t know what that meant\\r\\nexcept that it meant charity.  The superintendent told her his place\\r\\ncouldn\\'t do anything for her; she might be spoiled by associating\\r\\nwith the people he helped; his mission was for bad women that were\\r\\nsorry; not for good women that hadn\\'t anything to be sorry about.\\r\\n\\'But I\\'m hungry,\\' she told him.  \\'Can\\'t help it,\\' he said; \\'you\\'re\\r\\nnot qualified.\\'  This girl went away, and came back a month later.\\r\\n\\'I don\\'t want to come in just yet,\\' she said; \\'but I do want to tell\\r\\nyou that I\\'m qualified now\\'--and she was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie took the facts for what, amid surroundings where such facts are\\r\\nplentiful, they seemed worth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hard luck,\" she said, though not without meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and look at her clothes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the trouble,\" said Katie; \"we can\\'t help lookin\\' at them--the\\r\\nlikes of us--any more than she can help wearin\\' them.  It\\'s that or a\\r\\ntenement with two dark rooms an\\' the rent raised every year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey danced, for among the soberer men there were many that knew\\r\\nthem, and neither girl remembered the weariness of her work in the\\r\\nexhaustion of her dancing.  Between dances, in the dressing-room,\\r\\nthey talked with their acquaintances among the girls, gossiping of\\r\\nthe men and the other women, and now and then, their throats dry and\\r\\ntheir faces streaming, they were taken into the dingy side-bar and\\r\\nwere bought a glass of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs midnight drew closer the dance became more stormy.  Many of the\\r\\nworking-girls went home, and their places were filled by women of the\\r\\nbrighter dressed class.  There were some that were plainly drunk, and\\r\\nthese clumsily imitated the suggestive contortions of the salaried\\r\\ndancers now sent upon the floor to stimulate the amateurs.  One girl,\\r\\nin a cleared space surrounded by laughing men and envious, though\\r\\napparently scornful, women, performed a dance popularly supposed to\\r\\nbe forbidden by the police.  There were several fights, and in one\\r\\nespecially nasty scuffle a lad was badly cut by the knife of a\\r\\njealous partner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess that\\'s about plenty for us,\" observed Katie, as she and\\r\\nCarrie shouldered their way from the crowd surrounding the wounded\\r\\nboy and his shrieking assailant.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth girls were sufficiently familiar with such episodes to accept\\r\\nthem with calm, but both were at last tired out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you\\'re right,\" Carrie assented, \"though I did have a good\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' it was you didn\\'t want to come!\" grinned Katie as they went out\\r\\nupon the cool street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know.\"  Carrie\\'s round face grew hard and puzzled.  \"I know,\" she\\r\\nadmitted, \"only sometimes----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Och, come on, an\\' cheer up!  We must write our letter for the\\r\\nbrewery-man before we get to bed, Carrie-girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did write it, but Carrie, when she had gone into her own room\\r\\nfor the last night she was to spend there, sat for some time\\r\\nmotionless upon the edge of the cot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" she repeated as if to some invisible confessor; \"I know\\r\\nboth sides of it, and, honestly, I don\\'t know which is worse.  I know\\r\\nall that can be said, only--sometimes--I wonder----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nJAIL-DELIVERY\\r\\n\\r\\nRose was ill--she had been drinking too much for the past week--and\\r\\nViolet, in her no longer fresh red kimona, was in the kitchen talking\\r\\nto Cassie when, one morning, the new driver of the brewery-wagon\\r\\nstopped at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Morning,\" he said with what at once struck Violet, who was now\\r\\nconstantly on the watch, as a visible effort at nonchalance.\\r\\n\\r\\nConrad Schultz was a tall, raw-boned German-American, with a long\\r\\nnose and pale, sorrowful mustache, but with an eye in the cerulean\\r\\ndepths of which there lurked the cold fire of reliable strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in,\" said Violet, \"an\\' have a drop of something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came in cumbersomely, and took an uneasy seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some chilly for this season,\" he remarked, with a cool glance in the\\r\\ndirection of the ebony Cassie, hovering glumly in the background.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet thought she caught the meaning of the man, whom she knew was\\r\\nHermann Hoffmann\\'s successor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is chilly for this time of year,\" she said.  \"What will you have?\\r\\nIt better be something warming.  There\\'s whiskey here, or, if you\\r\\ndon\\'t mind waiting till Cassie goes for it, there\\'s some good brandy\\r\\nin the cellar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSchultz appeared to hesitate, and Violet, watching him, could not,\\r\\nfor a moment, decide whether there was, after all, any foundation for\\r\\nthe hope that his appearance had wakened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if it ain\\'t no trouble,\" he at last blurted, \"I would like a\\r\\ntaste of real brandy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cassie,\" said Violet, \"bring up a fresh bottle of brandy for\\r\\nMr.--Mr.----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Schultz,\" prompted that individual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For Mr. Schultz, Cassie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCassie, however, seemed to have scented surrounding mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah reckon there\\'s a bottle som\\'ares about yhere, Miss Vi\\'let,\" she\\r\\ndemurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, there isn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Miss Vi\\'let, there was one jes\\' half empty las\\' night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Rose took that to bed with her.  Don\\'t talk so much.  Go down\\r\\nan\\' get a fresh bottle for Mr. Schultz.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl left the room slowly and sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchultz sat silent and motionless until a moment had followed the\\r\\nclosing of the door.  Then the cold flame was relighted in his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She called you Miss Violet?\" he asked, though still in the most\\r\\ncommonplace of tones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s my name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever talk to the man that had my job before I had it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, with the catlike quiet and ease that always characterized her\\r\\nmovements, stepped to the door through which Cassie had just passed.\\r\\nShe flung it quickly open.  The black girl nearly fell headlong into\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout an instant\\'s hesitation, Violet did the one effective thing.\\r\\nShe smacked the negress smartly across the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard you!\" she said, in tones that were all the more\\r\\nawe-inspiring because they were low.  \"What do you mean by spying on\\r\\nme, you black devil?  Think I want to cheat the house?  I\\'d not be so\\r\\nclumsy about it, if I did!  Think I\\'m trying to skidoo?  I\\'d walk out\\r\\nif I felt like it!  I\\'ll go right to Miss Rose about this, an\\' have\\r\\nyou fired so quick you won\\'t have time to pack your duds!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant remained as she had sprawled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please don\\', miss!\" she wailed.  \"Please don\\' tell Miss Rose!\\r\\nAh wasn\\'t tryin\\' to spy on youse.  Ah jes\\' drapped somethin\\' yhere,\\r\\nan\\' ah was jes\\' tryin\\' to fin\\'----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you lie to me,\" said Violet, her cheeks, now always so wan in\\r\\nthe morning light, flushing to something like their former color.\\r\\n\"Get up off your knees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Vi\\'let, please don\\' tell on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black girl\\'s voice threatened to rise to a dangerous wail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Violet, quickly.  \"I\\'ll let it go this time; but\\r\\nyou hurry up and get that brandy, or I might change my mind.  Pull\\r\\nthe cork while you\\'re at it, and fetch a decent glass from the\\r\\ndining-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCassie, murmuring thanks with her thick lips, and wiping her eyes\\r\\nwith the big knuckles of her right fist, scrambled to her feet, and\\r\\nstarted again upon her errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time Violet left the door open.  She waited till the servant was\\r\\nout of earshot.  Then she opened the door to the back stairway, which\\r\\nshe herself had twice used to excellent purpose, and, finding nobody\\r\\nthere, returned to Schultz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Got something for me?\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no haste upon her part would speed his Teutonic caution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I asked you,\" he said, as if he had not observed the little\\r\\nencounter through which he had sat serene and unconcerned, \"whether\\r\\nyou knew the man who had my job before what I had it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes--yes, I knew him.  Quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your name is Miss Violet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You heard the girl call me that.  Can\\'t you hustle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to hustle.  If you\\'re the girl I want, you\\'ve kept me\\r\\nwaitin\\' here three mornings already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m the person all right.  You know that now.  Oh, won\\'t you\\r\\nplease hurry?  Don\\'t you see how things are here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I seen enough to make me want to go slow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re going slow all right.  What more do you want to know?  I\\r\\ntalked to the man you\\'re telling me about and he said he\\'d see what\\r\\nhe could do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer replies came with the rapidity of musketry, but Schultz spoke\\r\\nwith stubborn deliberation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was that all he told you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothin\\' more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.--Can\\'t you hurry?  Can\\'t you believe me?--He didn\\'t say no\\r\\nmore.--Quick!--Oh, yes, he said he\\'d talk to his girl Katie about\\r\\nme.--Quick!--Hush-t!  Here she comes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCassie\\'s step sounded only a few yards away, but Schultz, now\\r\\napparently satisfied of Violet\\'s identity, displayed an unlooked for\\r\\nspeed.  The heavy hand that had been clumsily reposing in the bulging\\r\\nside-pocket of his coat shot free.  Violet seized a fist that opened\\r\\nand withdrew as her own fingers closed on a bit of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassie entered to find them the width of the kitchen apart.  Violet\\r\\nwas pouring herself a drink of whiskey into a soiled glass, and, if\\r\\nher hand trembled, the silk swathed back that was presented to the\\r\\nservant hid all tokens of nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited until Schultz had slowly drunk his brandy.  She waited to\\r\\nexchange a few more words and to see him go.  She even waited a\\r\\nlittle longer in order not to make her retreat too patently hurried\\r\\nand in order to subdue by threats and cajolery whatever suspicions\\r\\nmight still be lingering in the black breast of the apparently\\r\\npenitent Cassie.  But at last she made her way to her own room and\\r\\nunrolled the bit of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a letter dated from Katie\\'s address four days previous to the\\r\\nday of its receipt, and it was couched in stiff and formal\\r\\nphraseology.  She read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss VIOLET,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Dear Miss Violet--_\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is to inform you that I am Miss Katie Flanagan, particular\\r\\nfriend of Mr. Hermann Hoffmann, who used to drive the brewery-wagon\\r\\nthat left beer at your house.  He told me about you and what you\\r\\nwant, and I told a lady friend, Miss Carrie Berkowicz, who is coming\\r\\nto live with me.  I have just got into a small job and Carrie has\\r\\njust got out of one, and we don\\'t know of none yet for you, but we\\'ll\\r\\nkeep looking and sure will find one, and meantime we want you to come\\r\\nhere and stop with us just as soon as you can beat it from that place\\r\\nwhere you are.  Don\\'t you lose your nerve, and don\\'t bother to talk\\r\\nabout things when you get here, because we know how it is.  You\\r\\nneedn\\'t worry about how we feel, we have too many friends who had the\\r\\nsame bad luck as you, and least said soonest mended, we think.  So\\r\\ncome right here first chance you get and stay as long as you like,\\r\\nand if we\\'re not home when you get here sit on the step till we do\\r\\nget home, and if anybody asks any questions just say you\\'re a friend\\r\\nof ours, because you are, and that\\'s none of their business anyhow,\\r\\nand nobody won\\'t bother you any more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now keep your head cool and God bless you with best wishes!\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"From your friend\\r\\n          \"MISS KATIE FLANAGAN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout daring to lessen her courage by giving way to the feelings\\r\\nthat this letter stirred, Violet read it twice, tore off the address,\\r\\nconcealed it in one of the \"rats\" on which the structure of her\\r\\nrusset hair was founded, and then tore the rest of the epistle into\\r\\nsmall bits, which she flung out of the narrow space between the\\r\\nriveted shutters of her room.  She was now almost ready to strike.\\r\\nIn her captivity, she had, after the first shock, made it her\\r\\nbusiness to learn what she could of those about her.  She knew that\\r\\nWesley Dyker had once been what was called a straw-bail man, an agent\\r\\nwho, for a high consideration, provided bogus bail for such women as\\r\\nthe police, to keep up appearances, were forced from time to time to\\r\\narrest.  She had been told that he was wont, for a still higher\\r\\nconsideration, to appear at court for these clients, in the rôle of a\\r\\ndefender of the wronged poor, and in a very different rôle in their\\r\\nbehalf with the dispensers of justice to the underworld.  She had\\r\\ngathered that his friendship with one political faction aided in\\r\\nsecuring Rose the chance to purchase that expensive police-protection\\r\\ntoward which Angel, unknown to Dyker, assisted Rose through an\\r\\nopposing faction.  And she believed that his ambition was now to gain\\r\\na magistracy from which he could grant bail on bonds signed by his\\r\\nown servants, secure for prisoners the legal service of men that\\r\\nwould return him a commission, and pronounce judgment or dispense\\r\\nmercy for the furtherance of his own fortune and the strengthening of\\r\\nhis own power.  Out of these threads of knowledge Violet resolved to\\r\\nweave the net in which to catch freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon Evelyn informed her that Rose was still abed and had\\r\\nsent for her favorite, Wanda, to console her.  This meant that she\\r\\nwould not descend to the ground floor or be visible to any visitors\\r\\nbefore the next evening, and that the Englishwoman, promoted to\\r\\ntemporary command, would have to pass the night in that reception of\\r\\ncallers which necessitated the appearance of drinking much and the\\r\\nfact of drinking almost nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She does that every time she goes on a bust, my dear,\" complained\\r\\nEvelyn.  \"Of course she jolly well knows that she can trust me and\\r\\nthat I have some manners too, but I wish she would remember that I\\r\\nalso have a thirst and can\\'t do without my drop of real liquor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s nerves tingled.  With her best effort to bury all signs of\\r\\nher mounting hope, she ventured:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could help you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, my dear?\"  Evelyn\\'s eyebrows raised and her contralto voice\\r\\nfollowed them.  \"Catch the madam letting anyone but me take charge!\\r\\nYou know you\\'re none of you allowed down in the front hall unless\\r\\nyou\\'re sent for.  Things are ticklish enough, thank you, with that\\r\\nnew girl upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was almost the first mention that had been made to Violet of the\\r\\nlatest captive since the recent day of Evelyn\\'s exposition of the\\r\\nentire traffic.  Violet had not dared to ask any more questions than\\r\\nthose that she deemed necessary for the perfection of her own plans,\\r\\nand she dared ask none now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do hate the job,\" Evelyn was continuing, \"even if it does mean a\\r\\nfew bits extra.  Rose says that fellow Dyker is due to-night.  She\\'s\\r\\nnot fit to see him above all men, and he\\'s the one I most\\r\\nparticularly hate to meet, because he was a friend of my friend the\\r\\ndoctor and used to call with him now and again at my flat.  I always\\r\\nfancy he\\'s making comparisons under those narsty low lids of his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, in sudden reaction, felt choking with despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could see him,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Evelyn\\'s honors sat heavily upon their possessor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re not a trusty yet, my dear, by any manner of means,\" she\\r\\nresponded.  \"No, no; you will go to your own room after dinner and\\r\\nstay there till you are wanted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tilted her sharp chin and strolled kitchenward for a drink; but,\\r\\nthough she left behind Her a Violet discouraged, it was not a Violet\\r\\nbeaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the girl made her own opportunity.  Noticing that evening\\r\\nthat Evelyn took up a dignified position in the parlor and had Cassie\\r\\nconduct all the guests thither, Violet quickly disposed of the first\\r\\nperson that claimed her attention, and, having made her best\\r\\ntoilet--having restored her cheeks to a resemblance of their pristine\\r\\nglow, coiffed her russet hair, and donned her best of linen--she\\r\\ndescended quietly to the first landing on the stairway, there to take\\r\\nup her watch.  Before she was again in demand, she saw the servant\\r\\nadmit Wesley Dyker.  She ran quickly downward and, just as Cassie\\r\\nstepped forward to precede him, brushed by him in the rosy twilight\\r\\nof the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask to see me,\" she whispered.  \"Ask to see Violet.  Don\\'t let on I\\r\\ntold you.  I\\'ve heard something you want to know about O\\'Malley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the man\\'s shadowy figure could come to pause, she had passed\\r\\nhim and caught up to Cassie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where have you been?\" she asked.  \"I\\'ve been calling for you for\\r\\nfive minutes.  I need some more water in my room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned and reascended the stairs, but her door had not long been\\r\\nclosed before the servant was knocking upon the panel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s you\\' water, Miss Vi\\'let,\" said Cassie.  \"An\\' Miste\\' Dyker\\r\\nwants fer to see you daown in de back parlor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet took the useless pitcher, made sure that the remnant of\\r\\nKatie\\'s note was secure in its hiding-place, and hurried, with Cassie\\r\\nfollowing, to the garish room in which Dyker was awaiting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seated on the lazy, pillowed sofa on which Violet had fallen\\r\\nasleep so soon after her arrival in this house.  He was in\\r\\nevening-clothes that served him, on the East Side, much as the\\r\\nadvertised portraits of certain patent-medicine makers serve their\\r\\nproprietors, the flaccid whiteness of his face still bearing traces\\r\\nof past beauty, the weakness of his mouth hidden by his crisp, short,\\r\\nbrown mustache, and his heavy lids concealing the secret of his\\r\\nsteel-gray eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe half rose as she entered, but she motioned him to sit still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" she said, with the easy manner of the house, which always\\r\\nseemed to presuppose a previous acquaintance.  \"Have you ordered\\r\\nanything?  I\\'m terribly dry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took her hand and caught her meaning,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So am I, Miss Violet,\" he answered.  \"Let\\'s have something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet turned to the servant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cassie,\" she said, \"bring up a couple of bottles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited for the door to close, and then sat down beside Dyker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak low,\" she cautioned.  \"That girl will listen if she can.\\r\\nYou\\'ll have to pretend to be making love to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker regarded her with smiling approval.  Her blue eyes shone with\\r\\nexcitement and red blood fought through the rouge on cheek and fully\\r\\nripe mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask will be both easy and pleasant,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; none of that.  This is no time for bluffing.  Put your arm\\r\\naround my shoulder.  That way.  Now then, you heard what I told you\\r\\nin the hall?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker, with his type\\'s disinclination to take seriously anything that\\r\\nany woman has to say upon serious matters, smiled assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seem to have been doing some listening yourself,\" he said, as\\r\\nhis lingers tightened unnecessarily upon her shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I did, and it\\'s lucky for you I did it.  Will you promise not\\r\\nto give me away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not even to Miss Rose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not even to Rosie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I help you, will you do me a favor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To look at you I should say that I\\'d do you any favor you asked, and\\r\\ndo it without expecting anything in return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis pale lips were curled in a half-scoffing smile, but Violet\\'s next\\r\\nwords brushed from his flaccid face all traces of amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You remember that night you told Miss Rose about what you wanted to\\r\\nget at the next election?  You said you were afraid of O\\'Malley\\r\\ngiving you the double cross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker stiffened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you hear that?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush!  Keep your voice down, or I won\\'t tell you nothing of what I\\r\\nknow.  Remember you\\'re supposed to be making love to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, all right; but I want an answer to my question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, of course, I heard it.  I was at the keyhole\\r\\nthere--that\\'s why I want you to whisper now.--And I heard more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait a minute.  You\\'ll do me a favor if I tell you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything,\" he smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this is business.  If I tell you something that it\\'s worth your\\r\\nwhile to know, will you promise not to blow on me to Miss Rose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And to do something more that I\\'ll ask you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley was now certain that he must not stick at promises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then sit tight.  I don\\'t know as much about O\\'Malley as I pretended\\r\\nout there in the hall, but I do know about Miss Rose.  I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhether O\\'Malley is goin\\' to double-cross you or not, but I do know\\r\\nthat Miss Rose has given you the double-cross already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had thought that passion played a large part in his relations\\r\\nwith her mistress, and she had counted upon awakening his jealousy.\\r\\nWhat, however, had far exceeded his affection was a poor pride of\\r\\npossession, and when Violet\\'s words, in addition to touching his\\r\\nambition, struck at that pride, they aroused an anger that was far\\r\\nmore dangerous than any sense of love betrayed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo red beacons flashed into his pale checks, and his heavy lids,\\r\\nshooting upward for a single instant, disclosed hard, gray eyes gone\\r\\nhot and malevolent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be careful.  Speak low, I tell you,\" she cautioned; \"and remember\\r\\nyour promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s Cassie!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey waited while the black opened the champagne and filled the\\r\\nglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet brushed Dyker\\'s hair over his eyes and laughed at the effect.\\r\\nDyker caught the offending hand and kissed it by way of punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cassie,\" he banteringly asked, \"why didn\\'t you ever tell me there\\r\\nwas such a nice little girl in this house?  I had to get the news\\r\\nfrom a friend on the outside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tossed the now grinning negress a dollar and, as soon as she had\\r\\nleft them, dropped the farce as promptly as did Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say I can\\'t believe you,\" he resumed, the two spots of anger still\\r\\nglowering in his cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet knew that her whole hope rested upon her ability to force\\r\\nconviction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got to believe me,\" she said.  \"I\\'ll tell you all that you\\r\\ntold Miss Rose till I had to run away, that evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did it, omitting scarcely a particular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, ain\\'t it?\" she concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May be.  But what does that prove?  It only shows that you heard me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows that I can hear Miss Rose when she talks to somebody else.\\r\\nAnd I did hear her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whom was she talking to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man you asked her about.  To Rafael Angelelli.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but I told her to talk to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' she did it.  But the first time I heard her was just before you\\r\\ntold her to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That same night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was in the kitchen with her when you came in.  Why, he\\'s here all\\r\\nthe time!  I don\\'t care what she pretends to you, she\\'s stuck on him,\\r\\nan\\' every girl in the house knows it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRapidly, but as fully as she had sketched the dialogue between Rose\\r\\nand Dyker, she now described the first conversation that she had\\r\\noverheard between her mistress and the Italian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d come down to graft a drink,\" she said, \"an\\' I heard them from\\r\\nthe stairs.  That\\'s how, after he\\'d left, I came to listen to you\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker had quailed under the revelation, thus made to him, of\\r\\npolitical danger.  He now quivered in anger at the comments upon\\r\\nhimself, somewhat colored, that Violet had placed in the mouths of\\r\\nRose and Angel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll find out about this!\" he said, struggling against the desperate\\r\\narms flung swiftly around him to keep him on the sofa.  \"Let me go!\\r\\nBy God, I\\'ll have that drunken cat down here and squeeze the truth\\r\\nout of her throat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the caution, all the craft, all that she had counted upon as the\\r\\nreal Wesley Dyker seemed to have escaped him.  His voice was still\\r\\nlow, but in every other respect he was a raging beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fought with him, mentally and physically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t get anything out of her that way,\" Violet urged, as the\\r\\nman twisted under her strong hands.  \"Of course she\\'ll say it\\'s all\\r\\nlies.  And you\\'d only be warning her.  You don\\'t want her to know\\r\\nthat you know; you want a chance to block her game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly convinced by this argument and partly subdued by the physical\\r\\nrestraint that accompanied it, Dyker ceased his struggles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I want to be sure,\" he muttered sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t be sure by goin\\' to Miss Rose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I ought to tell her.\"  The high tide of his anger was slowly\\r\\nsubsiding, and the rocky Dyker that she had built on was beginning to\\r\\nshow its crest above the still hissing waves.  \"Look here, Violet,\"\\r\\nhe said, \"I\\'m sorry I behaved like such a fool.  I beg your pardon,\\r\\nbut you must see that I have got to put this thing up to Rose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You forget your promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t, but I must make sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet thought rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen,\" she said; \"I told you I wanted you to do something for me\\r\\nan\\' you gave your word you\\'d do it.--Will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I will, only I\\'m thinking a little about myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will help you, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet drew a long breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want you to go over to the avenue right away,\" she said, \"and buy\\r\\nme a long cloak and a hat and bring them back, and then take me out\\r\\nof here without a word to anybody.  You needn\\'t walk more\\'n three\\r\\nsquares with me, an\\' then I won\\'t bother you no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker drew away and whistled softly.  His face grew quite composed\\r\\nagain.  The heavy lids fell over his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that\\'s it, is it?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to get away,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so you\\'ve cooked up this little mess of lies to make me the\\r\\ngoat, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet felt the sands slipping beneath her feet.  She laced her\\r\\nfingers together till the knuckles bruised her flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t do that,\" she pleaded; \"don\\'t take it that way; it\\'s true,\\r\\nwhat I told you, every word of it.  I only want you to keep your\\r\\npromise to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped with a sob, and waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley reached calmly for a glass of wine, drank it, put down the\\r\\nglass, thrust his hands deep into his trousers\\' pockets, and,\\r\\nstretching out his long legs, regarded, humming, the toes of his\\r\\nshining pumps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe you,\" he said at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Mr. Dyker----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s too thin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even if it was a lie,\" Violet despairingly persisted, \"you ought to\\r\\nhelp me.  Do you know who I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know how I was brought here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was tricked.  The man said he wanted to marry me.  I didn\\'t know.\\r\\nI believed him.  An\\' they beat me an\\' starved me and did things I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t think about an\\' couldn\\'t help thinkin\\' about.  An\\' all I\\r\\nwant is just for you to do me this one little favor.  I won\\'t bother\\r\\nyou.  I won\\'t blow on you----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you know I wouldn\\'t blow on you!  I couldn\\'t.  I want to forget\\r\\nthe whole thing.  I\\'ve got friends to go to who\\'ll get me work.  I\\r\\nonly want you to get me out of the door and safe away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most men of his sort Dyker, although ready enough to make a\\r\\nliving out of the results of cruelty, hated the sight of cruelty\\'s\\r\\nself.  The girl\\'s words touched, though lightly, his selfish heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can\\'t afford to help you,\" he protested.  \"You see how I\\'m\\r\\ntied up here.  I can\\'t have Rose jump on me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know she\\'s jumping on you already.  You know she\\'s knifing you\\r\\nin the back.  The only way you can stop her is by using what I\\'ve\\r\\ntold you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" said Dyker in the tone of a man thinking aloud, \"if she\\r\\nreally was playing both ends against the middle, I could pull her\\r\\nteeth by going straight to O\\'Malley and telling him so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet did not wholly understand this, but she agreed immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you could,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I suppose I could have her pinched then, if you\\'d testify\\r\\nagainst her.  Would you do that?  Would you go into court?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s fingers closed spasmodically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just give me the chanc\\'t,\" she said fervently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of course there are other girls who\\'ve been in the same scrape\\r\\nhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a new one upstairs this minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is?  Um.  That\\'s good.\"  He rattled the money in his pocket.\\r\\n\"Only, look here,\" he persisted, \"if you have been telling the truth,\\r\\nit will probably make me solid with O\\'Malley, but if you haven\\'t,\\r\\nI\\'ll go clean to smash.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet saw the turn of affairs and, with hope\\'s revival, her mind\\r\\ncleared immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I haven\\'t told you all,\" she said, \"and I guess the rest will make\\r\\nyou sure enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s more then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you help me out of here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you convince me.--Let\\'s see; the shops around here are still\\r\\nopen.--Yes, if you convince me, you\\'ll be out of here in half an\\r\\nhour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was her only chance.  She did not hesitate.  She told him the\\r\\nwhole of what she had heard of the later assuring interview between\\r\\nRose and Angelelli.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time he listened quietly, his face inscrutable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That all?\" he asked when she had ended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the truth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t I sayin\\' it proof that it\\'s true?  How could I make it up?  I\\r\\ndon\\'t know all that it means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You knew enough to pass it on to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lucky for you I did, too; but I don\\'t know all it means--how could\\r\\nI?--and you do know, an\\' that ought to be proof enough that it\\'s\\r\\nGod\\'s truth, Mr. Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped.  Her case was with the jury.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cassie!\" he called.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet leaped to her feet and laid her hands on his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you goin\\' to do?\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe silenced her with a gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you want,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassie put her black head in at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cassie,\" he continued, flipping the maid another dollar, \"I\\'m a\\r\\nlittle off my feed.  I\\'m going to the drugstore on the corner and get\\r\\nfixed up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Miste\\' Dyker.--Ah kin go fer you, Miste\\' Dyker,\" said the\\r\\nnegress.  \"Thank you, sah.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thanks, Cassie, I can go myself; I want the air.  But you can do\\r\\nsomething else for me.  You can just not let this girl run away from\\r\\nme.  I know she would run if she could, but I like her too well to\\r\\nlet her, so if anybody wants her, just you say she\\'s in here and\\r\\nengaged for the evening by me.  I\\'ll be back in fifteen minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left one door as the willingly assenting Cassie closed the other,\\r\\nand Violet flung herself on the sofa and buried her face in the\\r\\ncushions, now fearful that the servant, notwithstanding their\\r\\nprecautions, had overheard her, now afraid that Dyker would change\\r\\nhis purpose and fail to return, and again dreading that he might\\r\\nbetray her to Rose.  Since the night she had waited for Max to\\r\\ntelephone in the café, since the terrible morning that had followed,\\r\\nit was the longest quarter of an hour that she had known, but it at\\r\\nlast dragged its quivering length away.  The doorbell rang.  Cassie\\r\\npassed through the room to find Violet sitting suddenly upright, and\\r\\nat once returned with Dyker, his summer raincoat tossed across his\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the servant left them, he lifted the coat.  Below it, not wrapped\\r\\nin the paper usual to a new purchase, was a dark cloak.  He unrolled\\r\\nit, uncovered a beaver hat, and handed them both to the panting\\r\\nViolet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here you are,\" he said quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seized them and began to put them on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he cautioned, \"on second thought, I guess I\\'d better carry\\r\\nthem.  The parlor door\\'s open, and Evelyn and Fritzie are in there\\r\\nwith a couple of men.  I\\'ll go ahead and open the vestibule door and\\r\\nthe front door.  Then you come by as if you were going upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Evelyn\\'ll come out to see if I have any money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'ll never learn that, though here, by the way, is a ten-dollar\\r\\nbill that will come in handy.--The doors will be open and I\\'ll be on\\r\\nthe pavement.  Keep only a yard behind me.  Riley\\'s at the other end\\r\\nof his beat, and I have a cab at the curb.  Ready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not speak, but she nodded her russet head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed before her up the rosy twilight of the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, following, her lips tight, her breathing suspended, her heart\\r\\npounding against her breast, was dimly aware of her own soft\\r\\nfootfalls sounding hideously loud, of the blast of light and laughter\\r\\nfrom the parlor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker flung wide the vestibule door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night!\" he called to Evelyn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going?  Good-night!\" Violet heard the Englishwoman answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe heard Evelyn rise.  She heard the front door open.  She saw\\r\\nWesley raise his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hurried by the parlor door, and then, instead of turning to the\\r\\nstairs, gathered up her red kimona and ran through the vestibule,\\r\\nthrough a patch of soft, fresh darkness, and was tossed precipitately\\r\\ninto a cab into which Dyker followed her just as the horse, under a\\r\\nquick blow, dashed madly up the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the open cab-window the night air beat upon her fevered face.  She\\r\\ndrank it deep into her thirsting lungs.  It was the wine of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nRIVINGTON STREET\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eastern end of Rivington Street is a hectic thoroughfare.  Often\\r\\nit is so hectic as to be no thoroughfare at all, but only a tossing\\r\\nfever-dream, a whirling phantasmagoria of noisy shadows, grotesque\\r\\nand reasonless.  It seems a street with a bad conscience, for it\\r\\nnever sleeps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dawn, even in summertime, hesitates long before it comes\\r\\nshivering up from the crowded East River to drop a few grudged rays\\r\\nof anæmic light on Rivington Street.  Already, out of the humming\\r\\ncourts, the black alleys, and the foul passages that feed this avenue\\r\\nas gutters feed a sewer, a long funeral procession of little\\r\\nhandcarts has groped its way and taken a mournful stand beside the\\r\\nfetid curbs; and soon, pausing at these carts to buy the rank morsels\\r\\nof breakfast that there is never time to eat at home, the gray army\\r\\nof the workers begins to scurry westward.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst come the market-laborers, with shoulders bowed and muscles\\r\\ncramped from the bearing of many burdens.  Upon their heels march the\\r\\npale conscripts of the sweatshops, their hands shaking, their cheeks\\r\\nsunken, their eyes hot from loss of sleep.  Follow the sad-lipped\\r\\nfactory-girls, women before their time, old women before their youth,\\r\\nand then the long line of predestined shop-clerks, most of them still\\r\\nin short skirts and all of them, befittingly, in mourning-black.\\r\\nSwiftly they go, the whole corps of them, the whole corps strangely\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe street is not emptied of them before it is filled again, now by\\r\\nsolemn children on their way to school, children whose gaze is fixed,\\r\\nwhose mouths are maturely set, and whose voices, when they are heard\\r\\nat all, are high, strident, nervous.  As these go by, the shops begin\\r\\nto do business: the cheap food-shops, the old-clothes shops, the\\r\\nshops that sell second-hand five-cent novels for a copper, and the\\r\\npawnbrokers\\'.  The shawl-hooded housewives clutter in and out,\\r\\nselling first that they may buy afterward, and continuing like ants\\r\\nswarming about an ant-hill until noon strikes and the children parade\\r\\nstolidly away from school for luncheon, and back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that hour the underworld of Rivington Street enough recovers from\\r\\nits drunkenness of the night preceding to stagger forth and drink\\r\\nagain.  The doors of the shouldering saloons swing open and bang shut\\r\\nin a running accompaniment, and the highway rocks with it until a\\r\\ncloud of clattering two-wheeled push-carts swoops from \"The Push-Cart\\r\\nGarage\" around the corner and alights as if it were a plague of\\r\\npestilent flies.  Bearded Jews propel these, Jews with shining\\r\\nderbies far back upon their heads, who work sometimes for themselves,\\r\\nbut more often for the owners of the push-cart trust, who squabble\\r\\nfor positions in the gutter where an impotent law forbids any of them\\r\\nlong to remain, but where, once entrenched, they stand for hours,\\r\\nselling stockings at five cents and shirts at ten, mirrors and\\r\\nvegetables, suspenders and lithographs, shoestrings and\\r\\npicture-postcards, collars of linen and celluloid, all sorts of cheap\\r\\ndress-material, every description of brush, fruit, and cigar-butts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carts are end-to-end now; one could walk upon them from\\r\\ncross-street to cross-street.  Each has its separate gasoline torch\\r\\nleaping up, in flame and smoke, to the descending darkness.  Upon\\r\\nthem charge the returning army of workers.  The crowd is all moving\\r\\neastward; you could not make six yards of progress to the west; the\\r\\nsidewalks overflow, the street is filled.  The silence of the morning\\r\\nhas changed to a mad chorus of discords.  The thousand weary feet\\r\\nshuffle, the venders shriek their wares; there is every imaginable\\r\\nsound of strife and traffic, but there is no distinguishable note of\\r\\nmirth.  Wagons jostle pedestrians, graze children, are blocked, held\\r\\nup, turned away.  The thoroughfare is like a boiling cauldron; it can\\r\\nhold no more, and still it must hold more and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly very slowly, as the night wears on, do the crowd and noise\\r\\nlessen; but at last, by tardy degrees, they do lessen.\\r\\nImperceptibly, but inevitably, even this portion of New York breathes\\r\\nsomewhat easier.  By twos and threes the people melt away; a note at\\r\\na time, the cries weaken and the shuffling dies; and finally, in the\\r\\nsmall hours of the morning, Rivington Street turns over, with a\\r\\ntroubled sigh, to a restless doze.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to doze only.  Its bad conscience will grant it no absolute\\r\\noblivion, no perfect rest, however brief.  Cats yell from the dizzy\\r\\nedges of the lower roofs; dogs howl from the doorsteps.  Back in the\\r\\nnarrow courts and alleys and passages, drunken battles are won and\\r\\nlost.  The elevated cars roar out the minutes through the nocturnal\\r\\ndistances.  An ambulance clangs into a byway street.  A patrol-wagon\\r\\nclatters past.  Rivington Street turns and tosses on its hot couch,\\r\\nand through its dreams slink hideous shadows that dare not show\\r\\nthemselves by day.  One, ten, a hundred, each alone, they come and\\r\\ngo: vague, inhuman.  And then, reluctantly, the hesitant dawn creeps\\r\\nshivering out of the East River, and the weary day begins again.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto this street--into its noisiest quarter at its noisiest time--the\\r\\ncab that bore Violet on her way to liberty at last turned and\\r\\nproceeded as far under the flaring gasoline torches as the evening\\r\\ncrowd of workers, buyers, and sellers, would permit.  The girl,\\r\\nthrough the dark thoroughfares that had preceded it, had answered a\\r\\nscore of questions, which Dyker had asked her, the fever of escape\\r\\nbeating high in her breast and tossing ready replies to her heated\\r\\nlips; but now, in the roar and brilliance of Rivington Street\\'s\\r\\nnocturnal traffic, there had come upon her a terror almost equal to\\r\\nthat which had assailed her when, with Max for her guide, the lighted\\r\\nlength of East Fourteenth Street had first unrolled itself before\\r\\nher.  The city was again an inimical monster awaiting her descent\\r\\nfrom the cab, and the newly acquired habit of seclusion, the habit of\\r\\nthe prisoner, recoiled upon her.  Freedom was strange; it became\\r\\nawesome, and when the horse was stopped and Violet knew that she must\\r\\nsoon fare alone, she cowered in a corner, breathing hard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t go no furder, boss,\" said the cabby, leaning far around from\\r\\nhis seat.  \"Where to now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nowhere right away,\" answered Dyker.  \"Just stand where you are for\\r\\na minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he turned to Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" he said, not unkindly, \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to drop you here.\\r\\nIt wouldn\\'t do for me to figure publicly as an active agent in this\\r\\ncase, you know.  But you needn\\'t worry.  Just get out and walk to the\\r\\nnext corner.  Turn to your right, take the next cross-street to your\\r\\nleft, go up the first narrow street you come to, and your friend\\'s\\r\\nhouse ought to be about the third in the row.  It will be a little\\r\\ndark, but you won\\'t have any trouble finding it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope I won\\'t,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely not.  If you have, just ask the way of the first policeman\\r\\nyou see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a policeman, Mr. Dyker!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, a policeman.  He won\\'t hurt you as long as you keep your\\r\\ncloak tight.  Now, you\\'re sure you\\'ve given me the right address?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I gave you the one the man gave me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I mean you\\'re not lying to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s wide eyes should have been sufficient denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why would I do that?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so; only I thought--well, I beg your pardon, Violet.  You\\r\\nhave my office-address on that card.  I\\'ll send for you in a day or\\r\\ntwo--be sure to be home every afternoon--and then we\\'ll fix Madame\\r\\nRose with the District-Attorney.--Good-by.  Sure you\\'re not afraid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer gratitude would not permit her to acknowledge fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not afraid,\" she smiled, rather grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then remember: the first street to your right, the next to your\\r\\nleft, and then to your right again--third or fourth house in the row.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened the cab-door and alighted, holding out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe straightened her beaver hat, drew the folds of her dark cloak\\r\\ntightly over the betraying crimson of her kimona, and, helped by his\\r\\ngrasp, followed him to the swarming curb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I don\\'t know how to thank you,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then don\\'t try,\" returned Dyker, laughing easily.  \"You can make it\\r\\nall right with me when you testify against Rose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe kept his hand a moment longer, partly in fear of the human\\r\\nmultitude about her and partly in genuine gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I do thank you,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker, not too well liking the white light of publicity in which this\\r\\nlittle scene was being enacted, pressed her hand and dropped it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" he responded.  \"Just don\\'t forget your promise.\"\\r\\nHe stepped back into the cab.  \"Good-by, and good luck,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-by,\" he heard her answer, and then, with his head out of the\\r\\ncab-window, he saw her pause bewilderedly.  \"To your right,\" he\\r\\ncautioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe watched her turn.  He saw her plunge into the crowd.  He saw the\\r\\ncrowd swallow her up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take me over to my office,\" he ordered the driver, and added his\\r\\naddress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there, he dismissed the cab, climbed the steps of what seemed an\\r\\nold and modest little house, and, opening the door and turning into\\r\\nthe front room, lit a gas-jet the flame of which revealed an\\r\\napartment surprisingly new and arrogant.  The walls were lined with\\r\\nnew bookcases holding rows of new law-books, and surrounded by rows\\r\\nof new chairs.  The flat-top desk in the center, at which his\\r\\nstenographer sat by daylight, was a new desk, with new wire-baskets\\r\\nupon it, and a new telephone, to which Dyker now immediately\\r\\nproceeded and called a number.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello,\" he said into the transmitter, adopting the low tone that he\\r\\nalways used in his wired conversations.  \"Is that Schleger\\'s?--It\\r\\nis?--That you, Ludwig?--This is Dyker.--Yes, good-evening,\\r\\nLudwig.--Yes, pretty good, thank you.  How are you, and how\\'s\\r\\nbusiness?--That\\'s good.  Mrs. Schleger and the babies all\\r\\nright?--I\\'ll bet that boy\\'s gained three pounds!--He has?  I\\'m glad\\r\\nto hear it.  You\\'re a wonder.--Yes.--That\\'s what I said.  And, say,\\r\\nLudwig, is O\\'Malley anywhere around?--He isn\\'t?--Hasn\\'t been in this\\r\\nevening?--Oh!  Well, I wonder where I can find him.--You don\\'t?\\r\\nPerhaps he\\'s at Dugan\\'s place.--No, it\\'s not anything important: I\\r\\njust wanted to take a drink with him, that\\'s all.  He\\'s sure to be at\\r\\nDugan\\'s or Venturio\\'s, but I guess I won\\'t bother.  Ever so much\\r\\nobliged, Ludwig.--Good-by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of his word, Dyker did, however, bother.  He called three\\r\\nother numbers in his quest of the political boss, and when he found\\r\\nhim, the underling made a pressing appointment for an important\\r\\nconference on the next morning, though what it was that he wanted\\r\\nthen to discuss he carefully neglected to mention over a\\r\\ntelephone-wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hung up the receiver in a glow of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now,\" he said, \"I think I\\'ll get away for the night.  I don\\'t\\r\\ncare to have any arguments with Rose for a day or two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, even as he said it, the telephone-bell uttered its staccato\\r\\nsummons.  He stood uncertainly beside the desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She wouldn\\'t have the nerve to use the wire,\" he argued.  \"Perhaps\\r\\nit\\'s O\\'Malley with more to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the bell rang, and his curiosity overcame his caution.  He took\\r\\nup the receiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" he said sharply, and then his tone mellowed, for the voice\\r\\nthat came to him across the hurrying New York night was the voice of\\r\\nMarian Lennox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that Mr. Dyker\\'s office?\" it asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the head of the firm himself,\" he answered, \"and mighty glad\\r\\nto hear from you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you\\'re glad,\" the voice pursued, \"because I want to ask a\\r\\nfavor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is as good as performed.  What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been down town, and remained longer than I intended, and I\\r\\nwant you, please, to take me home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought you were asking a favor, not bestowing one.  Where are\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the settlement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Rivington Street?\"  Wesley set his teeth as he asked it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, I\\'ll be over right away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rang off and left the office.  He was sorry that he had dismissed\\r\\nthe cab, for he expected to need it when he reached the first stage\\r\\nof his journey; but the way was not long to the place that Marian had\\r\\nnamed, and, even had it been twice as far to the settlement, Dyker,\\r\\nwho walked thither with the feet of chagrin, would not have remarked\\r\\nthe distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of Rivington Street, in a house that used, long ago, to\\r\\nbe a Methodist parsonage, a little group of devoted women are doing\\r\\ntheir best to redeem, by social activities, the people of the\\r\\nneighborhood from the benighted condition in which the people\\'s lot\\r\\nis cast.  This best has now been done for more years than a few, and\\r\\nthe people, still considering it necessary to remain alive, and still\\r\\nknowing that to remain alive they must submit to the economic system\\r\\nimposed upon them, continue discouragingly unredeemed.  But the\\r\\ndevoted women, though they neglect the disease for its symptoms,\\r\\npersist as only feminine natures can persist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are college-bred women with the limitations and emancipations of\\r\\ntheir class; and they have a great deal to occupy their attention\\r\\nbesides their essays in social entertainment.  For the most part they\\r\\npass their days in really practical investigation.  One of them will\\r\\ninspect the public schools and impartially consider curricula and\\r\\nventilation.  Another will visit tenements and ask housewives\\r\\npersonal questions for the tabular benefit of the Russell Sage\\r\\nFoundation.  A third goes into the laundries of the best hotels and\\r\\nfinds that these hostelries force their washerwomen to sleep twenty\\r\\nin a room.  Yet, when they return to Rivington Street, these daylight\\r\\ninvestigators spur their wearied nerves to further exertion and go\\r\\nforward, not to teach the toilers the practical cause and remedy of\\r\\nthe economic evil, but to form the boys and girls, the young women\\r\\nand young men, into reading groups, debating clubs, sewing circles,\\r\\ncooking classes, and elocutionary juntas.  Their zeal is boundless,\\r\\ntheir martyrdom sadly genuine, and, if there is humor, there is\\r\\nsomething more than humor in their ultimate complaint:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of our people we retain, but most of them slip away, and, even\\r\\nwith the best of fortune, we seem, somehow, able to do so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker knew the place by reputation.  He had always scorned it for its\\r\\nown sake, and now he had come to hate it for Marian\\'s.  For want of a\\r\\nbetter term, it may be repeated that he was in love with Marian.\\r\\nMoreover, he wished the assistance that an early marriage with the\\r\\ndaughter of a wealthy department-store owner would give him in the\\r\\ncoming campaign.  And, finally, his peculiar legal activities were\\r\\nalready well enough known on the East Side to make it probable that\\r\\nany young woman entering the settlement would speedily learn of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the night of the opera his cooler reflection had rejected\\r\\nMarian\\'s plan of joining the Rivington Street colony as a fervently\\r\\ngirlish dream destined to fade before the reality of action.  He had\\r\\ndecided that the best way to aid its dissipation was no longer to\\r\\ncombat it, and he had even, during the months that had followed, seen\\r\\nMarian but rarely, and never alone.  Occupied with politics and\\r\\nknowing the tactical value of restraint, he had not so much as\\r\\npressed his wooing.  He had relied upon what he chose to describe as\\r\\nhis sweetheart\\'s basic commonsense to work out their common\\r\\nsalvation, and had decided that, this commonsense being what he\\r\\nesteemed it, Marian was a woman more likely to be won by a Fabian\\r\\ncampaign than by a Varric attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point wherein these calculations erred was their underestimation\\r\\nof the momentum of a girlish impulse.  That method of consideration\\r\\nwhich makes one slow to reach convictions works beyond the\\r\\nconvictions and retards one from action upon them, once they are\\r\\nachieved, but the impulsive mind that bolts a creed unmasticated\\r\\nstraightway drives its owner, in the creed\\'s behalf, to the\\r\\nthumbscrews or the wrack.  It is from the pods of half-baked opinions\\r\\nthat there is shaken the seed of the church: Marian meant to keep to\\r\\nher purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Wesley\\'s silence and the subtle sense of pique that it\\r\\nawakened played a part in this; perhaps the purpose was\\r\\nself-sufficient; but, in either case, Marian missed scarcely an\\r\\nevening at the settlement.  Two of her former classmates were\\r\\nknee-deep in the work there, and what she saw and what they told her\\r\\nserved only to confirm her.  It thus happened that, anxious again to\\r\\nsee him alone, and more anxious to let him know the endurance of her\\r\\nresolution, she had, on this evening, telephoned on the chance of\\r\\nfinding him late at his office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" he gasped as she met him at the settlement\\'s door.\\r\\n\"What on earth are you doing in this part of town at this hour of the\\r\\nnight?  Let me \\'phone for a taxi.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat, as a matter of fact, she had been doing was to listen to slim\\r\\nlittle Luigi Malatesta and fat little Morris Binderwitz respectively\\r\\nattacking and defending the proposition that Abraham Lincoln was a\\r\\ngreater American than George Washington; but what she thought she had\\r\\nbeen doing was assisting in raising the lower half of society.  Under\\r\\nthis impression, her fine brown eyes shone with the consciousness of\\r\\nmoral rectitude, her mouth was even more than usually firm, and her\\r\\nhead even more than usually like some delicate cameo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One thing at a time, please,\" she imperturbably answered.  \"First,\\r\\nno taxicab.  It isn\\'t far to Second Avenue, which is quiet enough,\\r\\nand I want to walk for a few blocks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the arm that he grimly offered, and he began to break his\\r\\nway through the noisy crowd under the flaring gasoline lamps of the\\r\\npush-carts.  Coherent conversation was at first impossible, but Dyker\\r\\nfelt a glow of pride as, with her fingers closed in tight trust upon\\r\\nhim, he shouldered a passage for her, and Marian herself was not\\r\\ninsusceptible to the thrill inherent in the situation.  Nevertheless,\\r\\nthe girl, as soon as they had turned northward, reverted to her\\r\\nformer attitude; and the man, knowing well that all this meant that\\r\\nshe was still determined upon a course necessarily delaying his\\r\\nwooing and perhaps resulting in his discovery, frankly resumed his\\r\\nopposition.  He did more and worse: he swept aside all his method of\\r\\nsilence, all his plans of conquest through non-resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" he said, continuing their interrupted talk, \"I should really\\r\\nlike to know what you, of all people in the world, were doing on\\r\\nRivington Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was there,\" she announced serenely, \"because I have made up my\\r\\nmind that it is I, of all people in the world, who ought to be there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marian,\"--he almost stopped as he said it--\"are you really in\\r\\nearnest about this fancy?  Do you honestly mean that you are\\r\\nseriously considering any such chimerical course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had, naturally, chosen precisely the tone that, were any\\r\\nadditional incentive required, would have compelled her to\\r\\nresolution.  Her mind, as it chanced, was, however, made up, and what\\r\\nhe now said served only to turn her toward that feminine logic which\\r\\nassumes as done that which is determined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am past consideration,\" she said.  \"I have already virtually\\r\\nbegun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marian!  You\\'re joking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am simply stating a fact.  Why do you suppose I have been staying\\r\\nin town this summer?  I begin my real work at the settlement with the\\r\\nfirst of next week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer classmates in Rivington Street, could they have heard this, would\\r\\nhave been pleased, but they would also have been surprised.\\r\\nNevertheless, she at once mentally decided to make good her\\r\\ndeclaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the darkness Dyker bit the lip that, under his short, crisp\\r\\nmustache, trembled with vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You really mean that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bowed a brief assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what, if you please, do you propose to do when you get there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to that Marian found herself suddenly certain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ought to know,\" she said, \"how these people are living; you\\r\\nought to know how the girls--hundreds and hundreds of them--are every\\r\\nweek going into lives of shame and death.  I mean to do what I can to\\r\\nstop them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been a hard thing for her to say to him had he not\\r\\nwrought upon her anger, and had not the freshness of her partial\\r\\nglimpse of earth\\'s lower seven-eighths fired her heart with a blind\\r\\ninspiration.  She had the partial vision that makes the martyr: a\\r\\nvision that shows just enough of an evil to confirm the necessity of\\r\\naction and not enough to prove how little individual action\\r\\nindividually directed can be worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second time Wesley gasped.  Here were depths in her of which\\r\\nhe had not dreamed, and because he had not dreamed of them he would\\r\\nnot admit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you can\\'t!\" he protested.  \"It is impossible that you should.\\r\\nIt\\'s inconceivable that a woman of your delicacy should go into such\\r\\ncoarse work!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it better that it should be left to coarse women?  It seems to me\\r\\nthat there has been enough of coarseness in it already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this--why, it\\'s something that one can\\'t even speak about!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, something that we are not permitted even to mention, Wesley;\\r\\nand because we aren\\'t permitted even to mention it, the thing grows\\r\\nand grows, night by night.  It thrives in the shadow of our silence.\\r\\nThey tell me that the liquor laws are broken, because nobody will\\r\\nmention it; that bestial men get rich in it, because nobody will\\r\\nmention it; that in this city alone there are three hundred saloon\\r\\ndance-halls intended to furnish its supply, because nobody will\\r\\nmention it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFiguratively, Dyker threw up his hands in horror, but actually, like\\r\\nall desperate men, he seized at the straws of detail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, that just shows how wrong your view of the whole subject\\r\\nhappens to be,\" he declared.  \"My work has put me in a position to\\r\\nknow something about these dance-halls, and I know that they exist\\r\\nsimply because the girls that go to them want them to exist--the\\r\\ngirls, mark you; not the men.  Why, the girls aren\\'t taken to such\\r\\nplaces; they go of themselves, they pay their own admission, and it\\r\\nis the usual thing for a girl earning six dollars a week in a store\\r\\nto save fifty cents out of every salary-envelope for the dance-halls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you want me to conclude that the fact that they want to do the\\r\\nthing makes the thing right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t understand----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely; and so I mean to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t learn.  No matter how closely you study this whole matter,\\r\\nyou can\\'t learn, Marian.  How can a clean-hearted, clean-lived\\r\\nAmerican girl ever get the point of view of these low-down,\\r\\nlow-browed foreigners?  It\\'s the sort of thing they\\'re used to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before they begin it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the survival of the fittest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then can\\'t some be made more fit to survive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the law of life, and it can\\'t be stopped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So was negro slavery the law of life.  It couldn\\'t be stopped\\r\\neither--until we stopped it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all theory, Marian; it won\\'t work out in practice.  The\\r\\ngreat point is that these unfortunate women, whether they become\\r\\nunfortunate through the dance-halls or anywhere else, are simply not\\r\\nour sort of clay: they\\'re not Americans.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are human beings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A pretty low example.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are more Americans than your ancestors or mine were three\\r\\nhundred years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense.  They\\'re different, I tell you--different.  Seriously, I\\r\\nknow what I am talking about: I speak from systematic investigations,\\r\\nreports, statistics.  The very latest investigation shows that all\\r\\nbut about thirteen per cent. of these women were either born abroad\\r\\nor else are the children of foreign parents.  It is always the newest\\r\\nimmigrants that swell the ranks, and of course the newest immigrants\\r\\nare our lowest type.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see that all this alters the question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lower they are, the more plainly it is our duty to raise them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Marian, how can you raise them when you don\\'t understand\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian shook her handsome head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You _will_ come back to that,\" she said; \"and all that I can answer\\r\\nis that, not being utterly stupid, and having come to understand a\\r\\nfew abstract problems, I have hopes of mastering something so close\\r\\nat hand to me and so concrete as a fellow human being.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, for instance?\" asked Wesley, \"can you understand of the\\r\\ntypical Jewish girl of the East Side?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A good deal, I think.  They were talking about that type at the\\r\\nsettlement this evening.  We were looking from the front windows at\\r\\nan endless stream of Jewish girls tramping home from the factories\\r\\nwhere they worked to the tenements where they slept.  Somebody said\\r\\nthere are nearly four hundred thousand Jews living east of the\\r\\nBowery; that in most Jewish families the ambition to which every\\r\\ncomfort must be sacrificed is the education of the boys; that for\\r\\nthis reason the girls must work and are worked until there is nowhere\\r\\nelse in the world where so much labor is got out of young women, and\\r\\nyet that the Jewess that is not married and a mother before she is\\r\\ntwenty is regarded as a family disgrace.  It seems to me, Wesley,\\r\\nthat the case of those girls is pretty easy to understand.  It seems\\r\\nto me that they are on the horns of a rather ugly dilemma.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker\\'s cane whipped the air as if it were striking at the heads of\\r\\nopposing arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You accept as gospel,\" he said, \"everything that is told you by\\r\\nanybody but me.  It isn\\'t a pleasant subject, but, if you insist upon\\r\\nfacts, let me tell you that there are troops of Jewesses who come\\r\\ndown here from the upper Ghetto and walk the streets for no other\\r\\npurpose than to get money for their wedding trousseaus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a blow at her conventions, and she shuddered; but she stood by\\r\\nher guns.  They had crossed down Twenty-sixth Street now and they\\r\\nturned into the quiet of Madison Avenue, among comfortable houses and\\r\\nsilent churches, as she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they do that,\" she said, \"it is because they have to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have to?  Why on earth should they have to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, but I know that the very use they make of the money\\r\\nshows what they do is only a means and not an end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are trousseaus so necessary that these girls have to sell their\\r\\nsouls for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Souls have been sold for less.  Even you and I make considerable\\r\\nsacrifices for things that other people in other classes would not\\r\\nthink needful at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had done his best to bridle his annoyance, but now he could bridle\\r\\nit no longer.  He was wholly sincere in his inability to take\\r\\nseriously either the girl or her point of view, and now, though he\\r\\nfelt as if he were riding a hunter at a butterfly, he charged blindly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please don\\'t let us jump at sentiment and theory,\" he\\r\\nremonstrated; \"let us keep our feet on figures and fact.  The figures\\r\\ngrow with the population; they always have so grown and they always\\r\\nwill so grow.  And the plain fact is that, though a few good people\\r\\nhave been trying to stop this thing for four thousand years, they\\r\\nhave never succeeded in doing anything but soiling themselves in the\\r\\nattempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that,\" she frankly acknowledged, \"and I don\\'t know what it is\\r\\nthat\\'s to blame; but I know that there isn\\'t any evil that hasn\\'t\\r\\nsome cure if we can only find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why not leave the search for a cure to the experienced?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall; but I propose to become one of the experienced.  I mean to\\r\\ngive my time, at least for a while, to first-hand study.  Perhaps\\r\\nthen I shall learn enough to know that it\\'s useless for me to go on,\\r\\nbut I shall keep trying to go on until I am convinced that there\\r\\nisn\\'t any use in the trying.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s absurd, Marian--simply absurd.  The condition is, after all,\\r\\none that must be dealt with by the law, and I tell you honestly that,\\r\\nas yet, even the law is helpless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has the law really tried?  Has it ever attempted, for instance, to\\r\\ndo anything to the men that take these immigrant girls at the dock\\r\\nand make slaves of them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it has; it has tried just that.  In Chicago two men were\\r\\narrested for taking a couple of such girls--they had brought them\\r\\nfrom New York--and when the case was appealed, the United States\\r\\nSupreme Court found that, though importation of girls was a violation\\r\\nof federal law, yet the federal law providing a punishment for merely\\r\\n_harboring_ such girls after their arrival was unconstitutional.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian\\'s voice faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is--is that true?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absolutely,\" said Dyker.  Like most lawyers of his generation, his\\r\\nideas of what was right were limited only by the final decisions of\\r\\nwhat was legal, and if the Supreme Court of the United States had, by\\r\\neven a majority of one, declared that the sun moved around the earth,\\r\\nDyker would have first denied and then forgotten all previous\\r\\nastronomy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absolutely,\" he repeated, and awaited her capitulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Marian did not capitulate.  She merely drew a long breath and\\r\\nanswered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, that, of course, is just a small portion of the big\\r\\nquestion, and the only way it moves me is to lessen my opinion of the\\r\\nSupreme Court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Wesley\\'s turn to gasp, and he did so.  He had always suspected\\r\\nthat these college-settlements were hotbeds of Socialism and\\r\\nAnarchy--two theories that, to Dyker, were one and the same--and now\\r\\nhe had his confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was too cynically wrong upon one side of their subject to realize\\r\\nhow emotionally wrong she, in her hope of accomplishment through\\r\\npersonal appeal, might be upon the other.  But here was a concrete\\r\\ndenial of his one sincere conviction, and, though he was at last calm\\r\\nenough to see that he must not allow this conviction to wreck his\\r\\nsuit, he was not so calm as to maintain a clear judgment.  It was\\r\\nplain that Marian would not be turned from her experiment.  His best\\r\\ncourse was, he then reasoned, immediately to put on record his\\r\\nopinion of its futility, even to quarrel with her in defense of that\\r\\nopinion, and then, when experience brought the awakening upon which\\r\\nhis own worldly experience counted, to stand ready to profit by the\\r\\ninevitable reaction that would most likely show the perfidy of the\\r\\nwomen whom Marian hoped to help, detract from the credibility of any\\r\\ngossip they might recount concerning him, and end by winning him his\\r\\nwife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said sharply, \"it is perfectly useless to talk\\r\\nreasonably to anybody that can take such a view of so simple a\\r\\nmatter.  Here is Thirty-fourth Street.  I think we had better walk\\r\\nover to Broadway and get that taxi.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst thing that a man can impute to a handsome woman is a lack\\r\\nof intellect.  Marian\\'s cheeks flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I quite agree with you,\" she replied.  \"I am utterly incapable of\\r\\narguing with anybody that so confuses law and justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said Dyker; \"but I want you to remember what I have said\\r\\nupon the subject as a whole.  When you have trusted these women and\\r\\nbeen betrayed by them, when they have poisoned your mind against all\\r\\nthe principles you have been brought up to believe, when you have\\r\\nleft the world of sentiment and bruised your poor hands with\\r\\nhammering at the door of fact, then you will acknowledge that I have\\r\\nbeen right.  I am not angry----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, of course not!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not angry, but I am firm.  I only ask you to believe that I\\r\\nshall never be far away from the settlement, and that you have only\\r\\nto telephone for me when you have need of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian compressed her lips to a more severe firmness, and the ride\\r\\nfrom Thirty-fourth Street to Riverside Drive was made in silence; but\\r\\nthe following Monday found her, against all parental protests,\\r\\nenlisted as a settlement-worker in Rivington Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV\\r\\n\\r\\nIMPARTIAL JUSTICE\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael M. O\\'Malley, political boss, held his court, that next\\r\\nmorning, in the back room of Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon on Second\\r\\nAvenue, and, because it was to be a busy day and there were many\\r\\npleas to be made and many petitions to be received, he came early to\\r\\nhis post.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he swung majestically up the street toward his destination, his\\r\\ncarefully pressed light gray suit flapping in the warm breeze about a\\r\\nfigure so tall and so thin that any suit approaching \"a fit\" would\\r\\nhave achieved only a caricature, his progress was almost regal.\\r\\nPedestrians stepped to one side as if the bulk of his unseen dignity\\r\\ndemanded a far wider strip of the paved channel than was required by\\r\\nhis visible physique.  Workingmen touched their grimy caps, the\\r\\noverseers of the street-repairing gangs bowed respectfully, children\\r\\non their way to school bobbed their heads, and, at a corner, Officer\\r\\nRiley, concluding a substitute week \"on the day turn,\" offered his\\r\\nbest military salute.  The keeper of every news-stand received a nod;\\r\\nthe bootblacks outside of each saloon were given a brief word of\\r\\ngreeting; there was not a beggar but got some largess, and of the\\r\\nseveral men that hurried up with a request, hinted or expressed, all\\r\\nwere permitted to walk a few steps in the august presence, all\\r\\nreceived a brief, civil phrase of agreement, postponement, or\\r\\nconsideration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Trouble about your place?\"  It was thus that O\\'Malley interrupted\\r\\nthe voluble plea of a saloon-keeper that approached him.  \"I\\'ll have\\r\\nthat cop, Conners, looked into.  His eyes are too new; they see\\r\\nmore\\'n they\\'re paid to see.  Who\\'s tendin\\' day-bar for you?  Johnny\\r\\nMager?  All right, if they take the thing up front, I\\'ll see that you\\r\\nget your license transferred in his name.  Keep your shirt on an\\'\\r\\nleave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not paused in his walk; he had not raised his quiet voice or\\r\\nquickened his slow speech; but the suppliant retired satisfied,\\r\\nreassured.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, O\\'Malley\\'s face was one that, if it would not inspire\\r\\nconfidence in a stranger unacquainted with the man\\'s reputation for\\r\\nguarding the interests of his dependents, at least bore the\\r\\nunmistakable stamp of that knowledge of life which is power.  It was\\r\\nsallow and long, with a long thin nose and long thin lips, and cold\\r\\neyes that thrust as swiftly and as deeply as the stilettos of Mr.\\r\\nO\\'Malley\\'s Italian constituents.  He smiled often and his smile was\\r\\nbitter; he spoke little and his words were short; but his servants\\r\\nhad early learned that he was as sure to keep his promise as he was\\r\\nready to give it, and that, so long as his tasks were well done, he\\r\\nwas an indulgent master.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe entered \"Schleger\\'s place\" with the air of an owner, nodded to the\\r\\nwhite-jacketed man behind the polished counter and before the\\r\\npolished mirror, and gave a quick, firm pressure to the plump,\\r\\noutstretched hand of the fat and grinning proprietor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All well with the family?\" he asked, smiling his wry smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nLudwig Schleger beamed assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything doing last night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothin\\',\" replied Ludwig.  \"\\'Ceptin\\' Mr. Dyker called you on the\\r\\ntelephone.  Wouldn\\'t say what he wanted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that.  Haven\\'t had any more roughhousing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" grinned Schleger, wisely; \"the boys are all got wise that they\\r\\ncan\\'t meddle with my new night-man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see.  Name\\'s Hermann Hoffmann, ain\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum.  Well, he may be useful.  You must get him to move into this\\r\\nprecinct, or else register him from here.  Votes right, of course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t asked him yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do it to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley walked to the dimly lighted back-room, hung with racing\\r\\nprints and framed lithographs advertising a wide variety of whiskeys.\\r\\nHe drew a wicker-bottomed chair to a stained round table, and sat\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proprietor brought him a glass and a syphon of seltzer--the\\r\\nboss\\'s only drink--and disappeared.  The bar-keeper came with a\\r\\nhandful of black cigars for which O\\'Malley paid with a bill, refusing\\r\\nthe change, and also disappeared.  Then the door of communication was\\r\\nshut and guarded, admission being denied to all persons not properly\\r\\naccredited, and the quiet, thin man in the light gray suit, now\\r\\nsipping his seltzer, now reflectively adjusting his bright blue tie,\\r\\nwhich bore a brilliant diamond pin, and always slowly smoking, began\\r\\nhis conference with such callers as he had granted appointments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came in force--alone and in groups--all manner of men by the\\r\\nmain entrance and a woman or two ushered through a side door.  This\\r\\none was promised a reward for duty to be done, that one assigned to\\r\\nthe performance of a delicate piece of diplomacy.  Now and then a\\r\\nshort, sharp, cold reprimand for negligence or failure sent away a\\r\\ncaller whipped, penitent, trembling; and here and there release was\\r\\npromised for a wayward son sent to \"The Island,\" or a line of credit\\r\\nwritten for use at a grocer\\'s shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley Dyker came early.  He paused at the bar for a drink to stiffen\\r\\nhis courage, lingered a little longer until a predecessor had been\\r\\ndismissed, and then, his lids lowered, entered, alone, with a\\r\\nsuccinct account of Rose\\'s attempt to play a double game.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had finished the narrative, O\\'Malley sat for a while gazing\\r\\nunconcernedly at the blackened ceiling, and smoking quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\" he said at last, and turned the sharp thrust of his gaze upon\\r\\nhis caller.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker, who was sitting opposite and who had been served with a drink\\r\\nof whiskey, tossed off the liquor in order to gain time to muster an\\r\\nanswer for this unexpected query.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he at length replied, annoyed at thus being put into a\\r\\nposition where he must make his proposition in the form of a request,\\r\\n\"are you going to stand for that sort of thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dunno.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_ wouldn\\'t stand for it,\" said Dyker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had my job you might have to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another pause.  The long fingers of O\\'Malley tapped gently\\r\\non the table.  Dyker shifted uneasily in his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t stand for it a minute!\" he at last broke forth.  \"And\\r\\nwhat\\'s more, you can have her up for something worse than the\\r\\ndisorderly-house charge.  She has one kidnapped girl in her house\\r\\nnow, and I\\'ve got another that escaped from her, and who\\'s ready to\\r\\ntestify.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn instant later he was sorry that he had spoken so readily.\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley tilted back against the wall until the front legs of his\\r\\nchair rose six inches from the floor.  He blew an easy ring of smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seem to have come here with your case all prepared,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley flushed and stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see,\" he began, \"I mean that I got hot at this, and I said to\\r\\nmyself that it was only right to let you know this woman wasn\\'t to be\\r\\ndepended upon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forward legs of O\\'Malley\\'s chair came down with a loud thump.\\r\\nWesley started, but the boss only impaled him with another cold\\r\\nglance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here,\" said he, \"before we can do business we\\'d better\\r\\naltogether understand each other.  Just what is it you want?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I think I\\'ve made that clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_ think not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want this Légère woman pinched for running a white-slave place.  I\\r\\nwant to see her taught a lesson that the other women down her way\\r\\nwill profit by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you do.  But what do you want for yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue was too conclusively joined to permit of further evasion.\\r\\nWesley took his courage in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I\\'ve not made any secret of that,\" he said, \"and neither has\\r\\nheadquarters.  I want the next election for magistrate.  I told you\\r\\nthat long ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe launched his declaration with the bravado of weakness at bay, and\\r\\nthen breathlessly awaited the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael O\\'Malley leaned back again in his chair, clasped his hands\\r\\nbehind his head, and closed his keen eyes, reflecting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis was an hereditary office, but, unlike most men that inherit\\r\\npower, he had inherited also the abilities that had gained the power.\\r\\nHis father, who had begun life as a policeman, had been a great\\r\\nexemplar of the political uses of an element fully realized only by\\r\\nthe expert politician: the human element.  The name of O\\'Malley had\\r\\nnow for a generation been, south of Fourteenth Street, a magic title.\\r\\nTo a legion of men, women, and children, it stood for a sort of\\r\\nsubstitute, and very near and practical, Providence.  It implied\\r\\ncontact, fellow-feeling, the personal relation.  Acting upon the\\r\\npolitician\\'s axiom that whatever is acquired is right, the elder\\r\\nO\\'Malley had risen from the street force until, after zealous\\r\\nparty-work, he had been promoted, in the palmy days of policy and the\\r\\npool-rooms, to the \"Gambling Squad,\" where he had performed the\\r\\nastounding financial feat of saving eight times his monthly salary,\\r\\nhad retired, and grown annually richer and stronger through politics,\\r\\nwithout once losing the esteem of his voting underlings, or once\\r\\nseeming to cease being one of them.  Since his father\\'s death, now\\r\\nthat gambling had declined and prostitution had risen as political\\r\\nmaterial, Michael, who had been brought up to the business, had\\r\\nfilled the place of that genuinely mourned parent.  Without any\\r\\npublicly acknowledged means of support, even with no headquarters\\r\\nsave the daily shifted back-rooms of saloons, he had extended and\\r\\nincreased the power and the fortune that had been left to him.  He\\r\\nwas known as the friend of the distressed; he was recognized as\\r\\nbenefiting with his left hand the poor whom he unimpededly robbed\\r\\nwith his right.  To those who were without money or without\\r\\nassistance he was always accessible.  He made festival with the merry\\r\\nand was readily sympathetic with them that mourned.  By small gifts\\r\\nat all times and large gifts in days of emergency, by acting as the\\r\\nadviser, the employment-agent, the defender, from the law, of the\\r\\npeople whom he exploited and upon whose weaknesses and vices he\\r\\nthrove, he won and held fast both the tribute and the allegiance of\\r\\nthe vicious and the weak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a mighty position and yet one that, in moments like the\\r\\npresent, was inherently delicate, one in which the fortunate man must\\r\\nmove warily lest in gaining a new friend he lose an old.  It is all\\r\\nvery well to be temperate and profit by drunkenness, to be abstemious\\r\\nand take money from prostitution; it is easy to give presents at\\r\\nChristmas and picnics in summer when the giving is in reality only\\r\\npaying a small rebate to wives for drunken husbands, to mothers for\\r\\ndaughters stolen.  It is easy to find a place in the municipal\\r\\ngovernment for the man that stuffs a ballot-box for you, or the\\r\\nprocurer that registers your fraudulent votes from the houses of his\\r\\ncustomers; but it is fatal to punish, for what may be a passing\\r\\ndisloyalty, anyone that your world, perhaps ignorant that offense has\\r\\nbeen committed, regards as having been placed by a careless Heaven\\r\\nunder your protecting wing,--fatal, that is to say, unless you\\r\\nacquire something more than you throw away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all this, though scarcely with such frankness of phrase, Michael\\r\\nO\\'Malley made thought before he gave Dyker the reply for which that\\r\\nclever young lawyer was waiting.  Behind his closed eyes he weighed\\r\\nthe chances carefully: the things to be gained against the things\\r\\nthat might be lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he thoughtfully lit another black cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got to keep out of personal relations with these women,\" he\\r\\nyawned.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker bit his lip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t have them,\" he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, you do.  Cut \\'em out.  Understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSurprisedly, angrily, Dyker found himself bowing obedience, like a\\r\\nschool-urchin detected in some breach of academic discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A woman with a past,\" continued O\\'Malley, \"is all right for the\\r\\npresent, but a slow mare in the futurity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you\\'re correct,\" said Wesley Dyker.  With a single blow\\r\\nof the whip, the master had demonstrated his mastery.\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley smoked a while longer in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then,\" he at last pursued, \"about this magistracy.  You think\\r\\nthe boys\\'ll stand for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think they will,\" Wesley replied, with humble mien, but rising\\r\\nassurance.  \"And I think it ought to make the ticket look better to\\r\\nthe uptown people to have--if you will pardon my saying so--my sort\\r\\nof name on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you worry about the looks of the ticket, or the value of your\\r\\nsort of a name,\" he said.  \"The kid-glove game is played out; it\\'s\\r\\nonly the monkey who\\'s always hopping about on his family-tree.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker\\'s courage ebbed again, but he knew that to stand upon his\\r\\ndignity was to be overthrown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At all events,\" he persisted, \"I am pretty well known hereabouts by\\r\\nthis time, and I think honestly that I am pretty well liked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley nodded.  He knew more about that than Dyker knew.  Dyker\\r\\nhad, with more or less direct assistance from O\\'Malley\\'s own\\r\\nheadquarters, already won some prominence for himself, and had been\\r\\nof some use to the organization, in that sort of legal-practice which\\r\\nis a highly specialized branch of the profession on the lower East\\r\\nSide.  The purpose of that branch is simply the protection of the\\r\\ncriminal, especially the criminal engaged in the procuring or\\r\\nconfining of slave-girls, but its methods, far from being unusual,\\r\\nare merely a daring extension of the methods that, within the last\\r\\ndecade, have increased in popularity among the seemingly more\\r\\nrespectable practitioners.  Evidence is manufactured or destroyed,\\r\\naccording to immediate needs; favorable witnesses are taught\\r\\nfavorable testimony; postponements are secured until a politically\\r\\nindebted judge is on the bench.  There follows a formal bellowing\\r\\nagainst what are called invasions of inalienable personal rights, and\\r\\nthen there comes a matter-of-course acquittal.  With Dyker\\'s ability\\r\\nin this sort of work O\\'Malley was thoroughly familiar; for this man\\'s\\r\\nparty-services he was sufficiently grateful, and with the chance of\\r\\nthe lawyer\\'s rise to a popularity that would be of still further help\\r\\nhe was well satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'d be elected,\" he at length reflectively remarked, \"you\\'d\\r\\nhave a mighty responsible position, Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There would be a good many ways\"--O\\'Malley knocked, with great\\r\\ndeliberation, the ash from his cigar--\"a good many ways in which you\\r\\ncould help the party--if you\\'d be elected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to be discussing, disinterestedly, a purely abstract\\r\\nquestion; but Dyker did not miss his meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shouldn\\'t overlook them,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, _if you\\'d be elected_, there\\'d be a lot of ways in which you\\r\\nmight hurt--the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I scarcely think you have any just cause for apprehension upon that\\r\\nscore, Mr. O\\'Malley.  I think that my record speaks for itself.  My\\r\\nrecord is regular; it is an open book to the whole city----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind that, Dyker; it\\'s an open book to me, anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m aware of it; but then----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All I want to know is two things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First, are you the kind that lose their head over a good thing and\\r\\nland in jail?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does my law-practice seem to indicate that I should be likely to\\r\\noverstep legal limits?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I guess it don\\'t.  But you can\\'t always tell; we can\\'t afford no\\r\\nhogs; and that sort of a man gives all his friends a black eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I say to you----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And next, I want to know, Mr. Dyker, whether you\\'re the kind of a\\r\\nman that don\\'t forget them that put him where he\\'s at.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe low, slow spoken sentence ended with a sudden click of Mr.\\r\\nO\\'Malley\\'s long, vulpine jaws.  He leaned quickly forward across the\\r\\ntable and fixed Wesley with the stiletto of his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker met that gaze steadily.  He leaned, in his turn, toward\\r\\nO\\'Malley, and his own voice dropped to a whisper.  There was an\\r\\nexchange of a dozen sentences, and the two men had arrived at a\\r\\nperfect understanding: Dyker was as good as elected.\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley pressed the call-button.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billy,\" he said to the bar-keeper, \"have somebody run out and bring\\r\\nin Larry Riley off his beat.  I want to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the bar-keeper nodded and disappeared, Dyker started to rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know whether Riley had better see me here,\" he said.\\r\\n\"Rose\\'s house is on his regular beat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the more reason to sit tight,\" replied the comprehending\\r\\nO\\'Malley.  \"What\\'s the use of gettin\\' square with a person unless the\\r\\nperson knows who done it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am not sure that Riley would be a safe man to confide this to.\\r\\nHe\\'s naturally a friend of Rose\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s more of a friend of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer entered a minute later, his flushed face gravely\\r\\nattentive, his helmet in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Riley,\" said O\\'Malley, \"you know this Légère woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do that, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, she\\'s been gettin\\' too gay.  When you go off duty, you tell\\r\\nJim to have her place pinched to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRiley\\'s cheeks became a shade less red.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s sorry I am to hear, sir, that she\\'s been misbehavin\\' of\\r\\nherself,\" he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure you\\'re sorry.  Tell Jim to get there early: we don\\'t want\\r\\nnobody but the women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\"--Riley wet his dry lips--\"What\\'s the charge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Runnin\\' a white-slave joint.  You\\'re to be sure to get a girl she\\r\\nhas in the third floor back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Malley\\'s tone had been conclusive; it indicated that the interview\\r\\nwas at an end; but the big officer stood twirling his helmet between\\r\\nhis large hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. O\\'Malley, sir?\" he began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, Riley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothin\\' else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nuthin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\'--there ain\\'t no other way out of it for Mrs. Légère?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, there ain\\'t.  But you can report her house and get the credit\\r\\nyourself, Riley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank ye kindly, sir; but if ye don\\'t mind, sir, I think I\\'d rather\\r\\nlet someone get it as nades it more.  Ye see, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir, this\\r\\nhere Mrs. Légère has been powerful kind to me, an\\'----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, have it your own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I can\\'t do nothin\\' for her, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not this time.  That\\'s all, Riley.--And, Riley----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thin boss stood up and crossed to the bulky policeman.  His voice\\r\\nwas still low and soft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yis, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If that woman gets wind of this an\\' makes a getaway, I\\'ll have your\\r\\nuniform off you so God damned quick you\\'ll wish I\\'d skinned you\\r\\nalive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yis, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir,\" said the officer.  \"No fear of that, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he left the audience-chamber with a heavy heart.  He lived the\\r\\nlife that he was compelled to live, and he did what he was ordered to\\r\\ndo, but he could not without compunction turn upon one that had\\r\\nbought a right to his own and his superior\\'s protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not a little silent bitterness in his heart as, later,\\r\\nreturning to the station-house, he thought upon these things.  He\\r\\nremembered the days when he had been new upon the force.  Those were\\r\\nthe days when the popular tide had turned against gambling and, amid\\r\\nthe raids that meant the breaking of steel doors, the pursuit of\\r\\noffenders through secret passages and across steep roofs, it was for\\r\\na while possible for a policeman to retain his ideals.  But he\\r\\nremembered also how, when the ruling powers had thus been forced to\\r\\ndestroy the nests where once they had gathered golden eggs, the long\\r\\narm of necessity swung slowly backward until it paused at the point\\r\\nwhere it had since remained and, because the eggs must be gathered\\r\\nsomewhere, the police were expected to gather them from the aeries of\\r\\nthe vultures that preyed upon women.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiley had not minded, every pay-day, handing over to the appointed\\r\\nheeler the five dollars wherefor he received a receipt for a dollar\\r\\nand a half as dues to the political club to which he was expected to\\r\\nbelong.  For quite some time he had been content with closing his\\r\\neyes to saloons that were opened on Sundays by proprietors that were\\r\\npowerful, and with allowing others to profit by the rewards of his\\r\\nvoluntary blindness.  But at last there came the first baby in the\\r\\nRiley home, and then the second, and the wife\\'s long illness; and\\r\\nthen assessments were increased and, finally, after many a broad hint\\r\\nfrom the men higher up, he was given plainly to understand that he\\r\\nmust either hand over a goodly portion of money, every week, from the\\r\\noffending women on his beat, or else lose his usefulness to the force.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, he took what he must and kept what he could.  He had no\\r\\ntrade on which to fall back; his domestic and political expenses grew\\r\\nannually, and, as an evasion of the former meant financial ruin, so\\r\\nthe shirking of the latter meant a charge lodged at headquarters, a\\r\\nspeedy hearing, and an automatic dismissal.  Even when a non-partisan\\r\\nman was put at the head of the department, that official\\'s practical\\r\\npower was nullified by the fact that the mayor, a party-man, was\\r\\nbehind him and could remove him at a moment\\'s notice, and that behind\\r\\nthe mayor was the organization that had made and could break the\\r\\nmayor.  No individual, so far as Officer Riley could see, was\\r\\npersonally to blame, was himself a free agent; but the whole\\r\\ncollection of individuals were the irresponsible parts of a gigantic\\r\\nmachine--from the inner council of Tammany to their spies in every\\r\\nmunicipal department--which, if ever broken by the recognized party\\r\\nof opposition, must be so thoroughly rebuilt and so precisely\\r\\noperated in accordance with mechanical lines that the change would\\r\\nsignify only the casting out of the irresponsible parts and their\\r\\nreplacement by parts equally irresponsible.  Riley could look no\\r\\nfarther, and, even could he have seen that the remedy must be a\\r\\nremedy of conditions, he could have done nothing to free himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the station-house he delivered the commands that O\\'Malley had\\r\\ngiven him.  There his words produced consternation, but no thought of\\r\\ndisaffection.  The patrol-wagon was ordered to be in its stable,\\r\\nready to leave at the given hour, and Riley, as the officer regularly\\r\\nassigned to night-work on the beat in which stood Rose\\'s house, was\\r\\nforced to remain to accompany it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' see here, you men,\"--these were the words with which the brief\\r\\ninstructions were concluded--\"you see to it nobody gets ahead of you.\\r\\nThis is O\\'Malley\\'s job, an\\' it\\'s got to be done right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the underworld of every city, news, however, travels even while it\\r\\nis in the making, and in no direction does it travel more swiftly,\\r\\njust as in no other does it travel more indirectly, than, when the\\r\\nslave-trade is concerned, it travels to the traders.  Riley was\\r\\ncareful to remain in full view of the sergeant\\'s desk from the moment\\r\\nthe arrangements were made until the time of execution--he would not\\r\\nhave dared to communicate with the friends that had thus swiftly\\r\\nbecome the enemy--none of the wagon-crew were seen to leave the\\r\\nstable, to use the telephone, or to speak to a passerby, and yet,\\r\\nshortly before the appointed time, through a certain club-room over a\\r\\nnot far distant saloon--a club-room much affected by young men in Max\\r\\nGrossman\\'s profession--there soon spread the definite tidings that\\r\\nRosie Légère had just been \"piped off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swarthy and brilliant Rafael Angelelli heard the word, and\\r\\nstraightway, beyond all doubting, confirmed it.  With the unheeded\\r\\neasy evening breeze tumbling his uncovered oily locks, he ran to the\\r\\nnearest booth-telephone, and hurriedly called Rose upon the wire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eet ees comin\\'!\" he whispered excitedly into the transmitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose\\'s voice replied with stolid assurance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s comin\\'?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Poliziotti_--cops,\" replied the Italian, finding more and more\\r\\ndifficulty with his English as his panic increased.  \"Eet ees Angel\\r\\ntalkin\\'.--I jus\\' getta da _nuova_.--They maka da pinch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quit your kiddin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.  _Veraménte.  Crêdi tu!_  Queeck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis fright hit the mark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How\\'d it happen?\" demanded Rose.  \"Who\\'s back of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dees Meest\\' Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You fool Dago\"--her voice grew shrill with fear and anger--\"can\\'t\\r\\nyou do nothin\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.  \\'E\\'s been to O\\'Malley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a hell of a help!  How about Riley an\\' the rest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.  O\\'Malley maka them do thees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s that slut Violet, that\\'s who it is!  That\\'s gratitude for you.\\r\\nI\\'ve been half expectin\\' trouble since she got loose last night.--How\\r\\nlong have I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\' know.  Maybe five min\\'; maybe one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My Gawd!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\' hang up!  Leesten: firs\\' t\\'eeng you do getta da new girl out.\\r\\nEef they getta dees new girl you go----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there came a quick click from the other end of the wire.  Rose\\r\\nhad ended the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel, still hatless, hurried through the few intervening streets and\\r\\ndarted into that street to which he had just been speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready the early New York twilight had descended, and the block\\r\\nseemed, at first glance, to have turned to slumber.  One distant,\\r\\nspluttering arc-light succeeded only in accentuating the gloom.  From\\r\\nthe patch of darkening sky into which the roofs blended, a bare\\r\\nhandful of pale stars twinkled weakly, and on both sides, from corner\\r\\nto corner, the uniform, narrow houses rose in somber repetition, each\\r\\nwith its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each with its shuttered\\r\\nwindows, each silent behind its mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this the Italian saw with accustomed eyes, and then he darted\\r\\ninto the shadow of an areaway, because he saw also that, brief as had\\r\\nbeen his journey, Riley had arrived before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a little knot of wise children, a patrol wagon, its sophisticated\\r\\nhorses unconcernedly dozing, stood before Rose\\'s house.  An officer\\r\\nwas in the doorway; hurried lights shifted from behind one bowed\\r\\nshutter to another, and gradually Angel became conscious that, all\\r\\nalong the street, frightened faces were peeping from stealthily\\r\\nlifted blinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor quite some time the watcher waited.  At last the big figure of\\r\\nRiley and a companion appeared in the open doorway and spoke to\\r\\nsomeone in the wagon.  Through the evening quiet their voices came\\r\\ndistinctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ready?\" asked Riley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All ready,\" came the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got the madam an\\' the nigger, an\\' the four of thim, but I\\r\\nbelave they must have turned the new girl loose before we got here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time the reply came from within the house, and it came in the\\r\\ntones of Rose, raised high in anger and in blasphemy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a dirty liar, Larry Riley!  There never was another one, an\\'\\r\\nyou know that as well as I do!  Just you wait till I tell the judge\\r\\nwhat you do know, you damned, low, double-crossin\\' sneak!  You\\r\\nbastard, you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRiley and his companions turned and ran into the vestibule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just you wait,\" the cry continued.  \"Just you wait, you thief,\\r\\nyou----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice stopped as suddenly as it had started.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another pause, a longer one, and then Angel, bending as far\\r\\nas he dared from his hidden corner, saw the two officers come quickly\\r\\nout with their hands upon the arms of two cloaked women, whom they\\r\\nhelped into the dark recesses of the patrol-wagon.  They went back\\r\\nand returned with one more.  A fourth followed; then a fifth, and a\\r\\nsixth.  Two policemen appeared, evidently from positions that they\\r\\nhad been guarding in the rear of the house.  The man on the steps\\r\\nclosed the door and locked it.  All the policemen climbed to the\\r\\nwagon.  The driver gathered up the reins.  The tittering children\\r\\nscattered wildly.  The horses woke up and started away at a brisk\\r\\ntrot.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpartial Justice was beginning her task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nSANCTUARY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo leave the protection of Dyker and the kindly secrecy of the cab,\\r\\nand then to leap into a tide of alien human beings and swim against\\r\\nthem in a strange and terrifying sea, had required the last grain of\\r\\ncourage and strength that was left in Violet\\'s sapped body and cowed\\r\\nsoul.  It was only by the momentum that Wesley\\'s calm directions had\\r\\ngiven her, and quite without consciousness upon her own part that,\\r\\nwith her cloak gripped tightly about her, she tottered forward,\\r\\nbuffeted and shrinking, to the first corner, wheeled to the right\\r\\ninto a street comfortingly darker, turned again into a still narrower\\r\\nand quieter way, and then came to an uncertain stop before what\\r\\nseemed to be no street at all, but only a small black rift among the\\r\\nbeetling walls of brick.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpty as was the way compared with Rivington Street, it was what, had\\r\\nshe not seen the former thoroughfare, she would have considered\\r\\noppressively full.  Urchins walked hand in hand along the gutters,\\r\\npush-cart men cried their wares over the cobbles and, in the hot\\r\\nnight, frowzy women crowded the house-steps.  A clatter of voices, of\\r\\nforeign tongues and unfamiliar forms of English, rattled out the\\r\\ngossip of the neighborhood, and a few steps away, a belated\\r\\nhurdy-gurdy shook forth a popular tune.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet cowered against the nearest wall.  She was uncertain as to how\\r\\nto proceed, and she was afraid to stand still.  There seized her an\\r\\nunreasoned terror lest all this seeming escape might be some new\\r\\ntrick leading into some new trap.  A policeman passed with heavy\\r\\ntread, but, unmindful of Dyker\\'s assurance, the girl drew, trembling,\\r\\nas far away from him as she could.  Then, when her straining eyes saw\\r\\nhim turn at the next corner to retrace his steps, she made sure that\\r\\nhe was coming back to recapture her, and, now desperate, she faced a\\r\\npair of solemn children slowly approaching from the opposite\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six-year-old boy to whom she especially addressed herself shook\\r\\nan uncomprehending head, but his wiser companion, a very dirty little\\r\\ngirl of seven, made proud answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He don\\'t to speak no English,\" she said.  \"He only can tell things\\r\\nout of Jewish.  But I tells you.  That there\\'s your street right\\r\\nbehind you.  Yiss, ma\\'am.  An\\' your house is by the two on that there\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s lips tried to form a word of thanks.  She turned, as the\\r\\ngirl had ordered, into the rift among the brick walls, found that,\\r\\nonce it had traveled beyond the depth of the house before which she\\r\\nhad been standing, it opened to a width of a few additional feet, and\\r\\nso, almost creeping through the Stygian passage in which shone only\\r\\none far-away lamp, she felt her way to the second door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was partially open, and a jet of blue gas in the hallway burned\\r\\noverhead.  She could see several doors in the shadows, but all were\\r\\nclosed.  She heard a dragging step coming down the stairs.  She drew\\r\\nagainst the wall and waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe step was slow and uncertain.  It seemed to consider well before\\r\\neach movement forward, but it had a character that reassured her.  It\\r\\nwas the same sort of step with which her father was wont to return\\r\\nhome after his occasional carouses, and she knew that whoso walked in\\r\\nthat fashion was, so long as one kept out of reach, not greatly to be\\r\\nfeared.  She remained hidden until the step drew nearer, until the\\r\\ndark bulk of the drunkard slowly massed itself out of the surrounding\\r\\ndarkness, until it had brushed by her.  Then she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you tell me,\" she asked, \"if there\\'s a Miss Flanagan lives here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passerby was not in a condition where voices from nowhere seemed\\r\\nremarkable.  He stopped and, evidently not clear as to just whence\\r\\nthis particular voice proceeded, addressed the air immediately before\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can so,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then will you, please?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will I what?\" responded the passerby, determined that the air should\\r\\nbe more specific.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you please _tell_ me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell you what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there a Miss Flanagan lives here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is that.  There\\'s three of her, an\\' wan of thim\\'s a Missus.\\r\\nGood-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAwkwardly he touched his hat to the air and stumbled out into the\\r\\nalley.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet breathed hard.  She had never in her life before been in a\\r\\ntenement-house; but she knew that now she must seek a door through\\r\\nwhich some ray of light gave hint of waking persons within and,\\r\\nknocking, of them inquire anew.  Around her, all the doors were\\r\\nforbidding, so, timidly and with a hand tight upon the shaking rail,\\r\\nshe softly climbed the decrepit stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the second floor a shaft of yellow light stopped her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was a door that was open, and beyond it, by an uncovered deal\\r\\ntable on which stood a rude kerosene lamp, sat two figures: the\\r\\nfigure of an old woman, her gnarled hands clasped loosely in her\\r\\naproned lap, her dim eyes gazing at the sightless window, and the\\r\\nfigure of a young woman, her hands beneath her round chin, her wide\\r\\neyes on a naked baby quietly sleeping in a clothes-basket at her\\r\\nknee.  The floor was uncarpeted, the walls unadorned, the room almost\\r\\nbare of furniture; but on the face of her that looked into the past\\r\\nand in the face of her that looked into the future there was peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nA quick stroke of pain stabbed the onlooker\\'s heart, but she dragged\\r\\nherself ahead and, not to disturb the baby, spoke without knocking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman turned, and Violet noticed that the eyes which could\\r\\nsee so far behind were blind and could see no step forward.  The\\r\\nmother, however, spoke kindly and gave the directions that the girl\\r\\nneeded; but Violet, wanting to say something about the baby in\\r\\nreturn, and, able only to murmur formal thanks, pursued her climb\\r\\nupward.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found at last the door that she was certain must be Katie\\r\\nFlanagan\\'s, but, when she had found it, all power of further motion\\r\\nsuddenly ceased.  Weakness, shame, and fear swept over her like a\\r\\ncloud of evil gases from an endangered mine, and she swayed against\\r\\nthe panel before her.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside, Katie and the shirtwaist-maker, just ready for bed, heard the\\r\\nfaint sound without and, opening the door, caught the almost fainting\\r\\nfigure in their arms.  The dark cloak dropped open, disclosing the\\r\\ncrimson kimona beneath, and this, awakening Violet\\'s one dominating\\r\\npassion--the terror of detection and consequent recapture--roused the\\r\\nfugitive a little.  She staggered away from the assisting hands,\\r\\nwrapped the cloak tightly around her, and leaned, panting, against\\r\\nthe wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss--Miss Flanagan?\" she gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie nodded her black head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s me,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m--I\\'m the--I\\'m Violet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish girl comprehended quickly.  With Irish tact she refused,\\r\\njust then, to hear more; with Irish volubility she burst into\\r\\nexclamations of pity, and with ready Irish sympathy she took Violet\\r\\nin her strong arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put her on my cot,\" said Carrie, and they led her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took away her cloak, for she was now too weak to protest, and,\\r\\nthough they did pause in awe before the crimson kimona, they hurried\\r\\nto make their guest comfortable.  The Lithuanian Jewess moved\\r\\nsilently and swiftly about with that calm competence which\\r\\ncharacterizes her people, and Katie, fanning the white face and\\r\\nchafing the thin hands, continued to croon condolences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There now!\" she at last smiled, as Violet\\'s blue eyes opened.  \"Sure\\r\\nyou\\'re yourself again entirely.  Don\\'t say a word, not one word, an\\'\\r\\njust tell us whatever \\'tis you might be wantin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whiskey,\" gasped Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls looked at each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" said the Jewess, quietly; \"I can spare it\"--and\\r\\nshe handed Katie some small change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish girl flung a shawl over her head, and ran down the stairs.\\r\\nShe went into the side door of the nearest saloon, entered a narrow\\r\\ncompartment, passed the money through a hole in a partition, and was\\r\\ngiven a small flask partly filled.  Within five minutes she had\\r\\nreturned, and Violet, drinking the contents of the bottle at a single\\r\\ndraught, began to revive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you hungry, darlin\\'?\" asked Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet shook her russet head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I couldn\\'t eat, thanks.  I\\'m only just played\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor dear, you look it.  But you\\'re all right now, an\\' you can rest\\r\\nas long as you like.  Don\\'t you bother.  Don\\'t you worry.  Don\\'t you\\r\\nbe afraid.  You got away without any trouble, did you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Violet, and because she was still unable to frame her\\r\\nlips to adequate thanks, she gave them as much of the story of her\\r\\nescape as she could give without mention of the name of her rescuer,\\r\\nwho had warned her that he must not be publicly known to figure in\\r\\nthe case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man?\" echoed the cynical Katie.  \"An\\' he didn\\'t ask nothin\\' in\\r\\nreturn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be worth knowin\\', that man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He only wants me to go somewhere an\\' swear to all Rose done to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\"--Katie\\'s tone showed that she could now account for the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s generosity.--\"Well, don\\'t you do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Violet could not follow her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know just why; but don\\'t you do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I promised,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Och, listen to the poor dear!\" Katie appealed to her fellow-lodger.\\r\\n\"I wonder is it long she thinks he\\'d be keepin\\' his word to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own word freshened the ever-abiding terror in the runaway\\'s\\r\\nheart, but Violet said no more about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you have much to swear to?\" asked Carrie, seated on the foot\\r\\nof the cot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" Violet parried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She means, Violet----\" began Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fugitive, in her new surroundings, shrank from the name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t!  Don\\'t call me that!\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure an\\' ain\\'t it the name you gave me yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know, but I don\\'t want to hear it ever again.  Call me Mary; call\\r\\nme Mary----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there, face to face with a new danger, Violet came to a stop.\\r\\nHer captivity had taught her much of bestiality, but it had taught\\r\\nher besides only that some unknown, tremendous power hated her; that\\r\\nshe was debased and must never, at whatever cost of further suffering\\r\\nto herself, permit her degradation to attach to her family; that she\\r\\nmust escape, but that she must also wholly divorce herself from all\\r\\nthat life had meant her to be.  She had no thought of the future; she\\r\\nhad only a realization of what had been and what was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary what?\" asked Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary Morton,\" lied Violet.  Perhaps she had heard the name before;\\r\\nperhaps the easy alliteration brought it first to her mind.  At all\\r\\nevents, she reflected, one name was as good as another, so long as it\\r\\nwas not her own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you have much to swear to?\" Carrie was continuing.  \"Is it as\\r\\nbad as they say--there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet looked at the round, serious face before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know what they say,\" she replied; \"but it\\'s worse than\\r\\nanybody can say.  There\\'s a lot of it you can\\'t say, because there\\'s\\r\\na lot of it there ain\\'t no words ever been made up for.  Just you\\r\\npray God you won\\'t ever have to find out how bad it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at her and saw on her the marks of which she was not yet\\r\\naware.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie bent over and swiftly kissed the fevered forehead under its\\r\\ntumbled russet hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You poor woman,\" she said with unintended implication, \"an\\' how many\\r\\nyears did you have to stand it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t years; it was--it was only weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?  An\\' they could get a grown woman like you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet tried to smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old do you think I am?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie made what she considered a charitable reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-five?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not seventeen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie began to busy herself about the room, and Carrie turned her\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, well,\" said Katie, \"you\\'re tired out, an\\' it\\'s \\'most mornin\\'.\\r\\nWe must all go to sleep now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only put on long dresses in April,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Katie seemed not to hear her.  She hurried the arrangements for\\r\\nthe night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sleep as long as you like in the morning,\" said Carrie; \"and if you\\r\\ncan wear any of our things, wear \\'em.  We have to get up early, but\\r\\ndon\\'t mind us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter injunction was unnecessary.  Though Violet had for some\\r\\ntime been excited by her escape, that excitement had already given\\r\\nplace to utter exhaustion.  The lamp had scarcely been extinguished\\r\\nbefore, with throbbing head, she passed into a sleep that was almost\\r\\ncoma, and the lamp that was burning when she opened her aching eyes\\r\\nwas the lamp of midmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was alone and afraid to be alone.  Her head seemed splitting.\\r\\nShe saw the milk and rolls that Katie had set out for her on the\\r\\noilcloth-covered table, but her stomach revolted at the thought of\\r\\nfood, and her poisoned nerves cried out for alcohol.  She got up and\\r\\nmanaged to pull on some of the clothes belonging to her two hostesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom her first glance at the mirror, she drew back in bewilderment.\\r\\nDuring all her imprisonment she had been used, through her gradual\\r\\nchange, to compare her morning appearance with that of her fellow\\r\\nslaves; but now there was fresh in her mind the standard, not of\\r\\nthose pale and worn, though often fat and hardened, convicts, but of\\r\\nthe pair of healthy girls that had, the night before, sheltered her;\\r\\nand from that standard her very image in the glass seemed to withdraw\\r\\nin horror.  Lacking rouge, her cheeks, once so pink and firm, were\\r\\npasty and pendant; her lips hung loose, her blue eyes were dull and\\r\\nblurred; even her hair appeared colorless and brittle.  Little lines\\r\\nhad formed at the corners of her eyes; her skin seemed rough and\\r\\ncracked, and other lines were already faintly showing from her\\r\\nnostrils to the corners of her mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down on the cot, sick and shivering.  When she noticed a\\r\\nsmall pile of bedding in the corner behind the gas-stove, she shook\\r\\nat the memory of another such pile on another terrible morning, and\\r\\nby the time she had realized that one of her friends must have slept\\r\\nthere in order to provide an extra couch, she was too wracked by\\r\\nsuffering, physical and mental, to feel, at once, any great\\r\\ngratitude.  The fever throbbed in her wrists, beat in her heart,\\r\\nhammered in her brain.  She did not dare go to the street for whiskey\\r\\nor medicine.  At every sound on the stairs she started up in the\\r\\nassurance that her keepers had come to recover her, and when, in the\\r\\nearly afternoon, a loud knocking sounded on the door, she fell, in\\r\\nunresponding silence, before Katie\\'s flaring lithograph of Our Lady\\r\\nof the Rosary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello in there!\" called a not overcautious voice.  \"I want to talk\\r\\nto Miss Violet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet raised her clasped hands to the printed face before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t let them take me!\" she whispered in a prayer to that visible\\r\\nsign of a power she had never before addressed.  \"Don\\'t let them take\\r\\nme!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open up, can\\'t you?\" the voice insisted.  \"I know there\\'s somebody\\r\\ninside, an\\', honest, I\\'m not going to hurt you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s hands fell.  The voice, she realized, was at least\\r\\nunfamiliar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on,\" it wheedled.  \"I\\'m all right; I\\'m from Mr. Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said Miss Violet would know,\" came the answer.  \"He said I would\\r\\nbe expected--that it\\'d be all right if I just told you I came from\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet had not forgotten Katie\\'s warning, but she was unable wholly\\r\\nto doubt the one man that had befriended her.  She opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pink-and-white young clerk that entered was much embarrassed, and\\r\\nhis hostess, in her fever, did not ease him.  Nevertheless, after\\r\\nmany hesitations on his own part, and more repetitions and\\r\\nexplanations made necessary by Violet, he at last convinced her that\\r\\nhe did indeed come from Wesley Dyker, and that there was waiting\\r\\naround the corner the cab that would convey her to an office where\\r\\nshe could begin the redemption of her pledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost in a dream, and too ill now much to care what happened to her,\\r\\nshe followed the messenger.  Dazedly she greeted Dyker in the cab;\\r\\nconfusedly she left that conveyance for an office where she answered\\r\\ninterminable questions put to her by another young man who, she was\\r\\ntold, was an Assistant District Attorney; vaguely she heard Dyker\\r\\nassure this official, as she affixed a signature to an offered paper,\\r\\nthat Wesley would himself guarantee her appearance whenever it was\\r\\nrequired, and when she was at last wheeled back and had climbed the\\r\\nstairs and, alone, fallen again upon Carrie\\'s cot, the only one of\\r\\nrecent facts concerning which she was at all certain was that she had\\r\\nsaid she was a native of Pittsburgh and that her name was Mary Morton.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie and Carrie, returning together, found her flushed and babbling\\r\\nnonsense.  When they approached her, she did not recognize them, and\\r\\nthen, for an hour, they could get from her only the monotonous\\r\\nrepetition:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t let them get me!  Don\\'t tell them my name!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was eight o\\'clock before the patient, quieted by sympathy and\\r\\nstimulated by whiskey, could be taken to the nearest drugstore, and\\r\\nthere, as soon as the experienced druggist set eyes on her, he\\r\\nrefused to prescribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe beckoned Katie to a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That girl\\'s got to go to a hospital,\" he said; \"and if I was you, I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t lose much time in getting her there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie the competent lost none.  After another drink to stifle\\r\\npossible protest, Violet was taken upon a car to Sixteenth Street,\\r\\nand was then walked quickly westward.  During all the way she did not\\r\\nspeak, and, when she reached the hospital\\'s fortunately empty\\r\\nreceiving-ward, she was nearly unconscious.\\r\\n\\r\\nA white-capped nurse received the little party, the young doctor, in\\r\\nshirt-sleeves and duck trousers, hovering in the background among the\\r\\nglass shelves agleam with instruments of polished steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the trouble?\" asked the nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s that that we\\'ve come to find out of you,\" answered Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse nodded to the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came forward and made a quick examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring this woman inside and put her on the table,\" he ordered.  \"And\\r\\nyou girls, stop where you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer head thrown back, her dry mouth wide, and her russet hair\\r\\nfalling, the unresisting Violet was carried behind a door that shut\\r\\nsmartly after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo scared to speak, Katie and her companion stood outside.  Five\\r\\nminutes passed.  Then ten.  After a quarter of an hour, the door\\r\\nreopened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this patient\\'s name?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary Morton,\" said Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where does she live?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie gave her own address, and the doctor, a pad of printed forms in\\r\\nhand, noted both the answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat done, he paused and bit his pencil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Married?\" he asked quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?\" parried Katie.  \"Me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; the patient.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now,\" began Katie, \"I can\\'t see as that\\'s----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the calm voice of Carrie interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is married,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor pursed incredulous lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s her husband?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie, who had caught the need of the moment, jumped into the breach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where a lot of them are,\" she responded, \"an\\' where as many more\\r\\nmight as well be, for all the use they are to their poor wives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Faith, it\\'s you, sir, ought to know: you\\'re the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much later than yesterday, did he?  Well, I must find her\\r\\nnearest relative or friend.  Are you either?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie\\'s face lengthened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Och, doctor,\" she said, \"you don\\'t mean to--but it can\\'t be that\\r\\nthere\\'s goin\\' to be a baby!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young interne grinned.  Then, serious again, he answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, there is not.  I only wish it was so simple.  Where are her\\r\\nfolks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s none in the world, an\\' no money.  The hard truth is, doctor,\\r\\nthat it\\'s a charity-patient she\\'ll have to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right; but are you her nearest friends?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, doctor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'ll do, I guess.  She\\'s a nervous wreck--among other things.\\r\\nWe\\'ve first of all got to get her round from that condition, and then\\r\\nI\\'ll have to secure either her own or your permission, as her nearest\\r\\nfriends, to do something more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More?\" repeated Katie.  \"Ain\\'t it bad enough as it is?  What more do\\r\\nyou mean to do to the poor--girl?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t mean to do anything myself, but this is a common enough kind\\r\\nof case around here to make me certain what the resident surgeon will\\r\\ndo: he\\'ll operate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A NET BY THE WAYSIDE\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann Hoffmann, passing one evening to the little clothes-press\\r\\nbehind the bar in Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon, and putting on the canvas\\r\\ncoat that was his badge of office, heard the voice of the proprietor\\r\\ncalling his name, and turned to see that stout German-American\\r\\nbeckoning him to enter the back-room where, a month before, O\\'Malley\\r\\nhad held with Wesley Dyker that conference which had proved so\\r\\ndisastrous to Rose Légère.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked through the open door, whistling his Teutonic melody.  He\\r\\nhad not that fear of his employer which most employees have of the\\r\\nman for whom they work.  Schleger had proved himself lenient and\\r\\ngood-natured, and Hermann, whose cheerful round face and easy smile\\r\\ndid not interfere with the use of a knotted arm and a mighty fist,\\r\\nwas quite aware that there was no complaint justly to be made against\\r\\nthe manner in which he performed his alloted tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hoffmann,\" said Schleger, smiling, \"you\\'re all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure,\" grinned Hermann.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" pursued the proprietor, \"I been thinkin\\' about you that you\\r\\nsure have made good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad you vas sadisfied, Schleger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am satisfied; but I think you need a little more time off now an\\'\\r\\nthen.  I haven\\'t got nothin\\' to do this evenin\\'.  I\\'ll take your\\r\\nplace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann\\'s eyes brightened with unaffected pleasure.  It had not\\r\\nalways been pleasant to work in the nights when Katie was all day\\r\\nbusy in the shop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" nodded Schleger, benignantly; \"it will be like old times for\\r\\nme.  You take a night off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I start out righd avay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.--Of course you understand I\\'ll want you around here the\\r\\nday of the primaries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Hermann, there\\'s somethin\\' else I\\'ve been meanin\\' to talk to you\\r\\nabout, and kep\\' forgettin\\' till O\\'Malley reminded me of it again this\\r\\nafternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHoffmann, pulling off his white jacket, stopped with arms extended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O\\'Malley?\" he said in a strained voice.  \"Vat\\'s dot man got to do\\r\\nvith me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know he don\\'t miss no tricks nowheres, an\\' some time back\\r\\nI was tellin\\' him what a good man you was, an\\' he said we ought to\\r\\nget you a little more active for him.  A fellow behind a bar can do a\\r\\nwhole lot that way, you know,--an\\' make a good thing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" replied Hermann, ripping off the coat, \"but I ain\\'t no\\r\\npolitician.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody said you was, but all the fellows help a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure; only I don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?  We want to do well for the slate this time.  Wesley\\r\\nDyker\\'s on it; you know him; he\\'s all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t no politician, Schleger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis stolid attitude plainly began to puzzle the proprietor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be a fool, Hoffmann,\" he said.  \"The boys all have their eye\\r\\non you, an\\' O\\'Malley don\\'t forget any of his friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Schleger, I got my own friends, und I make my own friends.  I don\\'t\\r\\nvant nussing I don\\'t earn from nobody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that sort of thing won\\'t look right,\" argued Schleger.  \"You\\r\\nsee, you\\'re registered from here--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No I ain\\'t, Schleger; I\\'m registered from my own blace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I didn\\'t know that; you didn\\'t tell me, an\\' so I registered\\r\\nyou from here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHoffmann\\'s pink cheeks became red.  He folded his coat neatly over\\r\\nhis arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vatch here, Schleger,\" he began.  \"I ain\\'t no politician.  I don\\'t\\r\\ncare----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he bit his lip and mastered himself to silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proprietor saw this and appreciated the self-control that it\\r\\nmanifested.  There had been a time when he had felt as Hermann felt\\r\\nnow, and so he was not disposed to use harsh argument.  He came close\\r\\nto Hoffmann and, still smiling, dropped his voice to a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" he said, soothingly.  \"I guess I know how you\\r\\nlook at it.  Don\\'t say that I said so, but we\\'ll let the matter drop\\r\\nif you only lay low a little and keep quiet.  You know the brewery\\'s\\r\\nbackin\\' me in this saloon, an\\' you know, with the brewery pushin\\' me\\r\\nall the time for its money, I couldn\\'t run the place a month if I\\r\\ndidn\\'t keep the side-door open Sundays.  Well, then, how could I keep\\r\\nthe place workin\\' Sundays if it wasn\\'t for O\\'Malley?  Just try not to\\r\\nbe openly again\\' him, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann did not commit himself, but his tone had softened when, in\\r\\nreply, he asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Und should I take to-night off?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly you should.  Go along now, an\\' ferget it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went, but as he walked down the avenue, \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\"\\r\\nissued from his lips to the time of a funeral-march.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sole consolation lay in the fact that, in the recent glimpses he\\r\\nhad secured of Katie, that young lady had begun to evince signs of\\r\\nrelenting from her former attitude of celibacy.  He knew that she had\\r\\ngradually ceased to descant upon the impossibility of his supporting\\r\\na wife, and he thought that she was entertaining hopes of a promotion\\r\\nin the shop to a position where her own earnings, added to his, would\\r\\nmake a comfortable living-wage for two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat he did not know--and this for the excellent reason that Katie\\r\\nwould not tell it to him--was that, whatever their prospects for the\\r\\nfuture, both Katie and her roommate were still engaged in that battle\\r\\nwith poverty and temptation which had lessened scarcely one whit\\r\\nsince its beginning.  For the former the fortunes of war were less\\r\\nthan ever favorable, and for the latter the most that was expected\\r\\nwas the maintenance of her stand in the face of every armed reason to\\r\\nsurrender or retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strike dragged along its wearied length.  Popular sympathy, which\\r\\nhad aided the shirtwaist-makers in their former rebellion, had lost\\r\\nits interest in the cause, and, as the newspapers said less, the\\r\\nemployers became more demonstrative.  Hired thugs guarded the\\r\\nfactories and beat whatever young women dared, by the simplest words,\\r\\nto plead, in public, with the scab laborers.  When these battles\\r\\noccurred the police, knowing well the interests of their masters,\\r\\narrested the mere girls for assault and battery upon the thugs,\\r\\nforcing them to remain, if detained, on benches with women old in\\r\\nimmorality and crime; and the magistrates before whom these dangerous\\r\\nfemale criminals were hailed, not forgetting which party to the suit\\r\\ncould vote at the coming election, would often send the offenders to\\r\\nthe Reformatory or the Island, where they could no longer interfere,\\r\\nor would impose fines calculated still more to deplete a strike-fund\\r\\nalready pitiably shrunken.  Some of the unionists had already laid\\r\\ndown their arms and returned to the factories; more had gone over to\\r\\nanother enemy and disappeared beneath the dark current of the\\r\\nunderworld.  The rest--and Carrie was among the number--must soon\\r\\ncome face to face with starvation.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie\\'s difficulties, though as yet less physical, were scarcely less\\r\\npoignant.  She found that she was rarely left long in one portion of\\r\\nthe Lennox shop.  From the chief woman\\'s-hosiery department, she was\\r\\nshifted, without warning, to the handkerchief counter, and thence,\\r\\nagain with no explanation, she was sent to help in the main aisle at\\r\\na table where there was a special sale of stockings at reduced prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first these frequent shiftings appeared to result from no apparent\\r\\ncause.  She was fined as much as the other clerks, but no more than\\r\\nthey, and she could in no wise account for the changes.  But at last\\r\\nshe noticed that after a shift for the worse the sacrosanct Mr.\\r\\nPorter would usually happen by and open a conversation, and then she\\r\\nremembered that, before such a shift, this same side-whiskered\\r\\ngentleman had generally made overtures, and that those overtures had\\r\\nnot been well received.  The theory arising from these observations\\r\\nshe resolved to confirm.  After the next move she made deliberate\\r\\neyes at the man she detested, and she was next day promoted, with a\\r\\ntwenty-five cent increase of pay per week, to the silk-stocking\\r\\ncounter.  From that day she saw her warfare developing into a\\r\\ndangerous game of hide-and-seek in which Mr. Porter was \"It,\" and\\r\\nfrom that day dated her increasing tendency to reconsider the\\r\\ndetermination not to marry Hermann Hoffmann.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Violet, meanwhile, the young interne\\'s prophesy had been\\r\\nfulfilled.  Four days after her admission to the hospital there had\\r\\nbeen performed upon her that operation which had been made necessary\\r\\nby her servitude, but to which, had she been consulted, her fears\\r\\nwould never have allowed her to consent.  For three weeks she lay in\\r\\nher narrow bed among other sufferers, and, when at last the fiction\\r\\nof discharging her as \"cured\" had been accomplished, and the\\r\\nfive-cent carfare donated by the hospital to charity-patients had\\r\\nbeen given, she had been met by Katie and Carrie, and had tottered\\r\\nbetween them to their room.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring another week she had now rested there.  Her eyes were still\\r\\nsunken, dull, dark-rimmed; her cheeks white and transparently thin.\\r\\nThe knuckles of her fingers seemed to have grown larger, and her\\r\\nhands were nearly transparent.  But her lips, though bloodless, had\\r\\ngained a new firmness.  Clearly or deeply she could never think,\\r\\nwithout help from a stronger and better mind; yet she had made what\\r\\nuse she might of her long leisure and had resolved, more or less\\r\\ndefinitely, upon what she would do with her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went out an\\' walked a block by myself yesterday,\" she confessed to\\r\\nher two friends early on the evening of Hermann\\'s political\\r\\ndiscussion with his employer; \"an\\' I didn\\'t get any tired an\\' wasn\\'t\\r\\nhardly any scared.  Now I want you to take me for a longer walk\\r\\nto-night an\\' then by to-morrow I\\'ll be all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey protested that she must not spur her convalescence, but she was\\r\\ndetermined.  It was, she knew, impossible for them much longer to\\r\\nsupport her, and the last of her one ten-dollar bill had long ago\\r\\nbeen spent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what we might do,\" Carrie at last suggested.  \"There\\'s\\r\\nsome sort of a concert over at the settlement to-night.  We might go\\r\\nto that.  I used to know some of the ladies there, and there\\'s always\\r\\na chance that they can get you a job.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was speaking Hermann\\'s whistle, more cheerful now than when\\r\\nhe had left the saloon, sounded on the stairs, and Katie, surprised\\r\\nand glad, opened the door to his knock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Late to your work again,\" she said, with a smile that belied her.\\r\\n\"How\\'ll you ever be holdin\\' that job, anyhow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newcomer\\'s only answer was a courageous and unrebuked kiss.  He\\r\\nturned to Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vat you sink of such a vay of meetin\\' me?\" he appealed.  \"My boss\\r\\ngives me a nighd off, und I haf seen my girl not fur ten days und\\r\\nden----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused as his unrecognizing eye fell upon Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Egscuse me,\" he began.  \"I didn\\'t see----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you didn\\'t see it was your old friend Violet that was an\\'\\r\\nMiss Morton that is,\" interrupted Katie, with a quick desire to\\r\\nshield her charge.  \"You\\'re gettin\\' that near-sighted I wonder how\\r\\nyou can tell a whiskey-glass from a beer-stein.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann hurried forward in rosy embarrassment and saved Violet from\\r\\nrising.  He took her frail hand in his big paw and poured out a\\r\\ntumbling stream of polite lies upon the matter of her health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess it ain\\'t quite as good as you say,\" replied Violet; \"but it\\r\\nsoon will be.  Have you--I didn\\'t get no news while I was sick.  Have\\r\\nyou heard anything about--things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You knew Rose\\'s place was pinched?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Katie told me that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, dey had some trouble gettin\\' pail fur her.  Everybody vas\\r\\nafraid fur to do it vith O\\'Malley after her.  Still, dey vorked it\\r\\nsomevays und nobody thought but she\\'d jump it und run avay; but she\\r\\ndidn\\'t.  She tried, but O\\'Malley had central office men keepin\\' eyes\\r\\non her, und she can\\'t leaf town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie and Carrie were busying themselves in the preparation of the\\r\\nsupper, and the German seated himself beside the invalid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Hoffmann,\" she said, \"I\\'ve been tryin\\' to think of lots of\\r\\nthings while I\\'ve been sick, an\\' I\\'d like to know how it is that\\r\\nwomen like Miss Rose are allowed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her, hesitating, but her eyes were frankly curious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dot\\'s von long story,\" he answered in his slow tones, \"un\\' dem as\\r\\ncan tell it best is most all in deir houses or in deir graves, or\\r\\nelse, in de streets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I guess I was lucky to get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you don\\'t mind me sayin\\' it--yes, miss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But don\\'t the girls get free when the houses are pinched?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hermann, as gently as he could; \"dey don\\'t get free.  Ofer\\r\\nto de Night Court a voman has taken five s\\'ousand to a blace she has,\\r\\nund how many sink you didn\\'t go back to de vork again?  Less\\'n von\\r\\nhundret und fifty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see how they could,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann could not see how they could do anything else, but he only\\r\\nshrugged his broad shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They don\\'t last long anyvays,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean they die soon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Effery five year all de girls is new: it\\'s as sure as life\\r\\ninsurance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl shuddered, but mastered herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t mind that,\" she reassured him.  \"I want to know--honest.\\r\\nKatie and Carrie won\\'t be bothered----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can\\'t hear a word you\\'re sayin\\', darlin\\',\" laughed Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\', honest,\" Violet concluded.  \"There\\'s some things I think I\\'ve\\r\\ngot to learn so\\'s I can see it--see it _all_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe appealed, it happened, to an authority.  Hermann supplemented his\\r\\nMarx with facts and statistics of a later date, especially upon the\\r\\npoint at issue, and he was only too glad to find in Violet the\\r\\nlistener that he could never discover in Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re righd,\" he said; \"und the only pity is dot more people don\\'t\\r\\ntry to more about it learn.  If dey did, maybe ve\\'d all open our eyes\\r\\nsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he proceeded to open Violet\\'s eyes not a little.  He told her of\\r\\nthe hundreds of thousands of girls that are annually caught in the\\r\\ngreat net; of how five thousand new ones are every year needed to\\r\\nmaintain Chicago\\'s standing supply of twenty-five thousand; of how\\r\\nBoston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco--all the cities and\\r\\nthe towns--are served proportionately, and of how, above all, from\\r\\nthe crowded East Side of New York, there are dragged each week\\r\\nhundreds of children and young women no one of whom, if sold\\r\\noutright, brings as much as a capable horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some ve bring in,\" he said, \"und some ve send out.  Ve take from\\r\\nItaly, und ve send to Sous America.  From all ofer the vorld ve take,\\r\\nund to all ofer the vorld ve send.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t always blame the girls?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Plame dem?  A girl as lived by us, she did tucking in a undervear\\r\\nfactory.  She has coffee und a roll fur preakfast, tea und a roll fur\\r\\nlunch, von biece of bacon und von egg fur supper effery nighd.  Ten\\r\\nhours a day in a bad smelling room, crowded vis ozzer girls, she runs\\r\\ndot machine.  Part de year she has no vork, because always de factory\\r\\ndoes not run, but vhen de years ends, dot machine, makin\\' four\\r\\ndousand stitches a minute, she has tucked dree miles of undervear und\\r\\ngot paid dree hundred dollars.  Do I plame such a girl if she easy\\r\\ncomes to belief a paid veasel as makes lofe to her und says he\\r\\nmarries her und gets her avay from a factory?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All of the girls don\\'t come from such hard jobs though.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So?  Look now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took from an inside pocket a fistful of soiled envelopes and\\r\\nshuffled them until he found one on which he had transcribed some\\r\\nfigures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesderday afternoon to dis Astor Library I found a report vat vas\\r\\nmade by people sent out by de State of Massachusetts.  It got a kind\\r\\nof census from four dousand vomen in sixty different cities, all\\r\\nofer.  Before dey vent bad, five hundret vas garment-vorkers, und\\r\\neight hundret vas rope-makers, milliners, laundry people, paper-box,\\r\\ncigar und cigarette makers, candy-box packers, or vorked in textile\\r\\nmills or shoe factories.  All dem, see, vorked in de poor paid\\r\\ntrades, und a hundret und sixteen come from department-stores, und\\r\\ndot\\'s as bad as Katie\\'ll tell you.  Vorse yet de job of\\r\\nhouse-servant--sixty per cent. vas dot.  Und all de rest--all de\\r\\nozzer sixty-two per cent.--vere girls who hadn\\'t had not jobs, und\\r\\ndey had to live und couldn\\'t no ozzer vay earn a livin\\'!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you think,\" asked Violet, \"they wouldn\\'t go wrong if they could\\r\\nget decent work at decent wages?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann looked at her quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vould you?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shivered and shook her head and Hermann, seeing that the heat of\\r\\nhis zeal had led him into a personal appeal that all his normally\\r\\nslow instincts prompted him to avoid, hurried back to the safe ground\\r\\nof generalities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody vat knows,\" he said, \"could belief it.  Nobody vat knows\\r\\ncould belief girls\\'d go into such a life, or once dey got into it\\r\\nstay dere, because dey vanted to.  Vell, vat den?  Ve must find out\\r\\nvhy is it dey gets in und vhy dey stay.  It is because all de whole\\r\\nluckier vorld lets dem be kep\\' fast, und, first und foremost, because\\r\\nall de whole luckier vorld lets dose factories dey come from be bad\\r\\nblaces, und couldn\\'t gif dose ozzer sixty-two-per-cent girls no ozzer\\r\\nvay to earn a livin\\' yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet thought again, as she still so often thought, of Max.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' what about the men that start them?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann brought his heavy fist down upon his knee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dem too!\" he said.  \"Dem is de vorst mens in de vorld.  If I can\\r\\nhate any man, dey is him.  It makes my red blood to steam und my skin\\r\\nto get all brickly to see dem or sink of dem.  But I know dot dey,\\r\\ntoo, are results of conditions, und dey sink dot dey are doing\\r\\nkindness to de girls by not letting dem go to chail or starve.  De\\r\\nvorst mens in de vorld--next to politicians as lets dem live und\\r\\ntakes most dot dey earn!  Und de politicians demselves are only vat\\r\\ndot big system as makes us all vork for less as ve earn, und makes us\\r\\nall pay more as ve can--only vat de big system makes dem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet understood but partially; yet she had seen enough to know that\\r\\nthe slavery must have its political side, and it was concerning this\\r\\nthat she now asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Hermann made wholly clear.  He told her the story of the growth\\r\\nof political parties, the development of political machines, the\\r\\nnecessary preying of these machines, in every city, first upon\\r\\ngambling and then, as that passed, upon prostitution, and of how this\\r\\nmeant both money and votes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he talked, she learned how this brought into being the\\r\\n\"cadets\"--the followers of the low heelers--who scoured their own and\\r\\nother towns, hanging about the doors of factories, tenements,\\r\\nshops--wherever the life was so hard as to drive those who lived it\\r\\nto despair--themselves impelled by economic conditions, by the choice\\r\\nbetween hard work and small pay on the one hand and base work and\\r\\nbetter pay on the other, and themselves forced into the \"gangs\" of\\r\\nchildish marauders while at the primary schools, and so trained\\r\\nupward, step by step, to the \"gang\" of the politician.  She learned\\r\\nhow, after the last outcry, a popular leader had struck a cadet, in\\r\\nthe presence of the press-agents, and then, when this one blow was\\r\\ntaken as the end of the infamous relation, had quietly joined with\\r\\nhis fellows in strengthening that relation as it never could have\\r\\nbeen strengthened with the attention of the public upon it.  And she\\r\\nlearned how the result had been a whole criminal confederacy, with\\r\\nits capital in the poorer quarters, bound together politically and\\r\\nfinancially, with its officers, its agents, and its regularly\\r\\nretained lawyers, at once to defend and to attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of his own observation, Hermann told her of the saloons that were\\r\\nin reality the clubs of these procurers.  He sketched the methods of\\r\\nprocuring false bail-bonds, of influencing magistrates, juries, and\\r\\neven judges, and of turning upon the few conscientious policemen with\\r\\nsuits charging oppression and false arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O\\'Malley und dese ozzer mens like him ofer here make sometimes all\\r\\nof sixty dousand a year,\" he declared, \"und de people lofe dem\\r\\nbecause dese O\\'Malleys take deir daughters durin\\' twelve mont\\'s und\\r\\ngif dem coal fur four.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' no one person is to blame?\" asked Violet in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I vish dere vas, but dere ain\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So there ain\\'t no way out of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Von vay--und only von.  For de single time badness makes poverty,\\r\\nninety-nine times poverty it makes badness.  Do avay vith poverty.\\r\\nReorganize de whole of de industrial system; gif effery man und voman\\r\\na chance to vork; gif effery man und voman effery penny dey earns.\\r\\nSo only you do avay vith poverty, so only you do avay vith unhappy\\r\\nund discontented homes und unhappy und discontented people, und so\\r\\nonly you do avay vith badness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in the midst of his subject when Katie served the scanty\\r\\nsupper, and he would have had neither time nor inclination for the\\r\\nmere eating had not his sweetheart sternly ordered him to be silent.\\r\\nBut, as soon as the meal was over and the few dishes washed, he\\r\\ncontinued his talk to Violet as, with the two girls ahead of her, she\\r\\nleaned heavily on his arm all the way to Rivington Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concert was, it must be confessed, interesting chiefly to the\\r\\nwomen that had promoted it, the young people that took part in it,\\r\\nand the relatives of the performers, who succeeded or failed\\r\\nvicariously.  Stiffly seated in the cleared gymnasium, a little\\r\\nashamed and wholly ill at ease, the audience, drawn from the\\r\\nneighborhood and from among the friends of the settlement-workers,\\r\\nbore it, however, with commendable fortitude.  They heard an amateur\\r\\norchestra play \"La Paloma\" out of time; they heard Eva Aaronsohn read\\r\\nan essay on \"A Day in Central Park\"; they heard a promising soprano\\r\\nsolo spoiled by fright, and a promising baritone not yet escaped from\\r\\nthe loosening leash of boyhood.  Morris Binderwitz delivered a\\r\\nhesitating oration upon Abraham Lincoln, as culled from his former\\r\\ndebate regarding the great emancipator, and Luigi Malatesta, having\\r\\nconsulted the same original sources, repeated by rote a ten-minute\\r\\ntribute to the military genius of George Washington.  There was a\\r\\nduet, a piano solo--a simplified version of \"O Du Mein Holder\\r\\nAbendstern.\"  Everything was conscientiously applauded, nearly\\r\\neverything was encored and then, amid a scraping of chairs and more\\r\\nstrains from the amateur orchestra, the ordeal came to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the crowd slowly dispersed, Carrie made her way to the side of one\\r\\nof the women-workers with whom she had some slight acquaintance and,\\r\\nafter the formal catechism upon \"how she was doing,\" made her plea\\r\\nfor Violet.  She told, of course, nothing of the girl\\'s story, nor\\r\\nwas anything asked.  It was enough that she should say that her\\r\\nfriend was fresh from the hospital, was in need of a position, and,\\r\\nthough still weak, was able to do light housework.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman to whom this appeal was made called Marian Lennox to her\\r\\nside and, with a brief explanation of what the girl had just said,\\r\\nintroduced Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t you tell me,\" she asked, \"that you\\'d heard to-day of somebody\\r\\nthat needed an extra servant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian had heard of such an opportunity.  The word had not come at\\r\\nfirst hand, and the housewife was personally unknown to her.  She was\\r\\nsure, however, that the place was entirely estimable, and she at once\\r\\ngladly gave the address, to which her co-laborer added, upon strength\\r\\nof Carrie\\'s assurances, a recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet was brought over and presented, and when Marian saw the girl\\'s\\r\\nwan cheeks and dull eyes, and read there the plain tokens of\\r\\nsuffering, her own fine face shone with sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew Violet aside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you ever done housework before?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only at home, ma\\'am,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'ll like it, I\\'m sure.  I can\\'t see why all you girls are\\r\\nso foolish as to go into factories.  Housework is so much more\\r\\nhealthy and safe, and it\\'s just what women are made for.  It pays so\\r\\nwell, too.  Even if you can\\'t cook, you can scrub and clean and help\\r\\nand get three dollars or more a week for it, and board, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I\\'ll like it,\" Violet assented, knowing in her heart that\\r\\nshe would like any work that gave her a living and protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then be sure to come to see me after you\\'re settled,\" said Marian.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now wholly immersed in the work of the settlement; but,\\r\\nthough she had undertaken no distracting outside investigation, her\\r\\nindoor duties had thus far brought her into touch chiefly with\\r\\nchildren of the neighborhood, and from them, wise beyond their years\\r\\nas they were, she had learned only enough to feel that she had not\\r\\nyet come into touch with the great problems that her young heart was\\r\\nso eager to answer.  In this first chance to give what she conceived\\r\\nto be practical help, it seemed to her that she was at last getting\\r\\nnear to the heart of what she sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow near she had come to the heart of another problem, and how that\\r\\nproblem was involved in the problem of her own life, she little\\r\\nguessed as she smiled into Violet\\'s grateful face and, exacting\\r\\nanother promise that the girl should report to her in any difficulty,\\r\\nbade her good-night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIN SERVICE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house to which, next morning, Violet, still weak and still afraid\\r\\nof her enemies, made, with many timid inquiries, her slow way was in\\r\\nWest Ninth Street, near Sixth Avenue.  It was a four-story, grimy,\\r\\nbrick house, with rows of prying windows through which no passer\\'s\\r\\neye could pierce, a dilapidated little yard in front of it, and a\\r\\nbell-handle that, when pulled, threatened to come off in Violet\\'s\\r\\nfist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman that answered this uncertain summons much resembled the\\r\\nbuilding she inhabited.  She was tall, and she had a sharp face just\\r\\nthe color of the house-walls.  The spectacles high on her beaked nose\\r\\ngleamed like the windows and, like the windows, conveyed the\\r\\nimpression that they saw a great deal without permitting any outsider\\r\\nto look behind them.  Her once formidably austere black dress was\\r\\nrusty, and her hands were so lean that Violet felt sure they must\\r\\nstretch when one shook them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want?\" asked this woman in a voice that cut like a\\r\\nmeat-ax.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you Mrs. Turner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  What do you want?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard you needed a girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'d you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the college-settlement in Rivington Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman\\'s mouth tightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t see how anyone there come to know aught o\\' me,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Got a reference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, beginning to tremble lest this chance should slip away from\\r\\nher, fumbled after the note that had been written for her, and\\r\\nfinally found it and handed it over.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Turner\\'s gleaming glasses read it twice, plainly suspecting\\r\\nforgery.  Then she calmly placed it in her skirt pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s your home?\" she next demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Pittsburgh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum.  How much do you expect?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sixteen dollars,\" quavered Violet, who had received instructions\\r\\nfrom Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Turner shook her head vigorously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t do,\" she said.  \"Can\\'t pay it.  Twelve\\'s my best, and when I\\r\\nhave a cook--I\\'m out of one just now--all you have to do for it is to\\r\\nscrub and sweep and clean the house, wash dishes, and wait on table.\\r\\nHow long did you stay in your last place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Turner gave another skeptical \"Hum\" as Violet answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you take it at twelve dollars, or will you not?\" asked the\\r\\nwoman, sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet had been told to descend gradually and not to accept a cent\\r\\nunder fourteen dollars a month; but she was no haggler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take it,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And good pay, too, considerin\\',\" commented Mrs. Turner.  \"I dunno.\\r\\nIt someways don\\'t look reg\\'lar.  Got your trunk over to the\\r\\nsettlement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet explained that she had no trunk; that she had just come from\\r\\nthe hospital and had as yet had no opportunity to replenish what had\\r\\nbeen a sadly depleted wardrobe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum!\" said Mrs. Turner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the penetrating glare of the impenetrable spectacles she studied\\r\\nthe white face before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wait a minute,\" she concluded.  \"Not inside.  Out here on the\\r\\nstoop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came outside herself and closed and locked the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be back soon,\" she said, and Violet dumbly watched her lank,\\r\\nhatless form stride to Sixth Avenue and turn the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue to her word, Mrs. Turner was not long gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess it\\'s all right,\" she announced, as she reopened the door to\\r\\nthe house.  \"I \\'phoned that woman to the settlement.  She was out,\\r\\nbut a friend answered and said the reference is _genuwine_.  She\\r\\ndescribed you so\\'s I\\'d be sure.  Looks queer of me, p\\'r\\'aps, but a\\r\\nperson can\\'t be too careful in this town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gleaming glasses seeming to search her soul for a reply, Violet\\r\\nsaid that she supposed a great deal of care was necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try to get along without it,\" responded Mrs. Turner, \"and you\\'ll\\r\\nmighty soon find out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat ended preliminaries, and Violet, agreeing to send for her few\\r\\nbelongings, began work without further formality.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe discovered that Mrs. Turner was a New Englander, who conducted a\\r\\nboarding-house in a manner that sensibly stirred the servants\\'\\r\\nsympathies in favor of the patrons.  Just now the season had greatly\\r\\ndecreased these, but the absence of the cook--it was a chronic\\r\\nabsence--left plenty to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet had to rise with the sun and attend to the kitchen fire.  She\\r\\nhad to help the mistress in the preparation of every meal, and of the\\r\\nserving of every meal and the washing of all dishes she was left in\\r\\nsolitary authority.  She made all the beds, she emptied all the\\r\\nslops, she swept the floors, beat the rugs, cleaned the windows,\\r\\npolished the stove, and scrubbed the steps.  Even in the scant hours\\r\\nfree of actual work, she must still be within call of the door-bell\\r\\nand Mrs. Turner\\'s voice: the service was continuous from dawn until\\r\\nten o\\'clock at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been, upon a frailer nature, a terrible tax, but, fresh\\r\\nthough she was from the hospital, Violet, her sturdy stock standing\\r\\nher in excellent stead, managed so to stagger through it that her\\r\\nwracked nerves seemed actually to benefit by her physical exhaustion.\\r\\nHer lot had all the horrors of the average disregarded under-servant\\r\\nand yet, when she crept to her stifling attic room at night--a room\\r\\nventilated by only a dwarfed skylight--she slept soundly and well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation was one that could not, however, long continue.  Mrs.\\r\\nTurner was a pious woman and as such knew that there must be what she\\r\\ndescribed as \"somethin\\' sneakin\\'\" about any maid that could bear her\\r\\nill-temper.  Long experience of one servant after another leaving the\\r\\nhouse in anger, had not only innured the good lady to such losses,\\r\\nbut had ended by really creating a sort of appetite for the kind of\\r\\ncondolence that she secured from her neighbors when without servile\\r\\naid.  It was therefore with almost a desire for the worst that she\\r\\nendeavored to delve into Violet\\'s past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis course of innuendo, suggestion, and cross-questioning, pursued\\r\\nby day and night, through work and rest, in strength and weariness,\\r\\nended one afternoon when another boarder had departed, taking three\\r\\ntowels with him, as is the custom of departing boarders, and when, as\\r\\na matter of fact, Mrs. Turner secretly felt that she could no longer\\r\\nafford a maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where,\" she asked, meeting Violet on the stairs, \"is them towels as\\r\\nwas in Mr. Urner\\'s room?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, they was there this morning, before lunch--I seen \\'em\\r\\nmyself--and now they hain\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet recalled that Mr. Urner had been to his room in the meantime\\r\\nand had then left forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum,\" said Mrs. Turner; \"but you see the soap\\'s gone too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason ungiven, the landlady plainly thought that the theft\\r\\nof the soap--perhaps because of Mr. Urner\\'s personal habits--was\\r\\nproof positive that Mr. Urner could not be the thief, and that Violet\\r\\nmust be.  The girl was not in love with her work, but she was\\r\\nimmensely comforted by the shelter it gave her, and she now throbbed\\r\\nwith terror at the thought of its loss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t take it, Mrs. Turner,\" she pleaded, \"honest, I didn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t just _say_ you did,\" replied the landlady; \"but you can\\'t\\r\\nblame me if I think things, the way you come here.--Where\\'d you say\\r\\nyour home was?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question was hurled so suddenly, and was accompanied by such an\\r\\nuncommonly strong glare from the penetrating spectacles, that\\r\\nViolet\\'s slow brain tottered.  For the life of her, she could not\\r\\nthink of the city that she had formerly mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well\"--Mrs. Turner\\'s foot beat sharply on the floor--\"that ain\\'t a\\r\\nhard question, is it?  Where\\'d you say you come from?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn desperation, the girl named the first city that her lips recalled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philadelphia,\" she murmured, and realized at once that this was\\r\\nwrong and that her tormentor knew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said Pittsburgh last week, miss,\" clicked Mrs. Turner.  She\\r\\nraised a knotty finger.  \"Now I ain\\'t sayin\\' you took that soap nor\\r\\nyet them towels--mind you that--but I am sayin\\' you lied.  Me and\\r\\nliars ain\\'t good company: you\\'d better go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tears came to Violet\\'s eyes.  They overflowed and she broke down.\\r\\nIn three short sentences she had confessed enough for Mrs. Turner to\\r\\nguess the entire truth, and had cast herself upon the woman\\'s mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Alberta Turner\\'s straight bosom was no pillow for the\\r\\nunfortunate.  Rugged as it was, it was no rock of safety.  She drew\\r\\nher black figure to its greatest height; she called upon all her\\r\\nreligious experience for backing, and upon all her study of the Bible\\r\\nfor phraseology, and she launched at the girl a sermon the burden of\\r\\nwhich was that, as she would have been glad to receive into her care\\r\\na woman that had erred and had repented, so she was in Christian duty\\r\\nbound to cast forth and utterly repudiate one that had shown herself\\r\\nfar from repentance by seeking employment without first baring her\\r\\ninmost soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, in a word, was put upon the street.  She was told that she\\r\\ncould have her few possessions when she called for them, but she was\\r\\ngiven neither the Rivington Street recommendation nor a new one.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had received no leisure to see her friends of the tenement or the\\r\\nsettlement during the days of her service, and she could not bring\\r\\nherself to seek them now that the black bird had again perched upon\\r\\nher forlorn banner.  For half an hour she wandered aimlessly through\\r\\nthe quieter streets; for another half-hour she endeavored to gather\\r\\nher courage.  It was three o\\'clock in the afternoon before,\\r\\ndesperate, she had inquired of a policeman for the whereabouts of an\\r\\nemployment-agency, had found the grimy place, passed through the\\r\\ngloomy room with lines of toil-worn slatterns seated along its walls,\\r\\nand stated, in hesitant accents, her mission to the fat and frowzy\\r\\nwoman in charge at a littered desk in the room beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat woman--she had a steady, calculating eye--looked at her victim\\r\\nwith a curious appraisement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What experience?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very little,\" admitted Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well are you----\"  The woman\\'s voice dropped to the tone of\\r\\ndiscretion.--\"Are you particular?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why no,\" said Violet sadly, \"I ain\\'t particular, so as it\\'s quiet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mistress smiled sagely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can fix that all right,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she said it so knowingly that Violet found herself hurriedly\\r\\nadding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' so long as it\\'s decent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it was well she had supplemented her preceding speech, she at\\r\\nonce perceived by the change that came over the woman\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said the woman in a tone at once uninterested.  \"Well, have you\\r\\nany reference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.  You see----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind why.  If we get you a job, some of the girls have plenty,\\r\\nan\\' we can lend you one of theirs.  Go out an\\' sit down an\\' we\\'ll see\\r\\nwhat happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet returned to the dark front room and took a shrinking seat in a\\r\\ncorner among the other applicants: two lines of pasty-faced,\\r\\nungainly, and not over-cleanly women.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe picked up a tattered paper, dated the preceding day, and tried to\\r\\nread it.  She saw that the primary election had been held and that\\r\\nWesley Dyker had secured one of the nominations for magistrate; but\\r\\nshe was tired and disgusted and pursued the print no farther,\\r\\nlistening, instead, to the babble of gossip that was going on about\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she ever heard that New York was remarkable for having a model\\r\\nemployment-agency law, she would there have learned how lightly that\\r\\nlaw is enforced and how much the employment-agencies of Manhattan\\r\\nresemble those of every other large city.  The foul beds in which\\r\\nthese women slept three at a time, and for the use of which the\\r\\nagencies frequently charged a dollar and a half a night; the\\r\\nexorbitant two and three dollars exacted as a fee for every position\\r\\nsecured; the encouragement given servants to make frequent changes\\r\\nand increase their fees; and the hard plight of maids dismissed from\\r\\nservice, whose only friends, being servants themselves, had no\\r\\nshelter to offer--all these things were the ordinary part and parcel\\r\\nof their talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women chattered of their old employers and bandied household\\r\\nsecrets from loose lip to lip.  Family skeletons were hauled forth\\r\\nfor merrymaking, and testimony enough to crowd a divorce-court was\\r\\ngiven against not a few respectable citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll complained of ill-housing and loneliness.  Bad enough at any\\r\\ntime, the advance of the race of flat-dwellers and the decrease of\\r\\nhouseholders had intensified all the evils that domestic servants\\r\\nhave to endure.  The best servants\\' rooms in the ordinary houses\\r\\nwere, it appeared, unheated; the worst were windowless closets in a\\r\\nkitchen or alcoves in a cellar.  None of these workers had been given\\r\\na room in which they could fittingly receive their friends, and, as\\r\\nmany of them were forbidden to have callers in the kitchen, they\\r\\nlived what social life was possible on afternoons or evenings \"off,\"\\r\\non the streets, in the parks, or aboard those floating bar-rooms that\\r\\nare called excursion-boats.  Violet remembered Fritzie; she\\r\\nremembered the heavy percentage of servants that, according to\\r\\nHermann, ended in slavery--and she began to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock there entered the room a pleasant-faced, stout woman,\\r\\nuncommonly homely, who was obviously a prospective employer.  She\\r\\nlooked about her in embarrassment, and seemed uncertain where to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet, beside whom the stranger was standing, rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you lookin\\' for the office?\" she asked.  \"I\\'ll show you the way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman seemed to like her thoughtfulness and seemed, after a quick\\r\\nglance, to like her appearance even more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not particular about the office,\" said the newcomer; \"what I\\r\\nwant is a servant.  Come outside a minute and talk to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet followed her into the street, wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they reached the pavement, the woman smiled: her smile was so\\r\\npleasant that she almost ceased to be homely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a practical person,\" she said, \"and as I also loathe and detest\\r\\nthese agencies, I always, if possible, engage a girl so that she\\r\\nwon\\'t have to pay them their commissions.--Can you do general\\r\\nhousework?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t look very strong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\'s heart throbbed.  Mrs. Turner had said that dismissal was\\r\\nthe result not of what had been done but of the thing\\'s concealment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s only because I was ill awhile ago,\" began Violet.  \"I had\\r\\nbeen in trouble----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'re quite well now?\" the woman interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite,\" answered Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not know how now to proceed; but the stranger, still smiling,\\r\\nsoon gave her a chance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any reference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, I haven\\'t no reference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How does that come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was fired from my last place.\"  She took a breath, then a greater\\r\\none, and concluded: \"I was fired because the woman I worked for found\\r\\nout that I had been in trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger promptly ceased to smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of trouble?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet saw that she had made a fatal error, but she did not know how\\r\\nto end it except by proceeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know,\" she stammered, \"there was a man----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger raised a plump, gloved hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t tell me that,\" she said.  \"I have no right to the details.  I\\r\\nthink I understand your motive, and it\\'s creditable, I must say.\\r\\nBut, my dear, I am by no means a beautiful woman and I have a very\\r\\nsusceptible husband--very.  I\\'m afraid I must be going along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd along she went, leaving Violet in a tossing sea of emotion.  Mrs.\\r\\nTurner had lied, which meant the girl must lie; this later employer\\r\\nhad said that the woman who had been enticed was generally supposed\\r\\nanxious to entice others, a theory that also meant that Violet must\\r\\nlie.  She returned to the agency, convinced that her error had lain\\r\\nonly in a lack of skill at deception.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo other customers appeared during the rest of the afternoon, and\\r\\nwhen the agency closed its doors for the night Violet, too alarmed by\\r\\nthe stories she had heard to trust herself to one of its beds, sought\\r\\nthe nearest policeman--she was losing her fear of policemen at\\r\\nlast--and had him direct her to a cheap but respectable hotel.  She\\r\\nhad a little money and she paid gladly for a room that was nearly\\r\\ncomfortable; but she could not sleep, and she returned to the\\r\\nemployment-office early in the morning with red eyes and swollen\\r\\ncheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil long after noon she sat there, waiting.  She watched everyone\\r\\nthat entered; she looked at first eagerly and at last appealingly at\\r\\nevery possible employer; but somehow the woman in the inner room\\r\\nnever sent for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Violet herself walked through the rear door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frowzy person with the calculating eyes looked at her sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You back?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I haven\\'t left,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I heard you tried to steal a customer yesterday afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That wasn\\'t no customer; it was a friend of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Well, what do you want now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A job.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that.  What else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to give you this: I have six dollars, an\\' I\\'ll give you five\\r\\ndown if you can get me a decent job in a decent house this afternoon,\\r\\nan\\' then I\\'ll give you two dollars a week out of my first three\\r\\nweeks\\' pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frowzy person screwed her lips in a downward curve that was\\r\\nprobably intended for a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve had that percentage game handed out to me about a thousand\\r\\ntimes before,\" she remarked, \"an\\' I believe in such money when I get\\r\\nit.  Still, I don\\'t mind seein\\' that five.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet produced it, and saw it swiftly vanish down a black cotton\\r\\nstocking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right.  Tell you what I\\'ll do.  Here\\'s a woman down on\\r\\nWashington Square wants a maid to wait on table.  Can you do it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can try; but of course I\\'ve never done it before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll rent you a couple of references in the name of Bella\\r\\nNimick--that\\'ll cost you two dollars more, an\\' I guess I\\'ll have to\\r\\ntrust you for it--an\\' the cook down there--she deals with us--she\\'ll\\r\\ngive you some pointers on the job.  You\\'ll find it a good place.\\r\\nThey\\'re old swells, an\\' the name\\'s Chamberlin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet lost no time in seeking this new address.  She found it to be\\r\\na large brick house, with white marble steps, facing the leafy square\\r\\nfrom the north, and looking across the broad green lawn toward a\\r\\nchurch that towered into the blue skies by day and by night reached\\r\\nup toward Heaven with a fiery cross.  The cook, to whom, through the\\r\\nareaway, she made her application, proved to be an ample Swedish\\r\\nwoman, with a heart fashioned in true proportion to her body, and a\\r\\nround, placid face that spoke well for her mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat mistress, Violet was without delay informed, was an invalid,\\r\\nwhose ills, if mostly fanciful, were at least fancied with a force\\r\\nsufficient to keep her in town and in the house all summer long.  Her\\r\\nhusband--she had remarried after a divorce--passed the warm months\\r\\nvisiting more wealthy friends along the rocky Maine coast, and her\\r\\nson ran in to see her between such invitations to Newport and\\r\\nNarragansett as he could secure.  A daughter by the second union, a\\r\\ngirl of sixteen, remained to care for her mother, and this child and\\r\\na professional nurse, whose long service made her almost a member of\\r\\nthe family, completed the household.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet was presented to Mrs. Chamberlin, a frail woman with a white,\\r\\ndelicate face, lying on a couch in a darkened library, and, her\\r\\nreferences being casually read, was promptly engaged.  She was to\\r\\nreceive eighteen dollars a month for far lighter work than had been\\r\\nher portion under the sway of Mrs. Turner, and, as Bella Nimick,\\r\\nbegan at once to see that a better time was before her.\\r\\n\\r\\nObjections there of course were, but these were not of a sort that\\r\\neither Violet\\'s previous experience or present necessity permitted\\r\\nher to observe.  Brought up in wealth, Mrs. Chamberlin\\'s ideals had\\r\\nnot been improved by that decline of fortune consequent upon her\\r\\nmarriage.  Neither in a practical nor in an executive sense had she\\r\\nreceived any training, and, though she would have told you that\\r\\nhousehold management was woman\\'s true sphere, she actually knew as\\r\\nlittle of it as she did of the wholesale drug trade.  It had never\\r\\noccurred to her that cooking was even distantly related to chemistry\\r\\nand dietetics; scrubbing, dusting, and sweeping to hygiene, or\\r\\ndomestic administration to bookkeeping.  By the same token, the two\\r\\nservants had to share a dark, narrow room in the basement, had no\\r\\nsitting-room save the kitchen and, so far as social life went, would\\r\\nhave been, had they depended upon the Chamberlin house, twin Selkirks\\r\\non a Juan Fernandez.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Violet was happy.  Her health, if it did not improve, at least\\r\\ndid not noticeably decline.  The work, if it was hard, was at least\\r\\npossible of accomplishment.  And within a week she had made herself\\r\\nso valuable to both her mistress and her mistress\\'s nurse that these\\r\\npotentates found continuous need of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the first blow fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had just put away the last of the dishes from an early dinner and\\r\\nwas passing the barred front window of the basement when, from the\\r\\nsunset across the square, a shadow descended to the floor within.\\r\\nShe looked up, startled.  In the areaway a dapper, dark, flashily\\r\\ndressed young man was standing, and the young man was Angel.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet darted away from the window, but Angel, reaching through the\\r\\nbars, calmly raised the sash, which, even in the warmest weather, was\\r\\ndrawn against the noise and dust of the street.  His dark face was\\r\\nflushed, and though his wet, red lips were smiling, they smiled\\r\\nevilly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No treecks,\" he commanded.  \"You come to me.  I wanta talk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet did not answer.  She huddled into the farthest corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stan\\' out!\" continued Angel, his lips still curved.  \"You theenka me\\r\\nso dumb?  I am sharpa \\'nough for see you.  You come here, or I go ope\\r\\nstairs an\\' reenga da bell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly, like the bird advancing to the swaying serpent, she obeyed\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" he said, when they were face to face, \"you alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thanked Heaven that they were.  The cook was in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poot on you\\' hat an\\' come alonga with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t!\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do eet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t.  The missus won\\'t let me.  It ain\\'t my night off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eef you don\\'t, I go ope stairs an\\' tell all abouta you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care.  I won\\'t go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queeck!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then da woman she fire you, an\\' I get you when you come out alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet knew that he meant it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where do you want to take me?\" she asked.  \"I won\\'t let you never\\r\\ntake me back to Rose\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No fear,\" laughed Angel, shaking his oily curls.  \"Meess Rosie she\\r\\nwould not stan\\' to have you near.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what do you want?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want you come to District Attorney\\'s, da place you go witha that\\r\\nfine gentleman Dyker.  You won\\'ta be hurt.  You can peeck out any cop\\r\\non da way to go along, an\\' you weell knowa da place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does he want me--that lawyer I talked to there before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I been to see him an\\' tell him we come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what am I to do when I get there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Taka back all you say for thata Dyke\\'.  Da\\'s all: no more--only so\\r\\nmooch.  I won\\'t bother you no more; thata lawyer won\\'t bother you no\\r\\nmore; Dyker won\\'t bother you no more.  You do that, or losa da job.\\r\\nWheech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet put her hand before her eyes.  She knew as well as a wiser\\r\\nwoman what had happened.  Angel had traced her to Katie\\'s, to the\\r\\nhospital, to the settlement, to the employment-agency--he was\\r\\ndoubtless familiar with such places--to this house.  Rose\\'s latest\\r\\ncaptive had been turned out on the streets before the raid and lost\\r\\nto sight.  The entire white-slavery charge now rested on Violet\\'s\\r\\ntestimony, and Angel\\'s purpose was to have her withdraw the affidavit\\r\\nshe had made.  In her present condition, she could not, she thought,\\r\\nbe of any further use to him; that purpose served, he would be only\\r\\ntoo glad to let her again hide herself, and, hidden here, with Dyker\\r\\nelected and engaged by newer cares, she might escape both friends and\\r\\nfoes.  Terror drove out all desire for revenge upon Rose Légère; it\\r\\ndrove out even the power to keep her promise to Dyker.  All that she\\r\\nwanted was her job.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" she said.  \"Wait till I go upstairs and get permission.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No treecks,\" cautioned Angel.  \"Eef you try treecks, I go upstair\\'\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe promised, and left him, presenting to Mrs. Chamberlin in the\\r\\nlibrary, a moment later, a face that bore out her story of the\\r\\nillness of a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the invalid, \"if you go out I shall be certain to need\\r\\nyou; but I suppose there is no help for it.  Don\\'t be gone more than\\r\\nan hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet joined Angel in the area, and went with him, but, though she\\r\\nwas disposed toward silence, she was surprised to find the Italian in\\r\\na pleasant, even a genial, mood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his moment of success, he was well-nigh magnanimous.  He bore not\\r\\na trace of malice, seeming to regard the whole matter as a game in\\r\\nwhich all the moves on both sides had been in accord with the rules.\\r\\nHe chattered a variety of gossip about everything and every person\\r\\nsave those who were most intimately concerned in his present action,\\r\\nand only as they neared the office, where a light showed that the\\r\\nyoung assistant had remained in accordance with the word that Angel\\r\\nhad previously brought him, did he touch upon the matter in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No treecks, now,\" he cautioned.  \"All you gotta do ees tella heem\\r\\nyou were Rosie\\'s frien\\' an\\' she hit you, so you gotta drunk an\\'\\r\\nwanted to maka trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t he be cross?\" asked Violet, her agitation returning anew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw,\" Angel reassured her.  \"He\\'s used to sucha t\\'ings.  Don\\'\\r\\nforgot, an\\' I give you five doll\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the office that Violet just recalled as having visited\\r\\nwith Dyker in her fever-dream.  At a desk, covered with neatly\\r\\narranged piles of papers sat the young assistant, who, having then\\r\\nseen her red with illness, and now seeing her still white from its\\r\\nrecovery, might well suppose that their first meeting was the result\\r\\nof drunken malice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here she ees,\" smiled Angel, \"like I promise.  She ees a gooda girl\\r\\nnow, an\\' sorry she tell you da deeferent story an\\' maka trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAngelelli had told Violet the truth: the young man was indeed used to\\r\\nsuch things--so used to them that he knew protest was fruitless and\\r\\nthat his inquiry must be formal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You want to withdraw your deposition?\" he asked.  He was a kindly\\r\\nyoung man with a thin face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do I what?\" asked Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He means----\" began Angel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean,\" interrupted the lawyer, \"do you want to take back the story\\r\\nyou told me about Rose Légère?  This case is on the calendar for\\r\\nto-morrow, so if you mean to take back what you said, you had better\\r\\ndo it now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It won\\'t get me into no trouble?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man raised his eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What would be the use?\" he inquired.  \"No, it won\\'t get you into any\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll take it back,\" said Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll have to be sworn, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She don\\' minda that,\" said Angel.  \"Do you, Violet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl shook her head, and a clerk was called and administered an\\r\\noath so rapidly that Violet could understand no word of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re doing this of your own free will--just because you want to?\"\\r\\nresumed the lawyer, donning his professional air, and seeming to\\r\\nbecome infected with the clerk\\'s rapidity of utterance.  \"You are not\\r\\nswayed by any promise of pecuniary reward--that is because you\\'re\\r\\npaid for it?  And there has been no force or threat used to compel\\r\\nyou to do it--I mean you haven\\'t been told you\\'d be hurt if you\\r\\nbacked down?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet bowed in token of a desire to answer these questions in\\r\\nwhatever way was necessary to her bargain, and the new deposition\\r\\nproceeded in the same manner and along the lines that Angel had laid\\r\\ndown.  The clerk hurried because he wanted to get home; the lawyer\\r\\nhurried because he thoroughly disbelieved every word that was\\r\\nwritten; and, severe as Violet had feared that the ordeal would be,\\r\\nit was over far sooner than she had expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel, still loyal to his word, saw her safely home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" he said, as he left her at the areaway, \"nobody weell ever any\\r\\nmore bother you.  Good-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his hat and went away, but, as he turned, he pressed into\\r\\nher cold hand a crisp, new bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet\\'s fingers closed about it silently.  She had earned it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\"FIAT JUSTITIA RUAT CAELUM\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trial of Rose Légère was precisely the farce that Violet had\\r\\nexpected and that Angel had planned.  In ninety of such cases out of\\r\\nevery hundred, the chief witnesses for the state are suppressed by\\r\\nfear or force, and the prosecution collapses.  Thus, in the present\\r\\ninstance, had not the newspapers made first-page announcements of the\\r\\nLégère woman\\'s arrest and so attracted to the case the momentary\\r\\nattention of an effervescing moral public, the District Attorney\\'s\\r\\noffice would, in fact, have contented itself with submitting the\\r\\nindictment and asking for a verdict of not guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Violet in the hospital during the session of the Grand Jury,\\r\\nWesley, now a man of power, had been able to refresh Larry Riley\\'s\\r\\nmemory to such a point that, in the hands of the prosecutor, the\\r\\npoliceman\\'s evidence was sufficient to insure the finding of a true\\r\\nbill; but when the case was called for trial the situation was vastly\\r\\nchanged.  The girl that had followed Violet into the net had been\\r\\ncast back into the sea of the city and utterly swallowed up.  Violet\\r\\nherself had recanted.  The elder inmates of the Légère establishment\\r\\nregarded the law as their natural enemy and, had they been disposed\\r\\nto assist it, could in no wise have been regarded as credible\\r\\nwitnesses.  The action had, therefore, to rest entirely upon Riley\\'s\\r\\ntestimony, and for Riley\\'s testimony there was virtually no\\r\\ncorroboration procurable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a good thing--I don\\'t think,\" remarked the weary-faced young\\r\\nAssistant District Attorney as, on the morning of the trial, he met\\r\\nDyker in the corridor of the court.  \"We shoved this case about five\\r\\nyears ahead on the calendar to please you, and the night before it\\'s\\r\\ncalled your witness comes to my office and eats her deposition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley had already heard that piece of news.  When, in order to keep\\r\\nan eye upon Violet, he had, some time previously, sought her at\\r\\nKatie\\'s tenement, and had received a series of uncredited vows to the\\r\\neffect that the Irish girl had no idea of the whereabouts of her late\\r\\ncharge, he had begun to look for a recantation.  It was the sort of\\r\\ngame that he had himself frequently played, and he blamed his own\\r\\nlack of foresight in not better providing against it.  Then other\\r\\ninterests had arisen.  The campaign came on apace; there were newer\\r\\nenemies than Rose to be dealt with, and, when the wires leading from\\r\\nthe District Attorney\\'s office had informed him that the expected had\\r\\noccurred, he received the word with calm philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he carelessly laughed in reply to the young assistant\\'s\\r\\nsally, \"that\\'s always the way: we elect you people into your jobs and\\r\\nthen you think that we ought to get up your cases for you and hold\\r\\nyour witnesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on his way, unconcerned.  Scarcely less concerned, the young\\r\\nassistant, knowing that his cause was lost, proceeded into court with\\r\\na solemn air calculated to convince an outraged public morality of\\r\\nhis high intent; challenged juror after juror with a frowning brow;\\r\\noutlined his case with biting logic; examined Riley, as the officer\\r\\non the beat, together with the other policemen that had made the\\r\\narrest, in an heroic style eminently pleasing to the reporters;\\r\\nfinally worked himself into a profuse perspiration of Ciceronian\\r\\ninvective against the prisoner and, mopping his weary face, sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually without concern, and knowing his cause was won, counsel for\\r\\nthe defense, a suave little personage, played his rôle as the cues\\r\\ncame to him: retained his suavity through an opening statement flatly\\r\\ndenying that of his learned young friend; pretended to drop a little\\r\\nof the suavity through a series of cutting cross-examinations that\\r\\nleft nothing of the policeman\\'s vague testimony; and gave an\\r\\nexcellent imitation of throwing away all the rest of the suavity\\r\\nwhen, in an impassioned speech, quite up to that of his learned young\\r\\nfriend, he declared that he would call no witness (which he did not\\r\\ndare to do), because the Commonwealth had wholly failed to make out\\r\\nits case (which was quite true), and because a respectable lady, the\\r\\ndaughter of a mother, had been outraged by ruffianly officers, her\\r\\nhumble home ruthlessly wrecked, and her livelihood endangered (which\\r\\nwas absolutely false).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, at last, without any pretense at concern whatever, the\\r\\nbottle-nosed personage on the bench ceased drawing pigs on his\\r\\nblotter, and, sharing the common knowledge of the fate of the case,\\r\\ngravely instructed the unwashed jury that if they thought two and two\\r\\nwere four they should so find, whereas if, on the other hand, they\\r\\nbelieved four to be the sum of one and one plus one and one they were\\r\\nto perform their sworn duty and so report.  And the unwashed jury,\\r\\nwithout leaving the court-room, declared Rose Légère an innocent\\r\\nwoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe innocent woman, still the pleasantly stout lady of the brewery\\r\\nadvertisement, shook gratefully the soft paw of her forensic defender.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank God that\\'s over,\" said she, with quite as much feeling and\\r\\nquite as much reason as many others of us return praise to Heaven for\\r\\nbenefits that originate a good deal nearer earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suave defender smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"thank God--and pay _me_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll get a check in the morning,\" Rose replied, \"an\\' I haven\\'t a\\r\\ngrudge against nobody, though I do think that other lawyer might \\'a\\'\\r\\ngot less gay with his tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was only doing his duty, Mrs. Légère.  It\\'s the law, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What if it is?  I didn\\'t make it.  What I don\\'t like to see is the\\r\\nway you people\\'ll go back on your friends because somethin\\' or\\r\\nother\\'s the law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gathered her silk skirts free of contamination by the low crowd\\r\\nin the court-room, and made her way to a waiting taxicab outside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" she said, as that vehicle began to pump through the\\r\\nstreets, \"I\\'ll pay a little call on Mr. Wesley Dyker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found him, somewhat surprised beneath his drooping lids, at his\\r\\noffice, and he immediately agreed to see her alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then,\" she said pleasantly, seating herself unasked before his\\r\\ndesk and leaning easily back in her chair, \"what I want to know is:\\r\\nAm I goin\\' to be let alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker stroked his crisp mustache.  He wanted to gain time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were acquitted, then?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Looks like it, don\\'t it?  See here, Wes, I know where all my trouble\\r\\ncome from, an\\' I can pretty well guess how it come; but I\\'m willin\\'\\r\\nto ferget it if you are.  Are you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker\\'s slow eyes were raised to hers, then lowered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right.  Now you\\'ll need me an\\' I\\'ll lend a hand, but I\\'ve got to\\r\\nknow first off if I\\'m not goin\\' to be interfered with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You had better see O\\'Malley about that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I hadn\\'t.  You went to see him first; go to him again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I----\"  Dyker twirled a pencil between his white fingers.  \"I shan\\'t\\r\\nbe sorry if I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may count on that, may I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose squared herself in her chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Got a talkin\\'-machine around here?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I\\'d like to have some soft music while I tell you the story\\r\\nof my life--see?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe you have to tell that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do.  I want you to know just what I am; then you\\'ll see\\r\\nwhether you can depend on me.  I was brought up decent--that\\'s the\\r\\ntruth.  I had my church an\\' Sunday-school like you had, an\\' perhaps\\r\\nmore.  The other sort of school I had to quit early, because my old\\r\\nman wasn\\'t paid enough to keep me on, an\\' I had to go to work myself.\\r\\nI was under the age; but I swore I wasn\\'t, so that was all right, an\\'\\r\\nafter I\\'d tramped over the whole town, I got a job filin\\' letters an\\'\\r\\naddressin\\' circulars in a young broker\\'s office.  I was mighty\\r\\nlittle, but I was mighty good lookin\\'.  I thought he took me for what\\r\\nI could do, but I found out he took me for my looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke quite without emotion, and Dyker, in spite of himself, was\\r\\ninterested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It cost that broker a lot to live,\" she continued; \"so much that he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t afford to get married.  When he\\'d got through with me, after\\r\\na few years, an\\' the baby was dead in the hospital, my people were so\\r\\ndamned respectable that I didn\\'t dare go home to them.  Wall Street\\r\\nhad been plungin\\'; nobody\\'d buy stocks; I couldn\\'t get a job there.\\r\\nTimes was hard and I couldn\\'t find a place anywhere else.  It was up\\r\\nto me to starve to death, go into a home an\\' be marked for life, or\\r\\nget real money the best way I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and Wesley found himself interjecting an urging \"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I got the money.  My broker put me up in a flat.  He stole the\\r\\ncash to do it, an\\' when the fly-cops got next, he blew out his\\r\\nbrains.  I was still high and dry, so I got a couple of girls to help\\r\\nme.  Then I met Mike O\\'Malley\\'s brother--the one that\\'s dead now--an\\'\\r\\nhe squared things for me so\\'s I could open up the place you knew.  He\\r\\nowned my joint an\\' was right an\\' regular.  He saw to it I wasn\\'t\\r\\nbothered, an\\' we paid for protection an\\' furnished an address when\\r\\nhis brother needed one for voters.  I never had no trouble \\'till\\r\\nO\\'Malley\\'s brother was dead an\\' you queered me with Mike himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is that all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that\\'s all.  It\\'s about what you\\'d learn from any other woman\\r\\nin my line of work.  But I\\'ll tell you one thing: I got my girls\\r\\nhowever I could--a lot of \\'em because your friends brought \\'em, an\\'\\r\\neveryone that was brought that way I paid for, fair an\\' square an\\'\\r\\ngood an\\' heavy; I had to keep the women down because expenses was so\\r\\nhigh; but no man was ever cheated in my place, an\\' no man was ever\\r\\nrobbed with my knowledge.  I may have bad habits of my own, even for\\r\\nmy sort of a life; but I always treat my customers on the level, an\\'\\r\\nI always see that my girls treat \\'em on the level, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What about the hangers-on?\" asked Wesley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean about Angel?  Well, I played double because I didn\\'t know\\r\\nwho was goin\\' to be on top, an\\' in this business you\\'ve always got to\\r\\nbe on the winnin\\' side.  Now you are on top an\\' there can\\'t be no\\r\\nquestion.  I\\'m in this line because I\\'ve got to live; I couldn\\'t do\\r\\nnothin\\' else; an\\' I\\'m goin\\' to keep on in it as long as I live.  You\\r\\nsee now that I\\'ve always been on the level in one way; you see that I\\r\\nhaven\\'t no reason now not to be on the level in the other way.--Will\\r\\nyou go an\\' fix it with O\\'Malley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did fix it.  He fixed it that afternoon, and he fixed it so firmly\\r\\nthat, within ten days, Rose, with her former minions gathered from\\r\\nthe corners where she had hidden them, was living and prospering in\\r\\nthe house that Riley had raided.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpartial Justice had been satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SANCTITY OF THE HOME\\r\\n\\r\\nDestiny, busy as she had been with the affairs of Rose Légère, had\\r\\nnot neglected the usually serene residence of Mrs. Ferdinand Wapping\\r\\nChamberlin.  For ten hours the invalid herself had been fretful.\\r\\nThis had reacted upon the gentle nature of Mistress Madelaine, who\\r\\nhad in turn made the nurse to suffer, and the nurse, in her own\\r\\nphrase, had \"taken it out on\" Lena Johnson, the Swedish cook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' it\\'s all ban because that son of another husband ban comin\\'\\r\\nhome,\" said the naturally good-tempered Lena, in an effort to pass\\r\\nalong the general discontent to Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What of that?\" Violet asked.  \"Is he home so seldom that we\\'ve got\\r\\nto get the whole house ready for him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared from Lena\\'s answer that the young man was home far more\\r\\nfrequently than his mother\\'s finances could well afford.  When he\\r\\nhonored the Chamberlin roof with his presence, he generally managed\\r\\nto secure all the money within reach and to devote that money to\\r\\nsociological researches that kept him out until the lesser hours of\\r\\nthe morning.  These stubborn pursuits were, it seemed, highly\\r\\ndisapproved of by both his mother and his sister, yet both his mother\\r\\nand his sister hated his father, the divorced husband of the\\r\\nremarried Mrs. Chamberlin; and as the son and brother constantly\\r\\nthreatened that any interference would result in a transfer of his\\r\\naffectionate borrowings to the bank-account of his sire, both women\\r\\nwere, during his intermittent residence with them, torn between their\\r\\nimprobation of his pursuits and their fear that he would desert the\\r\\nmaternal house for the paternal club.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s his name?\" asked Violet, as she lent a hand at the\\r\\npreparation of dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philip,\" answered Lena, \"an\\' it ought to be Hungry Haakon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, when the prodigal reached the house that evening and,\\r\\nadmitting himself with his own latchkey, hurried into the library\\r\\nwhere his mother and sister, the former on the couch and the latter\\r\\nseated beside it, were awaiting the announcement that dinner was\\r\\nserved, he would not have appeared, to any stranger that could see\\r\\nhim, a much worse young man than most young men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" he cried, kissing both women lightly on the cheek.  \"Sister\\r\\nmore of a lure for susceptible hearts than ever!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much chance _I_ have!\" murmured black-eyed Madelaine, brushing aside\\r\\na careful blonde curl disordered by his onslaught.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the _Mutter_ getting better every day,\" pursued the unabashed\\r\\nyouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your mother,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, her heavy brows rising almost to\\r\\nthe level of her lace cap, \"will never be herself again, and you well\\r\\nknow it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poof!  A lean horse for a long race, _Mutter_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Chamberlin waved a thin hand in dismissal of all discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean to dress for dinner,\" she said, \"you had better begin,\\r\\nPhilip.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No use.  I have an engagement for to-night in circles where evening\\r\\nclothes are rarely considered quite proper, and I washed up at the\\r\\nclub.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, then you stopped there before coming to your home?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was on my way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you of course saw that terrible man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis being the term in which Mrs. Chamberlin habitually referred to\\r\\nthe husband that had been so wicked as to permit her, after her\\r\\nelopement with Chamberlin, to institute and win a suit for divorce,\\r\\nher son merely nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what\\'s the use of bothering about that?\" he demanded.  \"It was\\r\\non the way, I tell you.  Cheer up: one may smile and smile and be a\\r\\nwoman still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his hearers, by way of response to this advice, sighed audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think it was very considerate of you, Philip,\" vouchsafed\\r\\nthe younger.  \"You must remember that when you got that last check\\r\\nfrom mother----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madelaine!\" cautioned Mrs. Chamberlin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care, dear.  Philip, you must remember that when you got\\r\\nthat last check from mother, it was on your distinct promise that you\\r\\nwould not see your father again for a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And don\\'t you remember,\" retorted Philip, \"that I afterwards, upon\\r\\nreflection, distinctly withdrew that distinct promise as utterly and\\r\\nin essence unfilial?  A woman can always remember more things than a\\r\\nman has forgotten, and forget whatever she doesn\\'t want to remember.\\r\\nIf it had been an honest woman instead of an honest man that Diogenes\\r\\nwas looking for, he\\'d have had to throw away his lantern and hire a\\r\\nportable lighthouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he kissed the girl as he said this, and pressed his mother\\'s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The trouble with you two,\" he declared, \"is that you don\\'t get about\\r\\nenough.  Seclusion makes you serious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, \"that you had brought me back the\\r\\nnews that you had grown more like us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More serious?  Still harping on your son, dear!  No, I\\'m sorry to\\r\\ndisappoint you, but I\\'ve about given up all hope of marrying money,\\r\\nand marrying anything else is an impossibility.  I must be getting on\\r\\nin years.  You know how it is: as we grow older we become more\\r\\nparticular and less desirable--when we\\'re old enough to have learned\\r\\nproperly to play the game of love, we\\'re too old to play it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a mere boy,\" observed Madelaine, with a toss of her blonde\\r\\ncurls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you talk like one,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, smiling in spite of\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d never think of accepting anybody so young as you are,\" the girl\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip pulled her pink ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Queen Mab,\" he agreed; \"wait till a man is large and\\r\\nround and settled.  And when you do marry, marry for keeps: a little\\r\\nmarriage is a dangerous thing, eh, _Mutter_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philip!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat more she would have said to this criticism of her own estate,\\r\\nMrs. Chamberlin\\'s son was not just then to hear, for a Japanese gong\\r\\ninterrupted her with the melodious announcement of dinner, and the\\r\\nson snatched his protesting mother in his arms and, with Madelaine\\r\\nfollowing, bore her into the brightly lighted dining-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at the shining silver and gleaming linen and glass and\\r\\nchina, and he saw the pale liquid that filled one of the glasses at\\r\\nhis own accustomed place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good!\" he cried.  \"I hope Lena\\'s hand has not forgotten its cunning.\\r\\nStolen waters are sweet, but the best cocktail is a dry one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, with his living burden still in his strong arms, he looked\\r\\nacross the table and into the eyes of the new servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new servant, from the shadow, returned that gaze.  She saw before\\r\\nher, in the person of her employer\\'s son, Philip Beekman, the\\r\\nblack-haired, gray-eyed young waster that had once promised her help\\r\\nin the house of Rose Légère.  On her part, Violet could have no\\r\\ndoubt, and it was only with the utmost exercise of self-control that\\r\\nshe continued her duties.  But for Philip certainty was not\\r\\nimmediately obtainable.  He saw many girls in the surroundings in\\r\\nwhich he had first seen Violet, and her he would probably long since\\r\\nhave forgotten had it not been for the appeal that she had made to\\r\\nhis surface emotions.  Nevertheless, the walls of his own home did\\r\\nnot, in this case, form a setting that made for easy identification,\\r\\nand, besides, though this woman had recovered some degree of her\\r\\nhealth, the best of her looks would never return.  Beauty is the\\r\\nquality most remembered by such men as Philip Beekman, and beauty\\r\\nlost is the best disguise against them.  Philip, therefore, quietly\\r\\ndeposited his mother in her chair, and continued his easy raillery\\r\\nuntil the soup had been served and the little family had been left,\\r\\nfor a time, alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"New maid?\" he then casually inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, \"and actually a fairly competent one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s her name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bella.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, I don\\'t recall her family name, Philip.  What possible\\r\\ndifference can it make?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" said Madelaine, \"that he thinks her pallor interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense, Madelaine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her last name is Nimick, Philip.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Philip, inwardly reflecting that, in the nature of things,\\r\\na name could not much signify.  \"I was merely attracted by the fact\\r\\nthat she didn\\'t precisely resemble a servant.  Have you never noticed\\r\\nhow all men look as if they belonged to the class below their own,\\r\\nand all women to the class above?  It seems as if a man could never\\r\\nrise above his environment, and as if a woman could never descend to\\r\\nhers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not again refer to the subject, but the subject was, during\\r\\nall the meal, keenly conscious that his gray eyes were covertly\\r\\nwatching her.  She moved about the room with increasing difficulty.\\r\\nHer hand shook as she brought the salad-bowl, and she spilled some of\\r\\nhis coffee on the cloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Lena had left the kitchen and gone upstairs, Beekman came\\r\\ninto the pantry.  His manner, neither that which she had once known\\r\\nnor that which she had more lately observed, was quick and\\r\\nthreatening; his frank face was flushed with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your name is Violet,\" he said in a voice that, though low, shook\\r\\nunder the restraint that he put upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was standing beneath a gas-jet, a little column of dishes in her\\r\\nhand.  The cruel light showed the havoc that had been wrought upon\\r\\nher, but it also showed the marks that no years or change could alter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she said, her own voice scarce a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you----\" he bit his lip.  \"Did you come here to scare me?\" he\\r\\ndemanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put down the dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Beekman?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I haven\\'t any money, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Beekman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her hand before her face, and he saw that he had been wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he sulkily said.  \"In the circumstances, it\\r\\nwasn\\'t an unnatural supposition, though my mother thoroughly\\r\\nunderstands my manner of life; but I see now that I shouldn\\'t have\\r\\nsaid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, and then, because he hated to be in the wrong, he hunted\\r\\nabout for another excuse for attack, and, finding one, became more\\r\\nangry than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only how dared you,\" he asked, \"how did you dare to come into this\\r\\nhouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet bowed her russet head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t know it was yours,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You didn\\'t know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I?  Lena didn\\'t happen to say nothin\\' about you before\\r\\nto-day, an\\' your mother has a different name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk of my mother!\" he commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Violet known all the truth of her mistress, it would probably\\r\\nhave flashed over even the servant\\'s dull brain that the difference\\r\\nbetween a woman beaten into slavery and a woman that married the man\\r\\nwho, during her first marriage, had been her lover, was a difference\\r\\nnot of kind, but of degree, and of a degree decidedly in the ethical\\r\\nfavor of the former.  However, she held her tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the best shield she could have chosen.  Through silence few\\r\\nfits of anger are strong enough to reach, and the quick temper of\\r\\nBeekman began slowly to spend itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see how you could come into any decent house,\" he grumbled,\\r\\n\"no matter whether you knew whose it was or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Violet did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you didn\\'t think about that, though,\" Philip pursued.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet was as yet too stunned at all adequately to feel.  With a\\r\\nshaking finger she drew invisible arabesques upon the shelf beside\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you get away from Rose\\'s, anyhow?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly she raised her head.  Slowly she fixed him with her tired blue\\r\\neyes.  And slowly, still drawing arabesques now unregarded, she\\r\\nanswered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that make much difference, Mr. Beekman?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wasn\\'t I interested?\" he blustered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, you see,\" she concluded, \"however it was, it wasn\\'t by none\\r\\nof the help you promised.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thrust just pierced his armor of convention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well,\" he said, \"what could I do?  I wanted to help--you know\\r\\nthat--but what could I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothin\\'!\"  Her eyes clouded as if they looked at something which,\\r\\nthough clear to sight, passed all explaining.  \"Nothin\\', I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words lent him courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can\\'t do anything now,\" he went on, his anger cold, but his\\r\\ndetermination unchanged.  \"I\\'m sorry for you--on my word of honor, I\\r\\nam sorry for you with my whole heart, Violet--but you can\\'t stay\\r\\nhere--you must see that you can\\'t stay in this house another night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes were still on his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you think that,\" she replied, as if puzzled and seeking a\\r\\nsolution.  \"An\\' I know what you think goes.--But, myself, I can\\'t see\\r\\nwhy not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Violet, just consider!\" he cried, his hands outstretched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wanted me to get away an\\' get a decent job,\" she dully answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the difference?  What\\'s the difference whether it\\'s here or\\r\\nsomewheres else?  I can\\'t see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But here all the time I should know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you know, wherever you are, about lots of others that don\\'t\\r\\nget away?  An\\' does that hurt you?  Wouldn\\'t you know about me\\r\\nwherever you are, about me wherever I went?  An\\' would that hurt me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t understand!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to charge her with her admitted incomprehension as if it\\r\\nwere a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you see that if you were somewhere else, it would be\\r\\ndifferent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not if you were where nobody knew about you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t see that, Mr. Beekman.  I haven\\'t got any disease to\\r\\ngive people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wasn\\'t thinking that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you wouldn\\'t tell on me to the people I went to if I went\\r\\nsomewheres else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly I wouldn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' you don\\'t think I\\'d steal, do you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor--nor get anybody who was kind to me into the sort of a hell I\\r\\nworked so hard to get myself out of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I think it?  What are you driving at, Violet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This: that if all them things is the way you say, I\\'m fit for any\\r\\njob I\\'m able to do--an\\' I\\'m able to do this one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in this house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the difference where?\"  Her voice was still low, and her\\r\\nwords still came slowly; but she was, however imperfectly and\\r\\npainfully, beginning to think--which is a very dangerous thing in any\\r\\nexploited individual.  \"What\\'s the difference where?\" she asked.\\r\\n\"What you know don\\'t make me no worse, an\\' what I know don\\'t make me\\r\\nno better.  The truth\\'s the truth.  What\\'s happened\\'s happened.  I\\r\\nused to be a girl in Rose\\'s house, no matter if I was now workin\\' in\\r\\nyour house an\\' you do know what I used to be.  Wherever I am, I\\'m\\r\\nwhat I am; your knowin\\' it don\\'t help or hinder; an\\' if I\\'m fit for\\r\\nnext door I\\'m fit for here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip Beekman passed his long fingers through his black hair.  It\\r\\nwas the gesture she had seen him employ on that remembered night at\\r\\nRose\\'s, but now it had a new significance.  The young man was as much\\r\\nthe creature of his surroundings as Violet was the creation of hers.\\r\\nHe could no more appreciate her point of view than she could\\r\\ncomprehend his.  It was as if they spoke different tongues.  Beekman\\r\\nwas powerless to argue further, and when a man reaches that\\r\\ncondition, he takes a firm stand upon authority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said; \"we won\\'t waste words.  The hard fact is that\\r\\nyou\\'ve got to go.  I\\'m sorry, but you\\'ve got to go and go now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bowed her head; she had finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wished she would answer; he wished she would fly into a rage; but\\r\\nas she remained dumb, he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose your hat and jacket are in the kitchen.  You can drop me a\\r\\ncard telling me where to send your trunk.  I\\'ll explain this to\\r\\nyour--to my mother somehow.  I\\'ll do whatever I can for you--outside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA slow shake of her russet head was her reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll give you a recommendation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t need none, Mr. Beekman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I think I\\'ve got fifty dollars somewhere in my clothes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was paid my wages only this mornin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her in gray-eyed amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I say,\" he began, \"you aren\\'t going to--you don\\'t mean you\\r\\nwon\\'t----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not answer.  She moved slowly and quietly away.  She went to\\r\\nthe kitchen, got her shabby beaver hat and her long coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip, in the pantry, remained as she had left him, erect, eyes and\\r\\nmouth wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later he heard the area door open and close.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXI\\r\\n\\r\\nAN ANCIENT PROBLEM\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An twent\\' from Rosie Légère\\'s,\" said Angel, \"maka two hundre\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann Hoffmann, alone behind the bar in Schleger\\'s saloon, and half\\r\\nasleep as he bent over a thumbed and stained copy of the last\\r\\nevening\\'s paper, scarcely raised his head.  It was half-past one\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning.  Except for Angelelli and the man to whom he\\r\\nwas talking at a table by the door, the place was empty of customers,\\r\\nand so unconcerned were these two late-comers that, had he wished it,\\r\\nevery word of their conversation could have been taken down by the\\r\\nbar-keeper.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the bar-keeper did not wish it.  He knew both the men, and had\\r\\nheard something of the character of each, as every good bar-keeper\\r\\ncomes to know and to hear about most of the regular patrons of the\\r\\nestablishment that employs him.  With Angel he had even had a nodding\\r\\nacquaintance in the days of the brewery-wagon, and since he had\\r\\ndonned the white jacket he had seen often the narrow-chested,\\r\\nstoop-shouldered, slouching Austrian now in conference with the\\r\\ndapper Rafael.  He had been told that this Austrian, with his\\r\\nbristling brown hair, pale face, and thin mouth, pulled downward at\\r\\none corner by an ugly scar, made his regular living by appropriating\\r\\nthe wages of a girl that he nightly drove forth to scour the dark\\r\\nstreets, earning what money she could from what looks were left her\\r\\nand stealing what she could not earn.  And Hermann knew that, now an\\r\\nelection was near, both of these proud possessors of the suffrage\\r\\nwere doing their exacted duty for the powers that permitted them to\\r\\nthrive, and were, like the army of others in their own profession,\\r\\nthrough all New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, through the\\r\\ntenderloin of every American city, providing for the voting of\\r\\nrepeaters, of dead men, of men that never were, in the interests of\\r\\nwhichever of the two great political parties happens to be in control\\r\\nof the city where such votes are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mirka,\" said Angel, laying down his gold-rimmed fountain-pen and\\r\\nlooking up from the back of the envelope on which he had been making\\r\\nhis calculations, \"we weell need a hundre\\' more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMirka, the Austrian, tried to smile, but that ugly scar at the corner\\r\\nof his mouth caught the smile in the making and pulled it down into a\\r\\nsinister sneer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can smoke out fifty if you can,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Da sama kind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann, behind the bar, frankly yawned.  He remembered, with a slow\\r\\nsmile, how, when he had first come across such practices, years ago,\\r\\nhe had gone to the ward-leader of that party in whose interests the\\r\\nwork was being done.  He remembered how this potentate had first\\r\\nassured him that he had \"heard wrong,\" and finally met his\\r\\npersistence with a warning that he had better keep his mouth shut.\\r\\nHe remembered how, at the rival headquarters, he had been told that\\r\\nthere was always a mass of such evidence, none of which could be\\r\\neffectively used before election, and how, when he had ventured to\\r\\nsuggest that an election-offense was punishable after election-day,\\r\\nhe had been ridiculed.  And lastly, he knew that his own Socialist\\r\\nfriends had already all the information that he had now obtained, but\\r\\ncould do no more at the polls than lodge protests that would be\\r\\noverruled by the election-judges and subsequently pigeon-holed by the\\r\\ncourts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" Angel was saying, as he pocketed his pen and tore the\\r\\nenvelope into small bits, which he tossed deftly across the room into\\r\\nthe gutter beneath the bar.  \"I feexa heem.  I geta da rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men rose and stepped to the bar for a nightcap of whiskey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready the Austrian had drunk more than was good for his temper, but\\r\\nHermann, whose eye was usually exact in discerning such matters, was\\r\\nsleepy to-night, and did not notice this.  Angel poured a bountiful\\r\\nportion from the cool metal-stoppered bottle that Hoffmann shoved\\r\\nclanking toward him.  Mirka decanted even more, and then momentarily\\r\\nreleased his hold of the bottle to speak to his companion.  Hermann,\\r\\nthinking both men satisfied, reached for the liquor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Keep your dirty fingers off of that!\" cried Mirka, with no trace of\\r\\nhis nationality in his speech.  \"Can\\'t you wait till I pour a real\\r\\nman\\'s drink?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a bath, den, you\\'re goin\\' to dake?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will if I like, you damned fool!\" rejoined Mirka, his eyes warming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann\\'s blue glance surveyed the uncouth, slouching figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All righd,\" he said; \"you need von.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian glowered.  Then, tilting back his bristling head, he\\r\\ntossed the liquor down his long throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me another, you Dutchie,\" he ordered, pushing his glass across\\r\\nthe bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel began a quieting word, but Mirka broke in, still addressing\\r\\nHermann.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get a move on, or I\\'ll break yer face, Dutchie!\" he insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann\\'s jaw was suddenly set in a rigid line.  He remained\\r\\nmotionless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on, now!\" said Mirka.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\' maka these treecks,\" protested Angelelli, dividing his plea\\r\\nbetween his hearers, and placing his hand upon the Austrian\\'s\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shut up!\" retorted Mirka, shaking himself free.  \"And you, you\\r\\nDutch fool, give me a drink--quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann did not obey.  He saw at last the fellow\\'s condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve had enough,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind yer own business,\" snapped the Austrian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dot\\'s what I\\'m doing,\" answered Hermann, calmly reaching for the\\r\\nempty glasses.  \"You\\'re drunk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly spoken before Mirka, his habitual lassitude dropping\\r\\nfrom him like a discarded cloak, made a quick leap that brought him\\r\\nhalf across the bar.  The glasses crashed, the bottle was overturned,\\r\\nand in the Austrian\\'s waving, clenched right hand there flashed a\\r\\nknife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a moment of action, but a moment only.  From one side of the\\r\\nbar, Angel had gripped Mirka by the waist and was pulling him\\r\\nbackward; on the other, the powerful German had caught the\\r\\nthreatening fist and now, with a quick twist, sent the knife plunging\\r\\ninto the tub below the beer-spigots.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpluttering obscenities, the Austrian was dragged to the position\\r\\nfrom which he had made his attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You keepa quiet!\" commanded Angel of the one combatant, and to the\\r\\nother: \"You getta more fresh with your mouth an\\' I getta you fired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann had recovered the knife and was now calmly drying it upon a\\r\\nbar-towel.  Such incidents were not unusual in his occupation and,\\r\\nnow that this one was closed, he could afford to smile his answer to\\r\\nRafael.\\r\\n\\r\\nMirka, on the other hand, though still tightly embraced by Angel, was\\r\\ntrembling with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll get you for this, Dutchie!\" he declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So?\" said Hermann.  He still smiled, but he was tired of being\\r\\ncalled Dutchie, and his tongue ran just a hair\\'s breadth ahead of his\\r\\ncaution.  \"Try it,\" he concluded; \"try it, you dirty Austrian loafer,\\r\\nund I\\'ll somevheres go vhere dose names you\\'ve been makin\\' oud vill\\r\\nget you vhat you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whata you say?\" Angel kept his hold upon his friend, but the\\r\\nreference to their recent occupation brought a glint of anger into\\r\\nhis own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of beginning his reply, Hermann smilingly returned the knife\\r\\nto its owner, who seized it with a growl of malice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neffer mind vhat I say den,\" he answered.  \"Vhat I say now is\\r\\n\\'Goot-nighd.\\'  You two get oud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his thick arm to point to the door, but in the manner of\\r\\nits raising there was another significance.  For a moment Angel and\\r\\nMirka met hotly his steady gaze.  Then the bar-keeper raised\\r\\ncarelessly his other hand: it held a stout bung-starter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men, with a common impulse, turned and silently left the\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann was not afraid of them.  He knew that his threat of betrayal\\r\\nhad been idle, for the excellent reason that there was no quarter in\\r\\nwhich betrayal would be effective, and he told himself that, as soon\\r\\nas their anger and their drunkenness had in some measure subsided,\\r\\nthe plotters would recognize this.  So he whistled complacently as he\\r\\npolished the bright surface of the bar and did not hesitate, when he\\r\\nbegan at last to wash and put away the glasses, to turn his back to\\r\\nthe swinging door of the saloon.  The campaign was not one that was\\r\\nconsidered important and, personally, he cared but little about it or\\r\\nwhat enmities it might awaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaigners cared, however, a great deal.  There was in no sane\\r\\nmind any question of the result, but so mighty is custom that there\\r\\nwere few sane minds that did not publicly pretend to be in doubt upon\\r\\nthe issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many days previously, any outsider, reading the newspapers or\\r\\nattending the mass-meetings in Cooper Union and Carnegie Hall, would\\r\\nhave supposed that a prodigious battle was waging and that the result\\r\\nwould be, until the last shot, in doubt.  There were terrible\\r\\nscareheads, brutal cartoons, and extra editions.  As the real problem\\r\\nwas whether one organization of needy men should remain in control,\\r\\nor whether another should replace it, there were few matters of\\r\\npolicy to be discussed; and so the speechmaking and the printing\\r\\nresolved themselves into personal investigations, and attacks upon\\r\\ncharacter.  Private defectives were hired, records searched,\\r\\nneighbors questioned, old enemies sought out, and family feuds\\r\\nrevived.  Desks were broken open, letters bought, anonymous\\r\\ncommunications mailed, boyhood indiscretions unearthed, and women and\\r\\nmen hired to wheedle, to commit perjury, to entrap.  Whatever was\\r\\ndiscovered, forged, stolen, manufactured--whatever truth or falsehood\\r\\ncould be seized by whatever means--was blazoned in the papers,\\r\\nshrieked by the newsboys, bawled from the cart-tails at the corners\\r\\nunder the campaign banners, in the light of the torches and before\\r\\nthe cheering crowds.  It would all be over in a very short while; in\\r\\na very short while there would pass one another, with pleasant\\r\\nsmiles, in court, at church, and along Broadway, the distinguished\\r\\ngentlemen that were now, before big audiences, calling one another\\r\\nadulterers and thieves; but it is customary for distinguished\\r\\ngentlemen so to call one another during a manly campaign in this\\r\\nsuccessful democracy of ours, and it seems to be an engrossing\\r\\noccupation while the chance endures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he often trembled, Wesley Dyker, perhaps because his records\\r\\nof any sort were as yet but brief, escaped with a fairly clean skin\\r\\nthis Yahoo discharge, but the downpour continued all about him with\\r\\ntremendous vigor and at tremendous cost.  The Republican leaders,\\r\\nfully expecting defeat, assessed their supporters just as heavily as\\r\\nif they were certain to triumph, spent much time and more money and\\r\\nno end of breath.  The Reformers, under varying factional names,\\r\\nbewildered, sometimes advisedly, the independent voter by here\\r\\njoining one leading party, there endorsing another, and in a third\\r\\nplace clamoring for a ballot so split and so subdivided that the\\r\\naverage man could in no wise comprehend it when marked.  The\\r\\nSocialists, to be sure, went along calmly enough, confessing their\\r\\nnumerical weakness and securely seeing in the small increase of the\\r\\npresent day the promise of the large majority of the distant morrow.\\r\\nBut all the while the Democratic organization thundered an inch\\r\\nforward in the light and ran a mile forward in the darkness by\\r\\nprecisely the same powers as were invoked, with so much smaller\\r\\nresults, by the Republicans and the Reformers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that there was any reason to doubt the organization\\'s victory.\\r\\nThere was none.  But every organization always insists that, no\\r\\nmatter how easy the skirmish, its leaders must so manage that it\\r\\ncomes out of the fray to all appearances stronger than it came out of\\r\\nthe fray preceding.  Each majority must be larger than the last, and\\r\\nso the lists are padded, and the repeaters imported, and the\\r\\nlodging-houses colonized, and the organization, like the frog in La\\r\\nFontaine\\'s fable, though with less reason, swells and swells against\\r\\nthe hour when it shall finally burst.  The saloons were crowded; it\\r\\nwas freely predicted that, the season being prosperous, votes would\\r\\ngo at no lower than two dollars, and, in some quarters and some\\r\\ninstances, as high as five dollars apiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some points, however, to which the tide of prosperity had\\r\\nnot risen, and one of these was the high tenement of Katie Flanagan.\\r\\nThe Irish girl returned there every night a little more discouraged\\r\\nthan when she had left its precarious shelter in the morning, as\\r\\ndoubtful as ever of Hermann\\'s ability to support a wife, but more\\r\\ndoubtful than ever of her own ability to help, should they marry, in\\r\\nthe support of the home.  At the shop, the work and the hours weighed\\r\\nmore and more heavily upon her; they dragged at the heels of her mind\\r\\nwhen she endeavored to evade the insulting compliments of the callow\\r\\nyouths and gray men that strolled by her counter, and they were\\r\\nimpedimenta that made it daily more difficult to escape without\\r\\noffense the oily approaches of the dignified Mr. Porter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes,\" she said one evening, as she and Carrie sat over their\\r\\nmeager supper, \"I begin wonderin\\' again whether it\\'s worth while\\r\\nrunnin\\' away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe striking shirtwaist-maker, who had spent a long day on\\r\\npicket-duty before a Waverley Place factory, looked up with round\\r\\neyes calmly serious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what I am wondering all the time,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie made an impatient movement of her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Och, now,\" she generously protested, \"it\\'s all right for me to\\r\\ngrowl, because I\\'ve got a job.  I don\\'t count, an\\' it\\'s just me\\r\\nhabit.  But you mustn\\'t do it, me dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not complaining; I am just honestly wondering, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if the worst came, you could go back to work, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie\\'s face was all surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And turn traitor to my friends striking in my own and all the other\\r\\nfactories?\" she asked.  \"Oh, no; you would be the last to do it\\r\\nyourself, Katie.  I would rather go on the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean that, darlin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do mean it.  If I went on the street, I would hurt myself, but if\\r\\nI did the other thing I would hurt all the other girls in the union.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke quietly, but with infinite conviction, and Katie knew the\\r\\nforces that had brought about this state of mind.  The widespread\\r\\nstrike, though it still continued, was a failure.  Public sentiment\\r\\nhad never been aroused; the employers had succeeded in securing\\r\\nnon-union labor, whose wages they were, even now, securely reducing,\\r\\nand whose privileges--granted to entice them to work--they were\\r\\ncurbing; their political powers earned them the armed assistance of\\r\\nthe law; and the strikers\\' ranks, though but little thinned by\\r\\ndesertion, were steadily decreased by poverty, by the necessity of\\r\\nthe girls to find other sorts of work, by illness, and, now that the\\r\\ncold autumn had set in, by death.  Carrie was underfed, scantily\\r\\nclothed, penniless, and Katie, remembering these things, found\\r\\nherself without reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she needed further example of the pressure of conditions upon her\\r\\nkind, she could have found it in an incident in the shop on the day\\r\\nfollowing.  A bull-necked young man, with ruddy cheeks and a\\r\\ncertainty of manner that spoke as loudly in his eyes and his\\r\\nscarf-pin as in his voice, sauntered up to the silk-stocking counter,\\r\\nwhere she happened then to be stationed, and began turning over the\\r\\nwares displayed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you been waited on?\" inquired Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the young man, looking at her steadily; \"but I\\'d like you\\r\\nto wait on me.  Are you busy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie said nothing, but stood there.  The young man said nothing.\\r\\nKatie began to finger the boxes before her, but she felt that the\\r\\nyoung man was looking only at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What quality would you like me to show you?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" parried the customer, \"what quality do you like?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shot one glance at him: he was still looking at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have only the best at this counter,\" she answered, with a slight\\r\\nflush.  \"You\\'ll be findin\\' the cheaper the sixth aisle to your right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the young man only laughed with unconcern, and continued to keep\\r\\nhis gaze on her lowered Irish blue eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can afford the best of everything,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a pause.  Katie raised her eyes and met his own without\\r\\nflinching.  He smiled, but he was quite too satisfied with his own\\r\\ncharms to notice that the salesgirl was not smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What time do you quit work?\" he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never quit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said this as if she were closing a door, but the young man\\r\\nproceeded imperturbably to rattle at the knob.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought,\" he said, \"that you might like to eat a little dinner\\r\\nover at the \\'York\\' with me this evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" the girl answered, \"but I do all me eatin\\' with me\\r\\nhusband.--Will you, please, be tellin\\' me what sort of stockin\\'s you\\r\\nwant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man grinned.  He seemed to enjoy what he took to be her\\r\\nplayful repartee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" he replied, \"my wife is away back home, and I\\'m all\\r\\nalone over at that hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was leaning airily toward her, both hands on the counter.  Katie,\\r\\nstanding opposite, leaned toward him.  She answered his smile, but he\\r\\ncould not see that her smile was not of his own sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you want to buy anything?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the customer, meeting her gaze again.  \"Will you sell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no unusual incident, no more unusual than the coming incident\\r\\nof Mirka\\'s attack upon Hermann, but the girl had reached the end of\\r\\nher endurance, and what followed across that counter was not unlike\\r\\nwhat was to occur across Ludwig Schleger\\'s bar.  Katie opened her\\r\\nfirm, pink palm and smacked the young bargain-seeker smartly across\\r\\nthe mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no immediate consequence.  The aisle was too crowded to\\r\\nallow any but the nearest employees to witness the blow, and the\\r\\ncrowd was too intent upon its own thousand errands to heed what\\r\\nhappened before its eyes.  One or two salesgirls stood still at their\\r\\nwork, petrified by alarm.  One or two customers hesitated and\\r\\nchuckled.  And then, as the young man with a face of crimson\\r\\nshouldered his way into a hurried oblivion from which he never\\r\\nreappeared, the rush of business sent the clerks whirling about their\\r\\nown tasks and sent the crowd hurrying about its own purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Katie knew that more would follow, and that what would follow\\r\\nwould be an interview with Mr. Porter.  The shop\\'s system of\\r\\nsurveillance missed nothing, and within a half-hour the girl was\\r\\nstanding in the dark office where she had first been hired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his likeness to a Sunday-school superintendent Mr. Porter was\\r\\nshocked and grieved to hear that any young lady in the Lennox store\\r\\nwould strike a purchaser.  In his likeness to a surgeon he promptly\\r\\ndeclared that there ought to be no issue short of expulsion.  And in\\r\\nhis own hidden character--deep in his own abominable character--he\\r\\nwas wondering whether he could not turn this incident to the\\r\\nadvantage that he had so long sought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The viper was insultin\\' me,\" said Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure of that, Miss Flanagan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure I\\'m sure.  Do you have to wait for a snake to bite you before\\r\\nyou know what he\\'s up to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could have called the floor-walker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And been fined for me pains, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter tapped his desk and kept his eyes on his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I find,\" he said slowly, \"that most men do not make approaches\\r\\nwithout some encouragement, in either word or manner, on the part of\\r\\nthe girl.  I also find that such occurrences as this are very rare in\\r\\nthe experience of most of the girls in our employ.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped, but Katie stood silent by the arm of the desk, her lips\\r\\ncompressed, a frown between her arched black brows.  He sent a\\r\\ncrooked glance up at her, and then resumed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I scarcely ever have a case of this sort to deal with.  I wonder\\r\\nwhy, if such things are done by customers, the other girls do not\\r\\nreport them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped again, and this time Katie answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose they boss their own lives in their own way, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA faint spark of color shone in Mr. Porter\\'s white cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose they do,\" he answered, gently pulling at his\\r\\nside-whiskers, and peeping at his victim over the caressing hand.\\r\\n\"In fact, between you and me, Miss Flanagan, I am told that some of\\r\\nthem do that so well that they are practically independent of their\\r\\nwages in this store.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Katie failed to respond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you understand me, Miss Flanagan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie thought of her desperate days before she had found her present\\r\\nemployment.  She thought of Hermann and what seemed to be the sole\\r\\nchance of rising to a salary where marriage could be a practical\\r\\npossibility.  She thought of Carrie\\'s plight and of Carrie\\'s\\r\\ndependence upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do that, Mr. Porter,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked up squarely then, and she even managed to torture her face\\r\\ninto an expression of roguery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Porter, smiling a paternal smile.  He reached out and\\r\\npatted her hand, and, though her soul revolted, she managed to keep\\r\\nher hand passive.  \"Now, my dear young lady, you are at last coming\\r\\nto your senses.  You mustn\\'t take life so seriously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll try not to, Mr. Porter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right; that\\'s right.  I ought to discharge you, I know.  It\\r\\nmay be difficult not to discharge you.  But I will do this much: I\\r\\nwill suspend judgment for a few days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her fixedly.  Her cold lips formed another phrase of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And in the meantime,\" he continued, \"you let me know of some evening\\r\\nwhen you can come out to a quiet corner where we can have supper\\r\\ntogether, and where we won\\'t be wasting the firm\\'s time.  Then we\\'ll\\r\\ntalk this whole thing over, and I\\'ll see what I can do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes of neither wavered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Porter,\" said Katie again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that she left him, but she went away with the knowledge that her\\r\\ngame of hide-and-seek was almost ended.  Just when it would end was\\r\\nbeyond all guessing, but that it would end soon and that it would end\\r\\nin her defiance of her superiors and her prompt expulsion seemed\\r\\naltogether certain.  She reflected that the small delay which she had\\r\\ngained would profit but lightly those in whose interests she had\\r\\nattempted to truckle and palliate, and, when, that night, she told\\r\\nher experience to Carrie, her words fell upon ears that read into\\r\\nthem a portentous meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe homely, brown-haired Lithuanian, whose cheeks were less round now\\r\\nthan they had been, and whose hair that needed no covering in the\\r\\nsummer, was still uncovered, went to her weary picket-duty in\\r\\nWaverley Place the next morning--the morning, as it happened, that\\r\\npreceded Hermann\\'s little brush with Mirka--with a slow step and a\\r\\nheavy heart.  She knew the futility of the work she was performing;\\r\\nshe saw it even in the relaxed vigilance of the policemen on the\\r\\ncorners and in the mocking grins of the girls and toughs at the\\r\\ngloomy factory-door.  All day as, sometimes companioned and sometimes\\r\\nalone, she plodded her eventless round, the irony of the task bit\\r\\ninto her soul.  Something she must do, and soon.  Already she was\\r\\ndeep in Katie\\'s debt, and Katie was near dismissal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early autumn twilight dropped among the grimy buildings.  The\\r\\nevening tide of Broadway rose and roared into Waverley Place.  A cold\\r\\nwind lashed the dust into little whirlpools, wound the girl\\'s cheap\\r\\nlawn skirt tightly about her aching knees, and ate through that thin\\r\\nmaterial to the tingling skin.  There was no one with her now, and\\r\\nshe felt more than ever alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the shadow of a doorway a man crossed the street and approached\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of uncertain age, of almost any age below the early\\r\\nthirties.  As he bowed to her, the girl saw that his hair was dark\\r\\nand curly; that the back of his hand, which was not the hand of a\\r\\nworker, was covered with a black down, and that through the pale\\r\\nolive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks there shone the blue-black\\r\\nbanners of a wiry beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thick\\r\\nuntil they smiled, above white teeth, in greeting, and his gray\\r\\nglance had the character of an appraisement of whatever it looked\\r\\nupon.  Carrie noticed, protruding from his breast-coatpocket, a\\r\\npurple bordered handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him gravely.  She had never seen him before, but with\\r\\nhis kind she had lately grown enough familiar.  Wherever there are\\r\\nwomen on strike, men of his sort gather, as the vultures gather about\\r\\ndying animals in a jungle.  Yet Carrie said nothing.  She was, as she\\r\\nhad expressed it to Katie, still wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been _vatch_in\\' you,\" said the man.  \"I\\'ve been vatchin\\' you\\r\\nall _tay_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you?\"  Carrie was totally incurious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I\\'d think you\\'d be pretty tired of sooch _fool_ishness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am tired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t vin.  If you go back it will be _choost_ the same\\r\\nhell-mill it vas be_fore_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose it would.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell then\"--his hands spread themselves in protest--\"vhy don\\'t you\\r\\n_qvit_?  A pretty, strong girl like you could make _loads_ of money\\r\\nfer herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie was leaning against the factory wall.  She did not move.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell, you hafn\\'t got no _od_der trade, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Und you vouldn\\'t vant to be a _ser_vant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because that\\'s vorse nor a _shirt_vaist-factory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I wouldn\\'t want to be a servant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the man extended his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I knew one girl that went into a house,\" affirmed Carrie, \"and I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t do that for a fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer practical manner might have disconcerted most men, but this man\\'s\\r\\nbusiness had accustomed him to all forms of rejoinder.  He\\r\\nimmediately began an endeavor to persuade her by economic arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Carrie interrupted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she said, \"if I do it, it will be only because I have to, and\\r\\nthen I\\'ll not do it that way.  Thank you, just the same.  Here comes\\r\\nmy relief: I don\\'t have to wait till the girls come out to-day.\\r\\nGood-by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe essayed to protest, but she walked quietly by him, made her brief\\r\\nreport to the oncoming women, and started on her journey homeward.\\r\\nThe man, whose trade imposed patience, said no more.  He did not\\r\\nagain approach her, and, though she knew that he was following her,\\r\\nthrough the growing crowd that rolled eastward, to mark her\\r\\nhiding-place, she did not attempt to elude him.  She was very tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the evening that preceded the early morning call of Angel\\r\\nthe Italian and Mirka the Austrian to Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon, and\\r\\nit was about eight hours later that Hermann, having seen his\\r\\nassailants leave, turned his back to the bar-room door and, alone in\\r\\nthe place, set about washing the discarded glasses.  Except that he\\r\\nwas sleepy, he was in his usual spirits and he was whistling \"Die\\r\\nWacht Am Rhein.\"  He was whistling so loudly that he did not hear the\\r\\ndoor reopen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a flash as of a thousand blinding lights, a roar as if a\\r\\ntrain had fallen from the elevated road overhead, and Hermann, in the\\r\\nsmoke-filled saloon, himself fell crashing behind the bar, and lay\\r\\nthere, huddled and still.\\r\\n\\r\\nMirka quietly reclosed the door and darted around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SERPENTS\\' DEN\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty, which produces the slave, breeds, just as surely, the\\r\\nslaver.  Take where you will the trail of the trafficker in women,\\r\\nthis rule is proven.  It is proven in puritan Boston and protected\\r\\nNew Orleans, in Chicago and Washington, in Philadelphia and San\\r\\nFrancisco, and on the heroic scale it is nowhere more plainly proven\\r\\nthan in the heroic city of New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Manhattan Island is, indeed, the Mother-Church, however\\r\\nunconsciously organized, of the black faith, and though, of\\r\\nnecessity, there spontaneously arise elsewhere congregations that\\r\\nreach back to her, here is founded and established the Congregation\\r\\nof the Propaganda that reaches out to them.  Its missionaries--its\\r\\nwomen, men, and methods--have stretched to Nome and the Canal Zone;\\r\\nthey are preaching their own brand of dogma against the native\\r\\nversions of Buenos Ayres and Sydney, of Shanghai and Cape Town; and\\r\\nwithin its home city the hierarchy is entrenched by financial\\r\\nstrength, political power, and legal negligence.  As an industry, it\\r\\nhas its wholesalers and retailers; or, as a church, its bishops sit\\r\\nin their national house of peers, while its younger orders, its\\r\\nproselyting priests and evangelizing deacons, perform their especial\\r\\ntasks, the young appealing to the young, the poor preying upon\\r\\npoverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance to these lower orders lies, as in most orders and most\\r\\nbusinesses, through a period of probation: the lad of sixteen plays\\r\\nthe rôle of watchdog and spy for his superiors, for which he earns an\\r\\noccasional fifty-cent piece, or a casual kettle of beer, vastly\\r\\nincreasing his income if he now and then diverts, as he generally\\r\\ndoes, his energies to the occupation of amateur theft.  From this\\r\\nstage he is admitted, by his own efforts, to the possession of one\\r\\ngirl, whom he bullies into working for him along the streets.  He may\\r\\noccasionally deign to appear as a waiter in a café, and offer his\\r\\nwoman to its drunken habitués; but most frequently he scorns all\\r\\nmenial labor, for which, in fact, conditions have utterly unfitted\\r\\nhim.  Sometimes he increases his slave-holdings to a trio of women,\\r\\nand even farms out his victims to friends in his own or other\\r\\nneighborhoods or towns: more often he delivers his human wares to the\\r\\nproprietors of houses intended for their reception, being paid in a\\r\\nlump sum, or on a royalty basis; but in either case his ambition is,\\r\\nnaturally, to rise to the position of the large property-holder or\\r\\nthe political receiver of tribute.  If he is an Italian, common\\r\\nconsent limits his operations to the southern end of the Bowery; if\\r\\nhe is a Jew, his field lies about the Houston and Essex Streets\\r\\ndistricts; whatever his European parentage, he seeks his\\r\\nfellow-countrywomen, and if he is American born he has the freedom of\\r\\nBroadway.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis means are multitude.  Wherever there is squalor seeking ease, he\\r\\nis there.  Wherever there is distress crying for succor, discontent\\r\\ncomplaining for relief, weariness sighing for rest, there is this\\r\\nmissionary, this \"cadet,\" offering the quack salvation of his\\r\\ntemporal church.  He knows and takes subtle advantage of the Jewish\\r\\nsisters sent to work for the education of Jewish brothers; the Irish,\\r\\nthe Germans, the Russians, and the Syrians ground in one or another\\r\\neconomic mill; the restless neurotic native-daughters untrained for\\r\\nwork and spoiled for play.  He is at the door of the factory when it\\r\\nreleases its white-faced women for a breath of night air; he is at\\r\\nthe cheap lunch-room where the stenographers bolt unwholesome noonday\\r\\nfood handed about by underpaid waitresses; he lurks around the corner\\r\\nfor the servant and the shop-clerk.  He remembers that these are\\r\\ngirls too tired to do household work in their evenings, too untaught\\r\\nto find continued solace in books; that they must go out, that they\\r\\nmust move about; and so he passes his own nights at the restaurants\\r\\nand theaters, the moving-picture shows, the dancing academies, the\\r\\ndance-halls.  He may go into those stifling rooms where immigrants,\\r\\nlong before they learn to make a half-complete sentence of what they\\r\\ncall the American language, learn what they are told are American\\r\\ndances: the whirling \"spiel\" with blowing skirts, the \"half-time\\r\\nwaltz\" with jerking hips.  He may frequent the more sophisticated\\r\\nforms of these places, may even be seen in the more expensive cafés,\\r\\nor may journey into the provinces.  But he scents poverty from afar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere training is as yet too strong or distress too weak to make\\r\\nserve the offer of partnership, the promise of marriage usually\\r\\nsuffices.  The thing is done, and once done, blows and starvation\\r\\nperpetuate it with the ignorant, and threats of exposure and public\\r\\nshame rivet the shackles on the more knowing.  The former suffer for\\r\\ntheir darkness; the latter are held the faster in proportion to their\\r\\nprevious respectability.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne has said that this church is established; in every city it\\r\\nmaintains its incestuous marriage to the state.  It controls real\\r\\nvotes by the thousands and provides false ones by the tens of\\r\\nthousands.  It is a church that may be considered to exercise the old\\r\\necclesiastical right of trying its own offenders in its own courts.\\r\\nWhen the magistrates have not begun as slavers, when they own no\\r\\npoor, but highly rented, houses, leased for prostitution, when they\\r\\ndo not even accept tithes from the traffic, it is still largely the\\r\\ntraffic that elects and can defeat them.  What the Black Church owes\\r\\nto the political powers for their protection, the political powers\\r\\nowe to the church for its ballots.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was this condition that made possible the impunity of such a deed\\r\\nas the Austrian Mirka had done upon Hermann Hoffmann, the bar-keeper;\\r\\nthat made certain the assailant\\'s escape, and that made of the entire\\r\\nmatter merely a question as to which of several handy means should be\\r\\nemployed to free the slaver in the eyes of the law.  About those\\r\\nmeans there had, however, been some debate, and so it befell that,\\r\\nearly on the Sunday evening following the shooting, Rafael Angelelli\\r\\nsat in a recognized New York meeting-place of the church\\'s\\r\\nproselyting order, engaged in pleasant converse with Wesley Dyker,\\r\\ncandidate for a magistracy.  This place was the back-room of a\\r\\nsaloon.  It was filled with cigarette-smoking young missionaries, who\\r\\ntalked shop, and quoted prices, and discussed the prospects of a good\\r\\nseason in precisely the businesslike way that men in a\\r\\nlivestock-dealers\\' club talk shop, and quote prices, and discuss the\\r\\nprospects of a good season.  Dyker had not at all wanted to come\\r\\nthere, but O\\'Malley had ordered, and so, making peace with the\\r\\ntolerant Angelelli, he had been forced to obey.  A special counsel\\r\\nfor the sheriff of New York had once been a member of the legal corps\\r\\nof the missionaries and so had two State Senators: O\\'Malley,\\r\\nremembering Dyker\\'s previous career, could see no reason for present\\r\\npride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was clouded with smoke.  Waiters hurried about serving beer\\r\\nfrom brass platters and swabbing the small tables with damp rags.\\r\\nThere was a buzz of conversation broken by that peculiar form of\\r\\nlaughter which responds only to obscenities, and now and then, out of\\r\\nthe general clamor, there arose oaths almost technical, descriptions\\r\\nof women that sounded like auctioneers\\' announcements in a\\r\\nhorse-market, and fragments of stories in which the teller bragged of\\r\\na sharp deal he had effected in capturing a slave or in bargaining\\r\\nwith a proprietress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand,\" said Dyker, with his eyelids characteristically\\r\\nlowered, \"that you want to see me in regard to something about this\\r\\nshooting-affair of your friend Mirka.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel\\'s oily head bobbed a ready assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s the fellow that was hurt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Bellevue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he going to die?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw; eet was only a leetle one in hees shoulder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anybody else in the bar when it happened?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was better.  Wesley took a sip of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mirka was alone, too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did the bar-keeper see him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw; hees back was rounda to da door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'d been a quarrel beforehand, though?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, some small word only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And nobody saw Mirka come back or leave the place the second time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody had seen him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen how was it that the injured man, in the hospital, had said that\\r\\nMirka had done the shooting?\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel explained that Hermann based his accusation partly on an\\r\\nuncertain and partial glimpse of Mirka caught in the bar-mirror at\\r\\nthe instant that the shot was fired, but largely on the preceding\\r\\nquarrel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This Hoffmann couldn\\'t swear to Mirka\\'s identity from that mere\\r\\nglimpse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian thought not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said Wesley, \"it all ought to be easy enough.  Every\\r\\nbar-keeper knows a lot of drunks that might want to hurt him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRafael shrugged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can feex eet,\" he said.  \"Meest\\' O\\'Malley say you feex eet easy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" replied Dyker, \"I don\\'t see how I can act as Mirka\\'s lawyer,\\r\\nunless it is all done quickly.  You know, I\\'m about to be elected\\r\\nmagistrate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poof!\" said Angel, blowing a thin spiral of blue cigarette-smoke.\\r\\n\"We gotta da lawyer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\"  Dyker looked up quickly, and quickly down again.  \"Then you\\r\\nwant me--I see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospective magistrate began making rings on the table with his\\r\\nwet glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I should think there were other ways.  The man hasn\\'t been\\r\\narrested yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why need the police find him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thees O\\'Malley say eet looka better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might jump his bail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s often done that way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O\\'Malley say \\'naw\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or he might go up for trial.  There\\'s no real evidence against him:\\r\\nnobody saw the shot fired.  And besides, even if we couldn\\'t fix\\r\\nthings in court, which is always easy enough, we could get him a\\r\\npardon as we did for Pud Morley or Frank Da Silva.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Angel would have none of these propositions.  Michael O\\'Malley\\r\\nwas, it seemed, inexorable.  There had been enough bail-jumping,\\r\\nqueer verdicts, and pardons for a few months.  The case must come\\r\\nbefore the new magistrate, and the new magistrate must declare that\\r\\nthe testimony was not sufficient to warrant holding the prisoner for\\r\\ncourt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Mirka now?\" asked Dyker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Een Philadelph\\',\" said Angel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Loafing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.  He tooka one of heesa girls along.  I am takin\\' care of dees\\r\\nother one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t we get hold of the Dutchman and make him see who\\'s back of all\\r\\nthis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw; dees Dutch\\' ees a fool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t even be bought?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can\\'t be scared?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw; I tell you dees Dutch\\' ees a damn fool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley did not like the plan; he did not like it at all; but he was\\r\\nalready harnessed fast, and he had learned that it was best to follow\\r\\nwithout protest the directing rein.  He achieved a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian\\'s face lighted with gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do eet?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll arrange it; don\\'t worry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good!  Good!  That\\'s good!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel\\'s pleasure was so pronounced that Dyker for a moment\\r\\nfeared--though it would have made small difference--lest the cadet\\r\\nmake to the entire company a public announcement of his promise.  He\\r\\nneed not, however, have worried.  Rafael was wholly used to these\\r\\nlegal fictions and to the etiquette that imposed their formal\\r\\nobservance; his delight took the shape of an order for another pair\\r\\nof drinks, and, those dispatched, he leisurely got upon his little\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I go.  I hava da businesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled wisely at the concluding word.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley also rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll have to be getting along myself,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, but you can stay eef you feel like,\" said Angel.  \"I maka you\\r\\nknow deesa mens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks.  I do know most of them,\" replied Dyker, nodding to two or\\r\\nthree of the nearby cadets as he spoke.  \"But I have some business,\\r\\ntoo.  These are busy times with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both made their way to the saloon\\'s side door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goin\\' so soon?\" chorused some of the habitués as Angel moved among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded, smiling cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goin\\' to kop out a new skirt?\" inquired one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yas,\" responded Rafael, now with a frank, satisfied chuckle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then here\\'s luck!\" cried another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the health was being drunk, Dyker passed through the door and\\r\\nturned, alone, into the cool night air of the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding his natural bias, his severe schooling, and his\\r\\nhonestly cynical and cynically limited view of this portion of his\\r\\nlittle world, he was ashamed of what he had just seen and heard and\\r\\ndone, and he was disgusted.  He walked down the avenue in the\\r\\ndeepened shadows, for the first time in a long while more than half\\r\\ninclined to ask himself whether what he was to get was worth the\\r\\nprice that he had already begun to pay for it; and for the first\\r\\ntime, by way of answer, frankly facing the fact that the position of\\r\\na corrupt magistrate was not much worse than that of a corrupt\\r\\nlawyer, and that neither position was much worse, and both certainly\\r\\nbetter paid, than the position in which his task had been to render\\r\\nanonymous assistance to the no less dubious course of more esteemed\\r\\ncorporation attorneys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was too occupied with these reflections, disquieting and\\r\\nconsolatory, to observe well the persons that passed him.  He\\r\\ncontinued his way along the curb rather because he had started upon\\r\\nit than because he at all cared about whither it led him, much as he\\r\\nwas continuing his progress in the political maze in which his lot\\r\\nwas cast.  He kept his head bent, and so he did not see a pale-faced,\\r\\nlarge-eyed woman that, turning a hasty corner, almost collided with\\r\\nhim and then suddenly drew back and crossed the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were changes in the woman\\'s face, which might have precluded\\r\\nrecognition.  He had last seen her on the eve of a surgical operation\\r\\nand she had looked ill, but now, the cumulative effect of that and\\r\\nmany other crises sat upon her, and it was only in her habitual gait,\\r\\nthe swaying languid pace of an unstudied young animal, that he might\\r\\nhave found enough to recall her to his memory.  But Dyker\\'s eyes were\\r\\ndirected inward and so, when she turned aside to avoid the man that\\r\\nshe fancied she had wronged, he did not realize that he had almost\\r\\ntouched elbows with the woman he had once rescued, fresh from her\\r\\ndismissal from the sacred precincts of Mrs. Ferdinand Chamberlin\\'s\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had started away from Washington Square in the same dull pain in\\r\\nwhich she had previously left the Ninth Street boarding-house\\r\\npresided over by the stony-breasted Mrs. Alberta Turner; she had been\\r\\nonly a wounded dog, whose sole desire was to find a dark corner in\\r\\nwhich she could suffer unobserved; but slowly there reasserted itself\\r\\nin her torpid brain that new impulse toward a questioning of life\\r\\nwhich had so appalled Philip Beekman.  The whole she could not see;\\r\\nher own case bulked so far in the foreground that little else of the\\r\\npicture was visible to her.  But she knew that an ill-constructed\\r\\nworld was against her; she concluded that all legitimate doors were\\r\\nclosed upon her, and she felt gradually kindling a wrath that would\\r\\nend in general reprisal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow she chanced into Rivington Street she did not know.  She had no\\r\\nclear idea as to where she was to go, except that she must not return\\r\\nto burden Katie Flanagan.  Yet, almost before she was clearly\\r\\nconscious of her whereabouts, she found herself accosted by a voice\\r\\nthat proved to come from the lips of Marian Lennox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary Morton!  How do you do?  Where are you going?  Where on earth\\r\\nhave you been?  Come in here; I\\'m just getting back from a walk.  I\\r\\nam so anxious to hear how you are getting on, and I have been so\\r\\ndisappointed because you never let me hear from you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rivulet of cheerful words poured from the calm-faced woman with\\r\\nunheeding force.  Each one of them fell upon her auditor with an\\r\\nunintended shock.  Mary, who had almost forgotten the pseudonym under\\r\\nwhich she had been presented at the Settlement, could say nothing.\\r\\nShe was carried up the steps and into the house, up the stairs and\\r\\ninto the deserted sitting-room on the second floor; and there she\\r\\nsank limply into a wicker chair beside a magazine-littered table,\\r\\ntête-à-tête with her former benefactress.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian, all good intentions, rested her delicate chin upon her white\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" she said, \"I am anxious to hear all about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, with a perplexed frown, looked hard at the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, there isn\\'t much to tell, Miss Lennox,\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense.  Of course there is, my dear.  You must understand that I\\r\\nam interested in everything about you--in everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s eyes sought, for a moment, the pure, cameo-like face.  They\\r\\ncould see no evil there, and they could see much kindliness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" she hesitated, \"I don\\'t know exactly where to begin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the beginning, of course.  How do you like your place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which place, Miss Lennox?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The place we sent you to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not there no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not there?\"  Marian raised her perfectly arched brows.  \"But, my\\r\\ndear Mary, why not?  Didn\\'t you like it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you have found a better place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Mary studied her questioner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Lennox,\" she said, \"I guess you people here have all sorts of\\r\\ngirls comin\\' around, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a surprise in this departure, and Marian\\'s deep eyes\\r\\nmirrored it.  The questioner had become the questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many kinds,\" she replied.  \"Why do you ask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Girls that work at all sorts of things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you want to help \\'em?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We try to help them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I thought so.  Can you help \\'em all, Miss Lennox?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they let us, I think we can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what do you do about them that hasn\\'t been straight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian softly caught her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" she said; \"I----\"  She had learned, since their last meeting, a\\r\\nlittle about the girls concerning whom Mary was inquiring, and she\\r\\nhad learned much regarding the Settlement\\'s attitude toward them; but\\r\\nshe had learned, also, that the work of the place most lay with the\\r\\nflowers that bloomed among the weeds, and so, \"Well, you see,\" she\\r\\nlamely continued, \"Well, we do the best we can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that, please, Miss Lennox?  I\\'ve got a particular reason for\\r\\nwanting to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian understood.  She spoke softly, and softly laced and interlaced\\r\\nher long white fingers, resting in her lap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We do the best we can, Mary,\" she repeated, more confidently.  \"When\\r\\nwe have investigated the case and are sure such a girl is sorry, or\\r\\nwasn\\'t entirely to blame, and that she means to do what is right in\\r\\nthe future, we make her our personal friend.  We encourage her to\\r\\ncome here and talk to us and get all the help possible.  We have her\\r\\naround to all the entertainments----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can she learn?\" asked Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Learn?\"  Marian\\'s voice was puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can she go to the clubs and the classes they talked about when I was\\r\\nhere first?\" explained Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian shook a doubtful head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see that wouldn\\'t do, right away, Mary,\" she said.  \"We have to\\r\\nthink of the other girls, and we have to protect the girls that _are_\\r\\nstraight as well as help those that haven\\'t been.  These are their\\r\\nclubs, after all, and they wouldn\\'t like it, if they knew.  It\\r\\nwouldn\\'t be just for us to deceive them, and they have the first\\r\\nclaim on our protection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the hardest question that Marian Lennox had ever had put to\\r\\nher.  She tried to form an answer, but though she could think of many\\r\\nthat seemed to her logical, she could think of none that seemed kind.\\r\\nSympathy sprang to her eyes.  She put out her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary!\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary had received her reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It don\\'t matter, Miss Lennox,\" she said, and she said it so calmly\\r\\nand so coldly that Marian involuntarily drew back in her chair.  \"I\\r\\njust wondered, that was all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped an instant.  Her hostess tried to speak and could not,\\r\\nbut presently the girl pursued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wasn\\'t square with you, that night you gave me the recommedation\\r\\nto Mrs. Turner, Miss Lennox.  I suppose I ought to\\'ve told you all\\r\\nabout myself, but I had to get work, an\\' I knew if I told you I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t get no job.  I\\'d been--I\\'d been in a house.  I wanted to get\\r\\naway, an\\' a man had just got me out a little more\\'n a month or so\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not exactly honest of you,\" said Marian.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was sorry as soon as she had spoken, but Mary, showing no sign of\\r\\nhurt or resentment, was continuing before reparation or explanation\\r\\ncould be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery simply she told the hard outward facts of her story.  She did\\r\\nnot give the history of her capture, because her experience with Mrs.\\r\\nTurner, with the homely little woman that had called at the\\r\\nemployment-agency, and with Philip Beekman had shown her that this\\r\\ncould not lessen the extent of her contamination.  Honestly rejecting\\r\\nher deception of Marian, goaded by that glimpse of Wesley Dyker into\\r\\nan impulse to make, at any cost to herself, the amend of truth for\\r\\nwhat fault she had committed, she was still more powerfully moved by\\r\\na determination to accept without reservation the part that the world\\r\\nhad now assigned her, and to fight under no colors save her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian, her fine face drawn with pain, heard the narrative in a\\r\\nsilence broken only when Mary had concluded with her departure from\\r\\nthe hospital.  The girl had mentioned no names.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And even this one man,\" murmured Marian at last, \"even this man who\\r\\nhad the courage to rescue you--even he was a visitor at such a place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, of course,\" said Mary, as yet unused to the idea of any blame\\r\\nattaching to the mere male patronage of slavery.  \"How else could I\\r\\nhave got him for help?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you said he was in love with that woman who conducted\\r\\nthe--house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With Miss Rose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you call her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Rose Légère she called herself, but I guess that wasn\\'t her\\r\\nname.  Yes, he was kind of in love with her.  He was one of her\\r\\nfavorites anyhow, but that was just because he had a pull with the\\r\\npoliticians, you see.  She let him love her so\\'s she could work him,\\r\\nan\\' when I put him wise to that, he was glad to help me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian clinched her fist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The abominable cur!\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!  Not that,\" protested Mary.  She had failed this man by\\r\\nretracting her affidavit, but she meant to be loyal to him\\r\\nwheresoever she could.  His name slipped from her with no thought of\\r\\nconsequences.  \"It took a lot of nerve an\\' goodness to do for me what\\r\\nMr. Dyker done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian\\'s gaze became fixed.  She was a woman whose whole training had\\r\\nshaped her against sudden betrayal of emotion, but she needed every\\r\\nprecept of that training now.  She did not start, she did not flush,\\r\\nbut her hands moved to the arms of her chair and gripped them hard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you say Mr. Wesley Dyker?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice did not betray her to the woman opposite, but Mary feared\\r\\nlest her own desire to defend her deliverer had betrayed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s who it was, Miss Lennox,\" she admitted, adding anxiously:\\r\\n\"But I didn\\'t go to mention it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You won\\'t tell it to no one that could use it against him, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\"  Marian laughed a short, hard laugh and rose to hide\\r\\nwhatever might be seen of her confusion.  \"Oh, no,\" she said; \"I\\r\\nshan\\'t speak of this to any enemy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer movement had seemed to Mary as a sign that the interview was\\r\\nending, but the laughter chilled her.  She also rose, and stood\\r\\nbefore her hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know him?\" she tremulously inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Marian, \"that I used to know somebody by some such\\r\\nname, but I do not know him now.  He need not disturb himself, and\\r\\nwhen you see him you need not disturb him by saying that you spoke of\\r\\nthis to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I won\\'t see him,\" Mary assured her.  \"It ain\\'t likely I\\'ll ever\\r\\nsee see him again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian\\'s eyes searched her, but they detected nothing disingenuous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have quarreled?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, only he wanted me to testify against Miss Rose, an\\' I was too\\r\\nscared.  I just hid myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a simple appeal in the bare words that brought their hearer\\r\\nto her better self.  Within her there burned a new and mounting fire,\\r\\nbut her face was cool and her actions were reasoned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary,\" she said, determined to sink herself and to be true to her\\r\\ncode, \"I am very sorry to have heard all this.  I am sorry that I\\r\\nseemed harsh when I said you had not been quite honest with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hadn\\'t been, Miss Lennox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not altogether your fault if you weren\\'t, Mary.  I begin to\\r\\nsee that it must be rather hard, sometimes, to be quite honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is, sometimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you have been honest now with me, and I want to help you.  I\\r\\nwant you to come around here in the way I described.  I want you to\\r\\ncome often.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and then, as Mary did not respond, she added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s eyes were on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think you can get me a job?\" she asked.  \"Do you think anyone\\r\\ncan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian had thought nothing about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, really, I don\\'t know, Mary.  But I suppose so.  Anyhow, I\\'ll\\r\\nsee what I can do--though of course I shouldn\\'t feel justified in\\r\\nprocuring you a position under false pretenses.  You understand that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mary, \"I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, at any rate, you will come around to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Mary did not look up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will come?\" repeated Marian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Lennox,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, then: to-morrow afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in the girl\\'s attitude made Marian uneasy.  She insisted on\\r\\nher point, but again Mary was slow to answer, and again Marian asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Lennox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At five o\\'clock, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll try, Miss Lennox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary stepped to the door.  She looked up and put out her hand, but,\\r\\nalthough Marian saw this, and started to respond, the\\r\\nsettlement-worker\\'s hand fell back to her side.  Mary seemed first to\\r\\nobserve and then not at all to have observed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I promise,\" she said quietly, and left the room and the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside, Marian was looking at her hand as if, because it had refused\\r\\nto seek that of the woman who, she concluded, had shared Rose\\r\\nLégère\\'s intimacy with Dyker, it had been scorched by the new passion\\r\\naflame in her own heart.  Outside, Mary, tramping the evening street,\\r\\nsaw, in her memory of that hand withheld, a hand pointing her\\r\\ndefinitely away from the keeping of her promise, pointing her onward\\r\\ndown the street as the place where, for the future, she must live and\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nKATIE\\'S DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nThe election came, and went in just the way that everybody expected\\r\\nit to go.  Wesley Dyker\\'s political craft, along with many others,\\r\\nwas carried on the inrushing waves of his party\\'s success to the\\r\\nhaven where he had desired it to rest, and the prosperity that had\\r\\nraised the price of votes to five dollars apiece immediately resumed\\r\\nits unostentatious levy upon the voters against the next election.\\r\\nThe defeated candidates forgot their so recent denunciations and\\r\\ncongratulated their victorious opponents; the victorious opponents\\r\\nforgot their tinsel pledges and resumed the safe and sure business of\\r\\ngovernment for revenue only, and the population of New York, like the\\r\\npopulation of most cities, forgot all the good things that had been\\r\\npledged it, and turned its energies to the everyday task of taking\\r\\nwhat it could get.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Carrie Berkowicz, homely and hopeless, pursued, with a\\r\\ndogged earnestness, the path that conditions had hewn for her, and\\r\\nalways she pursued it not alone.  As the waiting beast prowls behind\\r\\nthe slowly weakening traveler lost in a jungle, as the bird of prey\\r\\ncircles calmly above the wounded man in the forest, as both beast and\\r\\nbird stand by until there comes the moment when strength can no\\r\\nlonger oppose them, so, day after day, rarely speaking, but always\\r\\nwatching, there followed in this girl\\'s footsteps the dark young man\\r\\nwith curling hair and shining teeth, who had accosted her on Waverley\\r\\nPlace.  He seemed to watch for her morning entrance upon the street,\\r\\nand to be the last to see her when she dragged her wasting body into\\r\\nthe tenement at night.  Much of the time he dogged her like a foul\\r\\nshadow.  She would pass him in a doorway, she would see him lounging\\r\\nat a corner, she would catch glimpses of him across a crowded street.\\r\\nThere were times when she feared to look up lest she should have to\\r\\nanswer that prosperous leer and ornate bow; there were others, at\\r\\nlast, when, as his well-fed body brushed by her, she almost plucked\\r\\nat his sleeve with her hungry hands.  He never stopped, but sometime,\\r\\nshe knew, he would stop; he never said more than \"Good-morning\" or\\r\\n\"Good-evening,\", but sometime, sometime soon, he would, she knew, say\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd meanwhile, too, the politically unaffected routine of the Lennox\\r\\ndepartment-store began gradually to provide for one of its victims at\\r\\nleast the sense of approaching variety: Katie Flanagan realized that\\r\\nthe end of her usefulness--as that phrase is termed by employers,\\r\\nboarding-school principals, and others in authority--was rapidly\\r\\nnearing.  She managed to avoid the immaculate Mr. Porter for one\\r\\nweek, and, but for her worry over the condition of the wounded\\r\\nHermann, would have had moments when the sport was amusing.  As the\\r\\ntaskmaster paused at her counter one time during the second week, she\\r\\nachieved a sick aunt, who sufficed to account for her occupied\\r\\nevenings.  But when the days and the nights dragged by with no change\\r\\nfor either the better or the worse in the condition of this\\r\\nbed-ridden relative, and when the girl\\'s invention began to flag, and\\r\\nher spirit to tire, Mr. Porter\\'s glance grew more and more searching,\\r\\nhis manner less and less warm, and Katie knew that she must soon\\r\\nretreat or surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not seen much of you lately, Miss Flanagan,\" remarked Mr.\\r\\nPorter as, late one afternoon, he came mincing to the counter where\\r\\nshe stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been here pretty regular, Mr. Porter,\" answered Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter caressed a gray side-whisker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Um,\" said he.  \"I presume, then, that your grandmother is no worse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s me aunt, sir,\" rejoined Katie, with the mental addition: \"You\\r\\ndidn\\'t catch me that time, you ould tom-cat.\"  And she added: \"The\\r\\ngood woman\\'s some better, thanks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see,\" said Mr. Porter, and, indeed, his cold gaze seemed to see a\\r\\ngreat deal more than he was inclined to mention.  \"At this rate of\\r\\nimprovement, I hope you will soon find time to consider the matter we\\r\\ndiscussed that day in my office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope that, Mr. Porter,\" smiled Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" concluded Mr. Porter, turning from her--he always turned away\\r\\nwhen he was most significant.  \"I hope so, too, for I can\\'t well keep\\r\\nyour case under advisement much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the salesgirls nearby laughed openly, and Katie, when he\\r\\nwas out of sight, looked at them with a grimace half sad, half\\r\\nmocking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she was transferred to a bargain-counter for the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the outcome might have been there is no imagining.  What it was\\r\\ndepended, at any rate in part, upon the fact that, on what proved to\\r\\nbe her last day at the shop, she had come to work with a tired body\\r\\nand an aching head.  She had sat up half the night in a long endeavor\\r\\nto persuade Carrie to leave the futile battle of the strikers and\\r\\nturn to other employment; and, when Carrie had rejected all proposals\\r\\non the ground that, though the fight was lost, she knew no other sort\\r\\nof work, Katie had spent about all the remainder of the dark hours in\\r\\nan attempt to convince her roommate that the Irish girl\\'s wages were\\r\\nenough to support both of them for some time to come.  The result, so\\r\\nfar as went her conduct at the store, was a temper ready to explode\\r\\nwith the first spark, and that spark came when, in midafternoon, a\\r\\nnervous woman, who persisted in examining everything and buying\\r\\nnothing, interpreted Katie\\'s lassitude as indifference and so\\r\\nreported it to the floor-walker.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie was sent for to come to Mr. Porter\\'s office.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter looked up from the light at his desk, and then down again.\\r\\nHe stroked a whisker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit down, Miss Flanagan,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" replied Katie, \"I can take it just as well standin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take what?\" asked Mr. Porter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anythin\\' at all you have to say,\" said Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter continued to look at his desk and, by the name of \"Miss\\r\\nFlanagan,\" addressed it severely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Flanagan,\" he said, \"you have again been reported to me for\\r\\ndiscourtesy to a customer.  The other case had not yet been adjusted.\\r\\nIt might have been adjusted had not your cousin----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me aunt,\" prompted Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your aunt,\" frowned Mr. Porter to his desk, \"had not your aunt been\\r\\nso disinclined to recover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was gettin\\' absent treatment from a bad doctor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing of that----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think meself it was Malicious Animal Magnetism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please do not interrupt,\" said Mr. Porter, shaking his whiskers at\\r\\nthe desk.  \"I say that the previous case was not adjusted, though it\\r\\nmight have been, if your mother had not remained so ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me aunt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your aunt, if you prefer it.  Now comes this second case, and\\r\\nreally, I am curious to know whether you can suggest anything that\\r\\nwill make me regard it with the smallest degree of lenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked again at the desk, as if the desk were the case he had\\r\\nreferred to, but neither the desk nor Katie answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you cannot,\" he at last concluded, \"I see no course but one for\\r\\nme to pursue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie folded her arms across her breast and tossed her black head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s only one thing I can think of,\" said she, and waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter breathed hard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what,\" he inquired, still without looking at her, \"is that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie took a soft step forward.  She rested her hands upon the arm of\\r\\nhis desk and leaned her face toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\" she asked in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter shot, from the corner of his eyes, one of his crooked\\r\\nglances at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not quite sure,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" replied Katie, \"I\\'ll tell you.  The only one thing I can\\r\\nthink of that\\'d get you to let me off is the only one you can think\\r\\nof yourself--_an\\' that\\'s the one I won\\'t do!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice, which had begun so softly, ended in a loud note.  Her\\r\\nhands, which had been open, clinched.  Her body, which had been\\r\\nrelaxed, stiffened.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Porter sprang back from her, looked at her with hot fright in his\\r\\nusually cool eyes, and then shrank as far away as his desk-armchair\\r\\nwould permit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Flanagan,\" he spluttered, \"not so loud, please!  You will alarm\\r\\nthe store.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could alarm it!\" said Katie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what--what--I don\\'t understand----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, you do understand, all right, all right, Mr. Porter.  I know\\r\\nwhat you want; I\\'ve known it all along, an\\' if I hadn\\'t liked to make\\r\\na fool of you, I\\'d have told you long since what I tell you now: _You\\r\\nwon\\'t get it!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it were possible for Mr. Porter to grow whiter than his habit, he\\r\\ngrew whiter then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall--I shall ring for assistance!\" he protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No you won\\'t; you won\\'t dare; you\\'ll sit there, an\\' write me out a\\r\\nrecommendation an\\' an order for me pay--if your hand ain\\'t shakin\\'\\r\\ntoo much, an\\' if it is, I\\'ll write it for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he did write it.  After one look at her, he wrote it without a\\r\\nword, and \"without,\" as Katie carefully stipulated, \"any dockin\\' for\\r\\nthe last offense,\" and as she left him she delivered one Parthian\\r\\nbolt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember me to the girl you start after in the mornin\\',\" she said;\\r\\n\"an\\' when you go home to-night, just give me\\r\\ngrandmother-mother-aunt-cousin\\'s best regards to your grown-up\\r\\ngreat-grandchildren.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taste in which her revolution expressed itself may have been as\\r\\ndoubtful as the courage that inspired it was certain; but, had Mr.\\r\\nPorter been able to see into her mind as she hurried homeward, he\\r\\nwould have been gratified at what he found there.  The excitement had\\r\\ngone, and with it the bravery.  She had preserved her individual\\r\\nideals, but she now realized at what a cost she had preserved them.\\r\\nAgainst masculine attack it was sometimes inspiriting to defend\\r\\nherself, but to the slow and continuous advance of penury she well\\r\\nknew that, at last, she must succumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe passed her ugly little parish-church, and, remembering that she\\r\\nhad missed her last confession, entered its forbidding doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swinging portal closed softly behind her.  It shut out the glare\\r\\nof the day, it shut out the noises of the street, and it seemed to\\r\\nshut out the entire malicious power of the world.  Inside the cruel\\r\\nsunshine became kindly shade and comforting candle-light; the only\\r\\nsound was the occasional footfall of an unseen suppliant, and on the\\r\\ndistant high altar, shimmering and white at the end of the long\\r\\nperspective of the empty aisle, there rested the power she believed\\r\\nmore powerful than all on earth beside.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made her confession--not the easy and formal confession of the\\r\\nstrong, who need it most, but the frank probing question and full\\r\\nreply of the weak, who can profit by it least--and at its end she\\r\\nreceived not only the benediction that she traced to Heaven, but the\\r\\nshrewd advice that came direct from the big heart of a worldly-wise\\r\\nand beneficent man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, father,\" she added to the words of the ritual, as she\\r\\nrose to go, \"I\\'ll do me best to stick it out, but times be when it\\'s\\r\\npowerful hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experience had encouraged her, but, when she came at last into\\r\\nher barren home, there fell a blow that shook to its foundations the\\r\\nstructure of hope which she had so briefly reared.  On the bare table\\r\\nwas a single sheet of paper, and on the paper was written:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Katie:--I have gone away.  There was no use in saying good-by,\\r\\nfor that would only have hurt both of us, and I could not have made\\r\\nyou see that I was right not to board here any longer at your\\r\\nexpense, any more than you could make me see last night that you were\\r\\nright on your side.  Pretty soon I\\'ll come to see you and bring the\\r\\nmoney I owe you, but I can\\'t ever pay you back all your other\\r\\ngoodness, although I would give my right arm to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another thing.  By the time you get this letter Hermann will be to\\r\\nsee you at the store.  I was around to Bellevue yesterday, and we\\r\\nkept it as a surprise for you that he was coming out to-day.  I hope\\r\\nby this time you two will have fixed it all up; but if you haven\\'t,\\r\\nwell, I never talked to you about it much before, but I feel I must\\r\\nsay something now, because I seem to know more about life than I used\\r\\nto: take him, Katie dear, for there are only horrors ahead for any\\r\\ngirls like you and me if we don\\'t marry.  He\\'s a fine man and you\\r\\nlove him, and the two of you will do better together than you can do\\r\\napart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, good-by.  Don\\'t please bother to hunt for me--I won\\'t be on\\r\\npicket-duty any more, but _I am all right_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Lovingly,\\r\\n      \"CARRIE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie Flanagan put down the note.  She went to the narrow window and\\r\\ngazed blindly at the unsightly wing of the tenement across the narrow\\r\\ncourt outside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right?\" she said, the paper crumpling in her tightened hand.\\r\\n\"All right?  The poor girl\\'s got no money an\\' no job.  I know what\\r\\nshe\\'s thinking an\\' there\\'s no good followin\\'.  \\'All right,\\' she says!\\r\\nDear God, pity her: she means, \\'all wrong\\'!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie felt too deeply for her lost comrade to think much, if at all,\\r\\nof that portion of the note which touched her own interest.  Her eyes\\r\\nclouded; her shoulders shook; she fell upon her knees before the\\r\\nwindow-sill, and it was there that Hermann\\'s strong arms went about\\r\\nher neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven then, glad as she was to have him back again, she could do\\r\\nlittle but sob brokenly with her cheek against his breast, while he\\r\\ntold her how he had gone to the store, learned of her dismissal, and\\r\\ncome at once to the tenement, not pausing to knock when he heard her\\r\\nsobs.  He comforted her as best he could, but it was some time before\\r\\nany comfort availed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll had ended well for Hermann, but all had not easily so ended.  His\\r\\nwound had proved relatively slight, and he was sound and whole again:\\r\\nbut, the day before his dismissal from the hospital, Schleger had\\r\\nwaited upon him shamefacedly to confess that the rulers of the ward,\\r\\ndissatisfied with the bar-keeper\\'s Laodicean attitude toward their\\r\\npolitical labors, and urged by Mirka\\'s friends, had forbidden his\\r\\nre-engagement in the saloon.  Ludwig had been sorry, but helpless,\\r\\nand then, after exacting a score of promises, had disclosed his plan\\r\\nto open incognito a grocery-store on the West Side, himself remaining\\r\\nin charge of the saloon and Hoffmann appearing, on a good salary, as\\r\\nthe owner of the new venture.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie looked up at him with eyes shining blue through a dispersing\\r\\nmist of tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' what about the dirty Dago that shot you?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann smiled broadly.  His face was thinner and not so ruddy as\\r\\nonce, but it was cheerful still and more determined than of old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Austrian?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis the same thing,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach, vell, I guess ve von\\'t do nussing about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You won\\'t be lettin\\' him go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhy not?  Dere\\'s none to swear fur me and a hun\\'red to swear fur\\r\\nhim.  I kind of belief Schleger gif me de new blace as brice fur\\r\\nkeepin\\' quiet, so dere\\'s nussing to gain und efferysing to lose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first she would not hear of it, and she used her opposition to\\r\\nthis dropping of the charge against Mirka as if it were an argument\\r\\nproperly formed to oppose the next scheme that he proposed to her.\\r\\nBut he had found her in her moment of weakness when he had come to\\r\\nher in his hour of strength renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said firmly, \"und dis evenin\\' ve\\'ll be married.  I got der\\r\\nlicense; I stopped at der church; Father Kelly\\'s vatin\\'--dis evenin\\',\\r\\nKatie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world was slipping from beneath her feet.  She did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In two year\\',\" he went on, \"one part of dot store ve\\'ll own.  Katie,\\r\\nit\\'s our chance; und in de meanvhile, if der Herr Gott sends der\\r\\nbabies--und pray Gott he vill--dey von\\'t at least do no vorse as ve\\r\\nhof done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew her tighter, but she twisted in his arms and got free, so\\r\\nthat he held only one of her firm hands.  They stood there face to\\r\\nface, between them the unfathomable chasm of sex, their feet\\r\\ntrembling at its brink.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the areaway the straight shafts of the setting sun caught the\\r\\ndirty little window-panes of the nearby squalid rooms and turned them\\r\\nto a shining glory.  The rays were reflected into Katie\\'s own room;\\r\\nthey burnished the cheap paper into cloth of gold, they touched the\\r\\nfloor and gilded it, they made of the rickety table a thing of\\r\\nsplendor, and of the worn chairs fairy thrones.  Hermann\\'s blonde\\r\\nhead was crowned with a halo, and as he looked at the girl, against\\r\\nthe background of those yellow windows like a Madonna against the\\r\\nbackground that the Etruscan painters loved, he saw in her eyes what\\r\\nhe had never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the momentary struggle the coils of her black hair had loosened\\r\\nand fallen below her waist.  They framed a face no longer strong with\\r\\nrestraint, handsome from the flush of battle against the world, no\\r\\nlonger set and self-reliant, but a face through which shone the light\\r\\nof the life-force, the motive-power of the universe, a beautiful\\r\\nface, white, frightened, wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can--can you really love me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe scarcely said the words.  Rather her lips formed them with no\\r\\nvoice behind.  But he had heard her before her lips so much as moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach,\" he cried, \"I hof alvays lofed you, Katie, but now it is\\r\\nsomesing new und more.  Katie, I sink--I belief sings I neffer belief\\r\\nbefore, und I sink it must be der blessing of Gott dot I can _see_ in\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' there won\\'t be anny other woman?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are _all_ vomen, Katie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Hermann,\" she said, \"I think I will be all women for you.  I\\r\\nwill be all you want.  I will work an\\' share, good luck an\\' bad.  I\\r\\nnever before was glad I knew how to work, but now I _will_ be all you\\r\\nwant--all, _all_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put her hand to his lips, and held it there an instant: Fifth\\r\\nAvenue does these things, casually, no better than the Bowery, when\\r\\nthe Bowery has a mind for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Katie,\" he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took her hand away.  She tried to laugh a little, but the\\r\\nlaughter, clear and silvery, caught suddenly in her throat.  Her\\r\\nmouth twisted, and she raised the hand and put her lips where his had\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\\r\\nReeling with the tremor of that sight, his arms recaptured her, and\\r\\nthis time held her fast.  She swayed and yielded.  Her own arms\\r\\nanswered his, and his lips met, for the first time freely, the lips\\r\\nshe had so bravely kept for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case against Mirka was then and there dismissed, and the High\\r\\nCourt handed down a final decision _in re_ Hoffmann _vs._ Flanagan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nMARIAN\\'S WAY\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley Dyker looked with unaffected approval about the second-story\\r\\nfront room in Rivington Street.  He saw the calmly colored walls, the\\r\\nexcellent mats upon the floor, the ordered writing-desk and, near the\\r\\ncenter, the heavy library-table, covered with carefully piled\\r\\nmagazines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" he said, nodding easily to the woman that stood motionless\\r\\nbefore him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman\\'s answer was not ready, but Dyker, whose eyes were on\\r\\nsurroundings almost as animate, pursued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, you have it rather cozy here, considering the\\r\\nneighborhood.  I\\'m not half so well fixed myself.  I\\'m glad to see\\r\\nthat, Marian, and I\\'m more than glad to see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his heavy lids to look at her.  He had resolved when, a\\r\\nshort while before, she had sent for him, to make no mention of their\\r\\nlong separation.  He was sure that the sending meant he was to have a\\r\\nchance to recall to her the superior wisdom that had expressed itself\\r\\nin his advice against working among the poor; but of the time that\\r\\nhad elapsed since that advice was given he had meant to say nothing.\\r\\nAlways he had confidently expected this moment, and, now that it had\\r\\ncome, she must find him prepared.  He put out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Marian was thinking of how, in this same room, she had said\\r\\ngood-by to Mary.  She compressed her lips a moment before answering,\\r\\nand, when she did answer, it was only to say, quite calmly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to shake hands with you, Wesley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDay and night the words that Mary had so innocently dropped\\r\\nconcerning Dyker had stirred the fire in Marian\\'s breast.  Supposing\\r\\nthat her protégée had shared with Rose the easy caresses of Wesley,\\r\\neven at a time when Marian had been on the point of accepting them,\\r\\nthe failure of that protégée to return to the Settlement for aid or\\r\\nconsolation had made Marian the prey to a hundred contending\\r\\nemotions.  She was glad that Mary had not come back, because Mary\\r\\nadrift meant Mary suffering.  She was sorry that Mary had not come\\r\\nback, because she wanted to ask the girl so many things that she had\\r\\nat first neglected to ask.  She doubted Mary and was ashamed of her\\r\\ndoubts; she doubted Dyker and was still ashamed.  One thought tore at\\r\\nanother, and all tore at her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn entering the Settlement she had left Dyker in a proud anger that\\r\\nforbade her acting upon his offer to come to her whenever she should\\r\\nsend for him; on dismissing Mary she had so framed her promise of\\r\\nsecrecy that she might repeat to Wesley the unfortunate woman\\'s\\r\\nunconscious accusation; and on twisting and turning the reptilian\\r\\nthing over in her mind, she said in one breath that she could not\\r\\nsend for Dyker and could not be at peace unless she did send.  The\\r\\nfiercest passion that a conventional woman has is the passion for the\\r\\nknowledge that will most likely clinch her unhappiness.  Marian was\\r\\ncertain that she must know the truth, and she told herself that she\\r\\nwas certain of but one fact beside: that she did not love this man;\\r\\nthat she had never loved him--and, presumably because of that, she\\r\\nhad at last, on this day shortly after the election, incontinently\\r\\ntelephoned to him to come to Rivington Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had said to herself that it was unfair to condemn him unheard.\\r\\nShe had replied to herself that she did not care enough about him\\r\\neither to condemn or to acquit.  She had ended by the realization\\r\\nthat, deny it as she might, the fact of condemnation remained; and\\r\\nshe had inclined solely toward the attitude of impartial justice\\r\\nuntil, in the briefest possible time after receiving her message,\\r\\nDyker had entered this room.  Then, immediately, her mood had once\\r\\nmore changed, as it was to change so often during the ensuing\\r\\ninterview; she had left the bench and had become the prosecutor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Dyker\\'s appearance was in part to blame for this.  She had,\\r\\nof course, not seen him since that summer parting; it is seldom\\r\\npleasant for a woman to find that separation from her has left no\\r\\nscar upon an admirer, and it is always annoying to a\\r\\ndistrict-attorney to detect no consciousness of guilt in the\\r\\ncountenance of the accused; yet Dyker had come into her presence with\\r\\na buoyant step and a ready smile.  The pressure of campaigning had\\r\\nlessened, though it could not wholly check, the progress of his\\r\\ndissipations, and his face still flaunted the tokens of its former\\r\\nglory.  His eyes were not noticeably more timid than of old, and his\\r\\nmouth was, as of old, hidden.  Add to this the pleasure, still fresh,\\r\\nof his election, and the satisfaction of a man fancying himself just\\r\\nplaced in a position to say \"I told you so\" to the woman he loves,\\r\\nand it will be seen that Magistrate Dyker, if not at his best, had\\r\\nbeen at least in a moment of expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now she had said that she would not take his hand!  He could\\r\\nscarcely believe his ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t want--I am afraid I do not understand you, Marian,\" he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer great brown eyes looked steadily into his puzzled gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit down, please,\" she responded.\\r\\n\\r\\nMechanically, he drew a deep wicker chair to the window, and obeyed\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat opposite him and, for fully a minute, while with galloping\\r\\nbrain he watched her, she looked through the glass at crowded,\\r\\nshuffling Rivington Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is simple enough, Wesley,\" she at last resumed.  \"Before I can\\r\\nthink of renewing anything like my old friendly attitude toward\\r\\nyou----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your friendly attitude!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was scarcely more than that.  Before I can renew it, there is\\r\\nsomething that must be explained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker\\'s own attitude was still that of the average lover, and the\\r\\naverage lover cannot see beyond his own shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\"--he was momentarily relieved and prepared, in consequence, to\\r\\nshow a proper magnanimity--\"you needn\\'t explain, Marian!  I knew you\\r\\nwould find that I was right, and that this was no place for you.  I\\r\\nappreciate perfectly how you feel: you have been disappointed and\\r\\ndisillusioned, and it is like you handsomely to want to confess that\\r\\nyou were wrong.  But let\\'s merely consider that done, and say no more\\r\\nabout it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ended in a warmth of good feeling; but the did not seem inclined\\r\\nto accept this proffer, and, as he paused, he wondered what was in\\r\\nher gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she said, \"you are not quite correct in your surmise.  I have\\r\\nbeen disappointed and disillusioned.  I have been disappointed in one\\r\\nof the people among whom I have been working; but I have been\\r\\ndisillusioned in regard to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped.  He began to guess now what was back of those calm eyes\\r\\nof hers.  Disillusioned in regard to him?  At the first breath it\\r\\nseemed incredible, but at the next his mind filled with the ghosts of\\r\\nhis experience, the grim figures that compose the pageant of that\\r\\nreal life of a man, upon which he never raises the curtain for the\\r\\nfeminine eyes most dear to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In regard to me?\" he echoed.  He was wondering, in hidden panic,\\r\\nwhich especial image had been revealed to her, and he sought defense\\r\\nin general denial.  \"You have been listening to East Side\\r\\nneighborhood gossip, Marian, and I shouldn\\'t have believed it of you.\\r\\nYou have heard one of the hundreds of groundless ante-election libels\\r\\nthat are the common ammunition used against anyone in politics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer face, always fair, was gently tinted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I have heard,\" she replied, \"I heard from somebody that has\\r\\nnothing to do with politics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Down here,\" insisted Dyker, still seeking to dislodge the enemy and\\r\\nforce it into the open field of recognition, \"down here all the men\\r\\nhave something to do with politics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a woman, Wesley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had feared that.  He had feared it when she first spoke of coming\\r\\nto the Settlement.  But he wasted no time in such thought; he must,\\r\\nbefore he committed himself, discover which of several possible\\r\\nwomen, was concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" he laughed, \"the women are mixed up in political gossip, too;\\r\\nor, at any rate,\" he added, \"they are always glad to repeat what\\r\\ntheir menfolk don\\'t hesitate to tell them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The woman I refer to was a part of the thing she told.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian said it softly, but her white throat trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker looked at her swiftly, and as swiftly lowered his eyes.\\r\\nInstantly now he guessed what it was that she had heard; an instant\\r\\nmore and he thought the thing improbable.  Then, resolved at all\\r\\nevents not to approach self-betrayal by showing his intuition, he\\r\\nassumed the point of view of the lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marian,\" he said, pulling at his mustache that she might see--as she\\r\\ndid--that his hand was steady, \"is this fair?  Is it right to condemn\\r\\nme on a charge of which I know nothing and because of evidence of\\r\\nwhich I haven\\'t heard a syllable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she answered, \"it isn\\'t fair.  That is why I sent for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bit his lip, but faced her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSteadily she met his renewed gaze until his eyes failed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven then her own eyes, never wavering, could find in him not enough\\r\\nto determine her.  The desire to get at the truth, whatever the truth\\r\\nmight be, was plying its angry whip upon her shoulders.  When Mary\\r\\nhad spoken, Marian had received the intelligence as innocently\\r\\nimparted fact.  But now the man before her gave nothing that her\\r\\ninexperience could set down as a sign of what she considered a great\\r\\nsin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wesley,\" she began, leaning towards him, \"the girl that told me this\\r\\ntold it inadvertently.  More than that, she did not even know that I\\r\\nhad ever heard of you.  She did not want to hurt you: she was\\r\\ngrateful to you, because you had rescued her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis intuition, then, had not failed him: it was Violet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" he smiled, his heart heavy with the fear of losing Marian\\'s\\r\\nlove, his lips still sparring for a more open lead, \"I am afraid I\\'m\\r\\nno knight-errant, Marian, to go about rescuing damsels in distress.\"\\r\\nBut he did not like the sound of the phrase, and, seeing that she\\r\\nliked it no better, he explained: \"You surely remember how I feel\\r\\nabout these poor women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she said that your politics brought you into touch with the\\r\\nworst sort of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian paused there to give him another chance, but his only protest\\r\\nwas:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not my politics.  The duties of my profession, before I was elected\\r\\na magistrate, sometimes made it necessary to defend such women.  You\\r\\nmust have known that.  There was no dishonor there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my informant added,\" continued Marian, \"that you used your\\r\\npolitical influence to gain their friendship, perhaps even to protect\\r\\nthem, and\"--she felt the depths before her; her cheeks went hot; her\\r\\nbrown eyes filled--\"and certainly to--to----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt it and looked up with anger in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To what?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clasped her damp hands tight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To live with them,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he had expected the implication, he had hardly expected so\\r\\nclose an approach to the specific, and therefore the start to which\\r\\nit behooved him to give way was not altogether disingenuous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marian!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bent her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you believe that?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accusation uttered, sick uncertainty gripped and tossed her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know what to believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how can you think I would be capable of such things?  The girl\\r\\nlied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer judgment swayed dizzily.  Between word and word she was now for\\r\\nand now against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t think of any motive that this girl might have to lie,\" she\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know what motive she has?\" returned Dyker, realizing in\\r\\nwhat good stead his training as a pleader of bad cases might stand\\r\\nhim.  \"How do you know what political enemies of mine may have sent\\r\\nher to you?  You say that, on her own confession, she is a vile\\r\\nwoman----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not say that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said she charged herself with being part of this alleged\\r\\nbusiness.  You confessed that you were disappointed in her\\r\\npersonally.  What possible credit can be given to the story of a\\r\\nwoman that begins by admitting such abominations?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian tried to speak, but indecision choked her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you, you were tricked,\" he pursued, with a glib rapidity that\\r\\nshe did not know whether to attribute to innocence or guilt.  \"I may\\r\\nhave lost a case for some friend of this girl.  I may have won a suit\\r\\nagainst one of her hangers-on.  There are men in the lower sort of\\r\\npolitics, I\\'m ashamed to say, that don\\'t hesitate to use such tools,\\r\\nand I have offended a good many of them.  Before you considered this\\r\\nstory true, don\\'t you feel that you should have thought of one of\\r\\nthese explanations?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Marian faltered.  The relentless tide of her emotions\\r\\nnow set in again in his favor.  Mary had told her story so calmly,\\r\\nwith so little feeling concerning her own sufferings, that Marian\\r\\nkept wondering if it might not have been an invention.  She was sure\\r\\nthat, all along, somewhere in her heart, she had wanted to think the\\r\\nbest of him; wanted, despite her accusing jealousy, to acquit him.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she repeated despairingly; \"but\"--and the tide began\\r\\nto flow once more--\"unless I can be certain of her motive for lying\\r\\nto me, don\\'t you see, Wesley, don\\'t you see that I must have proof of\\r\\nyour innocence from you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him in wide appeal.  The undertow had caught her, and\\r\\nshe was crying for help from shore.  She knew now that she loved him,\\r\\nand she had learned the ultimate tragedy of love: that love and\\r\\nmistrust may be one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can I know anything?\" she went on.  \"How can I be sure of\\r\\nanything?  How can I understand such a world as this?  It seems as if\\r\\nall the earth was lying to me, and as if all the earth could lie and\\r\\nstill look honest.  I trusted the girl; I trusted you.  I beg of you\\r\\nto prove to me that I was right only when I trusted you.\\r\\nWesley,\"--she almost extended her arms to him--\"tell me that you\\r\\ndidn\\'t do it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker saw his advantage, but decided that the way to keep it was to\\r\\nbe firm.  He spoke quickly, yet coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was this woman?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think I ought to tell you?\" she pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ought to tell me?  Why, Marian, how else am I to prove what you ask\\r\\nme to prove?  If you are to be at all fair with me, how can you start\\r\\nby hiding the false witnesses against me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was right, she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever hear,\" she asked, \"of Mary Morton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nToo late to weigh his words he remembered the name that the girl whom\\r\\nhe had called Violet had signed to her affidavit.  Before that\\r\\nrecollection was clear to him, he made his reply in the deceit that\\r\\nis the refuge of all the confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are sure?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absolutely\";--he had to keep it up now--\"although, if she is the\\r\\nsort of woman she says she is, she probably has as many aliases as a\\r\\nsafe-cracker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this girl--I should think you would not forget her if you had\\r\\never known her: she must have been good-looking once.  She has blue\\r\\neyes and brown hair.  You could see from her face that she has\\r\\nsuffered, but you could see that she used to be almost beautiful.\\r\\nShe has the walk of a queen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think.\"--Marian was still intent upon certainty.--\"When I saw her\\r\\nshe was both times dressed alike, though on her second visit her\\r\\nclothes, first new, had grown a little shabby.  She wore a cloak--I\\r\\nforget its color, but it was dark--and a beaver hat.  She----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew those clothes; he had reason to; but his interruption was in\\r\\nstrict accord with his previous denial:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are thousands of women answering that vague description.  I am\\r\\nsure, however, that I don\\'t know this one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarian did not observe that, on his own showing, his assurance was\\r\\nwithout foundation.  Her words had brought Mary vividly before her\\r\\nand, for a minute, she well-nigh forgot her own distress in the\\r\\nmisery of that figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has had a great deal of trouble,\" said Marian.  \"Why, from what\\r\\nshe told me, these girls must be worse treated than the blacks in the\\r\\nCongo; they must be far worse off than our own American negro slaves\\r\\nused to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt--if what she said was true.  But I know it was not true.\\r\\nMy profession has made me see a great deal of these poor women, and I\\r\\nknow that if they are slaves it is because they want to be.\"  He\\r\\nwaved away the whole matter with a toss of his hand.  He wanted some\\r\\ninformation, and he did not want to show why he wanted it.  \"That all\\r\\ngoes to prove that if it was she who told you this foul story about\\r\\nme, then the story was that of a born liar,\" he declared.  \"You say\\r\\nshe was here twice.  What were the circumstances?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe breathed more freely.  He had only to convince Marian and get her\\r\\nto quit her work in disgust before further gossip should reach her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so you don\\'t know her?\" she concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor Mrs. Rose Légère?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly know of that person,\" he said--it was the part of wisdom\\r\\nto admit some knowledge.  \"Nobody that knows anything about our\\r\\npolice-courts, as I have had to know, can be entirely ignorant of\\r\\nher.  She is one of the most notorious women in New York.  I know a\\r\\ngreat deal about her, but, except for one occasion, when I saw her in\\r\\na station-house, I have never set eyes on her in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke with such precision that Marian caught a gratified breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is she another Settlement visitor?\" inquired Wesley, devoutly hoping\\r\\nthat no miracle of reformation had, since their last meeting, been\\r\\nwrought upon Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she is not.  It was she that was said to have been one of\\r\\nyour--your friends, until she made friends with your political\\r\\nenemies.  The girl that told me was, of course, the Mary Morton I\\r\\nhave mentioned.  She said that you were intimate with this Mrs.\\r\\nLégère, and I understood that even Mary----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker was genuinely glad to find some accusation that he could deny\\r\\nwith truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in that word and his utterance of it made her look at him\\r\\nhard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She didn\\'t want to tell the story,\" Marian insisted.  \"I got it from\\r\\nher.  How could it have been the result of malice or a plot?  Didn\\'t\\r\\nI tell you that she said you had rescued her from the Légère woman\\'s\\r\\nhouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDyker reflected.  He wished that he had been as sweeping in his\\r\\ndiscrediting of Violet, under the pseudonym of Mary Morton, as he had\\r\\nbeen in his discrediting of Rose.  Failing that, he might even have\\r\\nexplained this rescue and have become something of a hero.  Both\\r\\nopportunities were, however, gone.  He must make the best of what\\r\\nremained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marian,\" he said, speaking slowly, quite calmly, and with no small\\r\\nappearance of sincerity of purpose, \"I needn\\'t bring you any proof of\\r\\nthis Légère woman\\'s bad character--the qualities of that character\\r\\nyou yourself know--and as for this Morton girl, I can only fall back\\r\\non what I have already pointed out to you.  You say she confesses her\\r\\nevil life: how can you, then, credit anything an admittedly abandoned\\r\\ncreature may have told you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t the worst of women tell the truth sometimes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Practically never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\"--Marian passed a weary hand across her forehead--\"how could\\r\\nthis girl be in a position to know what she says she knows, if she\\r\\nhadn\\'t led just the kind of life that you say makes her an inevitable\\r\\nliar?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an excellent sort of answer.  Dyker tossed his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am hurt, Marian,\" he said.  \"I thought you had some faith in me; I\\r\\nthought you knew me.  I don\\'t see how you can persist in this\\r\\nattitude--how you can say these things.  Why, I have been in your\\r\\nhouse: I have known you and your father; whereas these\\r\\npeople--Marian, I love you; why should I lie to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had been keeping her hand upon her forehead, but she lowered it\\r\\nnow to her eyes, where it was joined by its mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she moaned.  \"That\\'s just it: I don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what,\" he asked, \"can I do to convince you?  I won\\'t upbraid\\r\\nyou; I won\\'t be harsh.  My sane course would be to pay no attention\\r\\nto accusations from such a character as this Mary Morton, and your\\r\\nsane course would be to pay no attention to them.  But I know how\\r\\nthings are in this neighborhood; I know the bad atmosphere you have\\r\\nbeen breathing ever since you came down here.  Long ago I told you\\r\\nexactly what would happen; I foresaw it all.  I told you when you\\r\\ninsisted on going into this work that these women would poison your\\r\\nmind, distort your vision, make you doubt all that is best in life.\\r\\nApparently, they have succeeded; but I don\\'t speak of that.  Marian,\\r\\nunless it was in some police-court--perhaps at the time I saw Rose\\r\\nLégère--I never saw this girl in my life.  I don\\'t understand her\\r\\nenmity any better than you do.  It may spring from some imagined\\r\\nwrong to one of her friends, or it may be a political plot.  But,\\r\\nexcept as it affects your regard for me, I don\\'t care anything about\\r\\nit.  All that I do care about, all that I do want to accomplish is to\\r\\nrestore you to a normal view of things, get you out of these foul\\r\\nmental and material surroundings, and bring you back to your own\\r\\nproper world.  I want to do this and to make you know the truth\\r\\nconcerning myself.  Tell me what will bring this about, and I\\'ll do\\r\\nit without a moment\\'s loss of time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought that, in the nature of the case, there was nothing very\\r\\ndifficult or inconvenient that she could demand; but he had counted\\r\\ntoo much on the artificial and too little upon the natural and\\r\\nprimitive woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer face still hidden, she felt the full force of his appeal, but the\\r\\ntempest had its wild will of her.  She believed him guilty; she\\r\\nbelieved him innocent.  She believed that, if he were guilty,\\r\\ntemptation had come from the woman; she believed that, if he were\\r\\ninnocent, there was nevertheless something--she did not know\\r\\nwhat--that he was hiding from her.  Faith was ready to destroy much,\\r\\nbut would not jealousy destroy more?  Her jealousy had consumed\\r\\ndignity, it had ravaged custom, it was burning restraint.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s words had drawn in Marian\\'s mind a concrete picture, and the\\r\\ncontemplation of that picture had awakened an anger in which her\\r\\ngenuine love had for the first time genuinely expressed itself.\\r\\nBefore, she could have heard with light regret of Dyker\\'s engagement\\r\\nto marry another woman.  Before, she might herself have drifted with\\r\\nhim through a placid wooing into the port of marriage that, until\\r\\nthis revelation, she had in no wise understood.  But now she saw\\r\\nthings specifically, and in the element of the specific the quality\\r\\nthat she had known as \"womanliness\" was dissolved and the thing that\\r\\nshe at last knew to be Woman was evolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue, she was thus still determined, depended upon proof of\\r\\ninnocence.  He must be clean, and she must know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uncovered her fine face, strangely stronger for its grief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wesley,\" she said, \"I do remember all that you told me these women\\r\\nand this work would do to me.  If you prove to be wrong, I shall stay\\r\\non here, and, of course, never see you again; but if you prove to be\\r\\nright I shall give it up, and then, Wesley, I shall marry you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose with a glad cry; but she, rising also, waved him back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" she said.  \"Either find Mary Morton and the proofs that\\r\\nshe is dishonest--not only what I know she is, but dishonest in what\\r\\nshe would say and do--show me this, or else----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith straining resolution, he confronted her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or else?\" he prompted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or else bring her to me with her own denial and explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV\\r\\n\\r\\nDAUGHTERS OF ISHMAEL\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mary left Rivington Street she faced the inevitable.  She had\\r\\nseen the impossibility of domestic service; she knew nothing of any\\r\\nother trade; she could not endure the shame of an institution, and\\r\\nher fortune consisted of just fourteen dollars and fifty cents.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked, for a long time, aimlessly.  The night thickened and,\\r\\nblock by block, the streets flashed into electric illumination, each\\r\\nseparate flame glowing like a malevolent eye to show her misery.  Her\\r\\nstrength, never yet fully restored, failed her.  Her feet were tired,\\r\\nher knees bent irregularly, her head ached.  As at her first sight of\\r\\nit, the city, which she knew scarcely better than on that spring\\r\\nevening when she had been tossed into it, was a conscious prison\\r\\nimplacably shutting her in forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked westward, and then northward.  She dodged across Fifth\\r\\nAvenue among the automobiles of careless, comfortable people on their\\r\\nways to one place or another of swift enjoyment.  She passed a\\r\\nnotorious café at the warm windows of which she saw, seated at laden\\r\\ntables and opposite leering men, the painted faces of softly gowned\\r\\nwomen, the more successful examples of what she soon must be.  And\\r\\nshe came to hurrying Broadway through whose crowds she saw silently\\r\\nand cunningly darting, with smiling hate written on their tired,\\r\\nrouged lips, the girls whose dawn was the lighting of the\\r\\nstreet-lamps and from whom she wanted to ask for instruction in the\\r\\none means of livelihood that remained to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer soul was as weakened and vitiated as her body, and by much the\\r\\nsame forces.  Into her escape from Rose\\'s, into her work at Mrs.\\r\\nTurner\\'s, into her appeal to the employment-agency and her tasks at\\r\\nMrs. Chamberlin\\'s she had put every particle of strength that she\\r\\ncould harness, and the result had always been failure.  The social\\r\\nsystem was too mighty.  She could not prevail against it.  She must\\r\\ndo its bidding, and since it was so impractically constituted as to\\r\\nbid her prey upon it, her sole solace must be found in preying\\r\\nfiercely.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned into a cross-street, full of refulgent drinking-places\\r\\nthat beckoned by swinging doors, behind which were the voices of\\r\\nsingers and through which passed, in alone and out with shame-faced\\r\\nmen, unending streams of women with white faces and vermillion mouths\\r\\nand sadly encircled eyes.  But Mary pressed westward, though she did\\r\\nnot clearly know her intention until, having crossed two avenues, she\\r\\nfound that the cafés gave place to small shops, and that the shops\\r\\nwere giving place to tall, moldy buildings with long stairways before\\r\\nthem, houses that had once, plainly, made homes, but that were now,\\r\\nas plainly, barracks for lodgers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom one of these she saw come a slight girl under a huge hat heavy\\r\\nwith two great plumes.  Mary waited until this girl drew near, first\\r\\nhesitated when she observed that the girl was scarcely fifteen, then\\r\\nspoke when she noted the bedizened dress and the face of which the\\r\\nchildish beauty had been trained to maturity and hardness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you tell me if I can get a room around here?\" she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\'s knowing eyes studied her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" she said.  \"When did you hit the road?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-day.  I want to find a room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you can\\'t go wrong.  The house I live in is full-up; but you\\r\\ncan ring \\'most any bell along here and get what you want.  There\\r\\nain\\'t no choice.  One\\'s as bum as another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded saucily and went on her way, and Mary climbed the steps of\\r\\nthe first house she came to.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer ring was answered by a woman that appeared, as far as Mary could\\r\\nobserve in the faint light, to be about sixty years old.  Her hair\\r\\nwas gray and severely arranged; her dress was shabby, and she looked\\r\\nvery tired.  To Mary she did not seem to be at all the type that\\r\\nwould conduct the sort of place which the wanderer just then needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you rent me a room?\" she nevertheless inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With privileges?\" asked the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a phrase new to its hearer, but she understood that it\\r\\ndescribed the kind of room she wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she almost whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the woman did not lower her voice.  Her descent, as Mary\\r\\nafterwards learned, had been by slow stages, and her complaisance had\\r\\nbeen enforced through a history that began with the establishment of\\r\\na respectable boarding-house, when a reform-election had driven her\\r\\nhusband from the police-force, passed through a widowhood imposed\\r\\nupon by absconding lodgers and raised house-rents, and ended by the\\r\\nadmission of first one and then many patrons that were, though they\\r\\nwanted what she had not always cared to give, at least certain to pay\\r\\nwhat she had to turn over to the church-corporation that owned the\\r\\nproperty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got a nice second-floor front, just a step from the bath-room, at\\r\\neighteen dollars,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A month?\" inquired Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman regarded her as if she were somewhat of a curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not: eighteen a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I--I couldn\\'t afford that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a nice room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I guess it is, but----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might let it to you for fifteen, to start with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I couldn\\'t afford it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there\\'s the parlor.  It\\'s only twelve, an\\'ll be vacant\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to get a place for to-night.  Haven\\'t you\\r\\nanything cheaper?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t seem to know nothin\\' about prices, miss.\"  The landlady\\r\\nappeared to reflect.  \"But there\\'s the third-floor back hall-room,\"\\r\\nshe added; \"I can let you have it for seven, an\\' better than that you\\r\\ncan\\'t do anywheres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can easy make three times that much,\" the woman urged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you----\"  Mary wet her dry lips.  \"Do you think so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think so?  Why, the lady that had that room for a whole year till\\r\\nlast week made as high as twenty dollars a night.  She moved out o\\'\\r\\nhere to her own flat.  But then, she was good-looking, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had entertained some vague notion of a small gas-stove, and some\\r\\nsaving in the matter of meals; but this the landlady could in no wise\\r\\npermit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The insurance sharks won\\'t allow it,\" she said, and concluded in a\\r\\ntone that showed the later fact to be of more importance: \"Besides,\\r\\nit so runs up the gas-bills.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary said no more.  She paid for a week in advance, and was shown at\\r\\nonce to the cell she had leased so dearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a little, gaudily-papered room scarcely fifteen feet long and\\r\\nnot much more than two-thirds that in width.  A stationary washstand\\r\\nwas so placed that the door could not open freely.  At the single\\r\\nnarrow window stood an unsteady table of no apparent purpose, and\\r\\nalong the side a clothes-press and a narrow, pine bureau.  The bed,\\r\\nhowever, was the chief feature of furniture, and that was large and\\r\\ncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll give you clean sheets every Sunday morning regular,\" said the\\r\\nlandlady; \"but any changes you want between you\\'ll have to pay for\\r\\nthe washin\\' of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe demanded, and received, twenty-five cents for a latch-key, added\\r\\nthat she permitted no noise in the rooms, and departed, leaving Mary\\r\\nsitting on the edge of the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\'s experiences in the house of Rose Légère had prepared her\\r\\nbut imperfectly for this adventure.  It was a new business, and Mary\\r\\ndid not know how to embark upon it.  She was as lost as the\\r\\nchorus-girl, unused to the purchase of railway tickets and the\\r\\nengaging of \"hotel-accommodations,\" who finds herself stranded in a\\r\\nsmall town.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to the bureau and looked at herself in its distorting\\r\\nmirror, in an effort to appraise her wares.  Her hollow cheeks needed\\r\\nrouge.  Her dull eyes needed belladonna.  Her clothes were worn.  She\\r\\nfelt that she should start work immediately, but she was afraid.  She\\r\\nwent to bed and slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the next evening she had spent all but a dollar and some few cents\\r\\nof the seven dollars and a quarter that had remained to her.  With\\r\\nher bundles under her aching arm, she was returning to her\\r\\nlodging-house to prepare for work, when she stopped at the \"Ladies\\'\\r\\nEntrance\" of the corner-saloon and, going into a bare apartment for a\\r\\ndrink of whiskey, found, seated at a table, as the only other\\r\\ncustomer, the girl of whom she had asked her questions on the night\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child smiled as pleasantly as her hardened face would permit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello, kid,\" she said.  \"How\\'s tricks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello,\" replied Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit down here,\" said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary accepted her invitation, and gave the grinning waiter her order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Got settled?\" asked the girl, when the waiter had come and gone\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mary, \"I got a room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fifth door from here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl whistled.  She was proud of her knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That old cat Charlotte Michaels!\" she commented.  \"I bet she stuck\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She charges me seven dollars a week for a third-floor back\\r\\nhall-bedroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hell, that\\'s a steal.  Come next door to where I am, next week.\\r\\nThere\\'ll be a better room there, then, for a dollar less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at the child.  It seemed strange that she should be about\\r\\nto ask of one perhaps two years her junior for directions in the ways\\r\\nof the street; but she saw that the childishness before her was\\r\\nchildishness without innocence, was even lined and scarred by wisdom.\\r\\nShe wondered about her own face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m goin\\' to start out to-night,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the etiquette of this trade the workers ask no questions of one\\r\\nanother and offer few biographies save those fictitious ones, the\\r\\nthreadbare, unimaginative lies, which they reserve for their\\r\\ninquisitive purchasers.  Mary\\'s entertainer, therefore, put forward\\r\\nno inquiries save one:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"New in this town?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m new in the business,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child eyed her doubtingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come off,\" she good-naturedly replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am.  I was in a house onc\\'t, but I\\'m new to this, an\\' I ain\\'t\\r\\njust sure how to go about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said the child, \"it\\'s dead easy to learn the curves, but it\\'s\\r\\nthe hardest job in the world.  Can\\'t your fellow put you wise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fellow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure, your fellow, your friend, your sweetheart.  Honest, now; ain\\'t\\r\\nyou workin\\' for nobody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you ought to be.  Most all the girls is.  You can\\'t get along\\r\\nright without one.  Who\\'s goin\\' to go your bail when you\\'re pinched?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will I be pinched?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About as often as onc\\'t a month, kid--unless you let the cop call\\r\\nonc\\'t a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess I can stand him,\" said Mary.  She was past the stage of\\r\\nobjections.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll have to pay him anyhow, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought I might have to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you thought dead right.  Why don\\'t you get a fellow?  They\\'s\\r\\nlots of them.  They got political pulls.  Of course, they don\\'t leave\\r\\nyou much money for yourself, but they certainly can fix things up for\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you a fellow?\" asked Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sure have,\" said the child, grandly.  \"My girl friend an\\' I have\\r\\nhad one between us ever since we left school last June.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does he treat you right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As good as any.  He beats us up once in a while when we don\\'t earn\\r\\nenough, or when he\\'s more than usual lit up.  But he keeps the cops\\r\\naway, an\\' he gets us good trade, an\\' he\\'s true to the two of us.\\r\\nHe\\'d ought to be; we make good money for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary listened in a kind of awe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You like him?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love him,\" the child emphatically declared.  \"Lots of the girls\\r\\nhates their fellows, but daren\\'t leave \\'em because their fellows\\'d\\r\\nhave \\'em pinched right off--but I love mine.  You ought to get one.\\r\\nI\\'ll put you next.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Mary, \"I think I\\'ll wait; but I wish I knew the curves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, hell; it\\'s dead easy, I tell you.\"  The child gulped her whiskey\\r\\nand went on: \"You just put on your glad rags at eight o\\'clock an\\'\\r\\nwalk Broadway from Twenty-third to Forty-second.  If you can hustle,\\r\\nyou can land half a dozen before one o\\'clock.  When they give you the\\r\\nglad eye, take it, an\\' when they don\\'t, just you walk by \\'em sort of\\r\\nhummin\\' under your breath.  Stop an\\' look in the store-windows, an\\'\\r\\nthey\\'ll come like flies.  But always be sure to get your money first.\\r\\nAsk \\'em two dollars if they look that strong, or one if they\\'re cheap\\r\\nguys--but don\\'t ever take a cent less\\'n fifty cents.  I always gets\\r\\nthe two-plunk myself, unless a piker stands out for a dark corner or\\r\\nhallway and tries the quarter game: then I go through his clothes for\\r\\nall he\\'s got.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary rose, with averted eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" said the child.  \"You just take my tip, an\\'\\r\\nyou\\'ll make good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, if by managing, by the most detestible sort of work, to keep\\r\\nclothes upon her back, food in her stomach and a roof over her head,\\r\\nwas making good, Mary did it.  Everything fell out as the little girl\\r\\nhad described.  That night the adventurer, with no alternative, sank\\r\\nthe last of her scruples, and, when her room-rent next fell due, she\\r\\npaid it and had a margin of several dollars to place in her stocking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not, she found, very much to be saved, for the whole world\\r\\nseemed to mark her as legitimate prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the policemen were quick to see that she was an unprotected\\r\\nnewcomer, and, one by one, to stop her and threaten her with arrest.\\r\\nIn the beginning, she was afraid to slip them their tithes, and did\\r\\nit timidly and awkwardly; but, when she saw how jauntily and\\r\\ngraciously they accepted payment, she had the bills always ready at\\r\\nthe time when they were expected and, with the bills, the caresses\\r\\nthat, not infrequently, had to accompany them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther expenses were proportionate.  Rent gained upon the advance of\\r\\nprosperity.  Showy clothes, if not the best, were a necessity, and\\r\\nthe second-hand shops raised their prices on the suspicion of her\\r\\nprofession.  Rainy nights came, when there was almost no business to\\r\\nbe done.  The work was of a character that required sturdy food, and\\r\\nthis must be bought in restaurants tacitly conducted for her class\\r\\nand charging accordingly.  The men, she soon discovered, were as\\r\\nloath to buy her a supper as they were ready to buy her drinks, a\\r\\ncondition the sole consolation of which was the fact that alcohol\\r\\ndulled whatever remained of the fine edge of sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of her cursory Antonies, regarding their transactions as they\\r\\nregarded their other business affairs, were honest, but most were\\r\\nhonest only when they had to be, and to them Mary and her kind were\\r\\nbeasts of burden not worthy of the stipulated hire.  There were the\\r\\nlechers that wanted only to waste the busy minutes in unremunerative\\r\\ntalk; there were the seekers that endeavored to secure through\\r\\nhideous formulæ of affection what they were too mean frankly to\\r\\npurchase; there were the hypocritical male animals that, above\\r\\nsuspicion in their daylight life, considered the women of the night\\r\\nas fair game for cheating, and then there were the careful toads, who\\r\\nprided themselves upon their shrewdness, and who bargained and\\r\\nhaggled as a man would be ashamed to bargain and haggle for a dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a trade of hard hours, hard walking, and hard drinking, and,\\r\\nin the glaring cafés where she often sat with her fellow-workers\\r\\nwaiting to be smiled at by the hunters, Mary, though she met many\\r\\ngirls that fared worse than herself, met few that, when truthful,\\r\\ntold of faring better.  The woman that quitted her landlady\\'s care\\r\\nfor \"a flat of her own\" represented the ideal toward which this whole\\r\\narmy was hoping, but was an ideal mythical.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all were working in health and out, and saving nothing.\\r\\nNearly all were in bondage to taskmasters that slunk along after them\\r\\nthrough the streets, saw them strike a bargain, waited in the shadows\\r\\nof a nearby house until the wage was paid, and then came forward,\\r\\nbefore the customer had turned the corner, to exact their tribute.\\r\\nBorn, through the effects of a wasteful industrial system, in cellars\\r\\nupon beds of rags, herded as children in attics where a family of ten\\r\\nslept in a space too small for five, bred in poverty, always underfed\\r\\nand never properly protected from the weather, some of them were used\\r\\nto hardship that no decent social justice would ever have permitted.\\r\\nOthers had been lured from comfortable homes.  Still others were the\\r\\nfaster fettered because they had gone from homes too respectable to\\r\\nallow of any return.  But almost everyone, through fear of exposure,\\r\\ndread of jail and reformatory, and awe of their owners\\' political\\r\\ninfluences, was the chattel of a slavery as thorough as that of which\\r\\nMax Grossman was a minor instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of these toilers were ready to receive, or had long\\r\\nsince received, the seeds of tuberculosis; few could continue their\\r\\nwork for five years, and ninety-five per cent., as a drunken young\\r\\ncollege undergraduate one evening cheerfully informed Mary, were\\r\\nsuffering from one or other, and sometimes from all three, of the\\r\\ntrio of diseases common to their business.  Out from those stuffy\\r\\nbedrooms and those smoke-clouded, song-filled cafés, men carried the\\r\\nscourging social illnesses to innocent wives and to unborn children\\r\\ndestined to dwarfed or sightless lives.  The sufferer might believe\\r\\nhimself cured and bear infection years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, take yourself, for instance,\" the lad had resumed, his cheeks\\r\\nstill rosy with youth, but his eyes aflame with liquor.  \"I know\\r\\nsomething about these things; but I couldn\\'t tell whether you were\\r\\nfree or not.  You might be sick a long time before even you could\\r\\ntell, and then you wouldn\\'t risk starvation by telling about it.  You\\r\\nmight be sick right now for all I know.  But look out for the worst\\r\\nof all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary heard him with as little heed as she had heard most men.  She\\r\\nhad learned all that he said from women who knew more of it than, she\\r\\nhoped, this boy would ever know, and she had been well assured that\\r\\nit was a danger that no preventive could wholly defy and no care be\\r\\ncertain to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, she used to reflect, nothing much mattered.  She had\\r\\nnothing pleasant to look forward to and, therefore, she wisely\\r\\nrefrained, save for one advancing idea, from looking forward.  She\\r\\nhad no past that did not have its pain for her vision, and,\\r\\ntherefore, with this sole exception, she resolutely kept her eyes\\r\\nupon the present day.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet gradually one great passion was growing within her.  That process\\r\\nof thought which had begun in her encounter with Philip Beekman, when\\r\\nshe left his mother\\'s employment, had been hastened in its growth by\\r\\nwhat Marian Lennox had said and failed to do, and the shock of the\\r\\ngirl\\'s embarkation upon her new profession had only momentarily\\r\\nretarded it.  She was not large enough--few of us are--to see the\\r\\nconditions behind the individual, nor yet greatly to concern herself\\r\\nwith individuals that did not directly concern her; but she saw\\r\\nclearly her own plight, and now saw, or thought she saw, that this\\r\\nplight was due entirely to the machinations of the man who had taken\\r\\nher from her home and brought her to New York.  She could have loved\\r\\nhim, and so she hated him; she could still feel a tenderness for what\\r\\nhe might have been, so she permitted herself to feel only animosity\\r\\nfor what he had proved himself to be.  To him she traced directly all\\r\\nthat had befallen her, and as she could not go beyond him, so from\\r\\nhim, she slowly and finally resolved, she would exact payment.  That\\r\\nthought waxed in her tired mind; it was fed with every throe of her\\r\\npained body until it dominated her circumscribed outlook upon the\\r\\nworld.  It even saved her from suffering, because it so possessed her\\r\\nthat it armored her against all lesser things.  She had found, at\\r\\nlast, a purpose in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was almost coincident with her realization of this that Mary\\r\\nrealized something else.  She went immediately to a physician.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Helwig, a man with an enormous paunch and a round face and triple\\r\\nchin, was one of the many excellent practitioners that depend for\\r\\ntheir living--and it is a good one--upon the class to which Mary\\r\\nbelonged.  He treated the matter for what it was: a commonplace in\\r\\nhis day\\'s work.  At the end of a week he confirmed her fears.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment she reeled under the blow.  The bookcases with their\\r\\nponderous volumes in dark bindings, the shelves burdened with phials,\\r\\nthe glass medicine-case, the convertible table for minor operations,\\r\\nthe crowded desk, and even the fat physician before it, seemed to\\r\\nwhirl in a mad saraband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come!\" she heard the doctor say, as he thrust an uncorked\\r\\nbottle of smelling-salts under her nose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long will it last?\" she panted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must keep up our treatment for six months or a year,\" he\\r\\nanswered.  \"Meantime, diet and quiet.  No liquor.  If you were a\\r\\nmillionaire, I\\'d prescribe a long sea-voyage or a trip to Hot\\r\\nSprings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the chaos of her brain a sudden idea was shaping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What,\" she inquired, \"about other people catching this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew her business perfectly, and he knew that what he had to say\\r\\non this point would weigh but little in the scale against want.\\r\\nNevertheless, he made the common answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that she listened to all the instructions that he gave her.\\r\\nMore than ever now she had her purpose in life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE LEAST OF THESE\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA week later, in a lamp-lighted street, Mary and Carrie met.  Each\\r\\ngirl was too conscious of her own business to remark that it was the\\r\\nbusiness of her acquaintance, and each tried to avoid the other; but\\r\\nbefore recognition was complete they were face to face.  Silence was\\r\\nconfession.  Mary spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello,\" she said, \"it\\'s a long time since I seen you.  How are you,\\r\\nanyways?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie, though still a homely girl, wore a close-fitting coat that\\r\\nmade the best of her figure.  Her hat was wide and new and, as she\\r\\nanswered, she turned from the light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pretty well,\" she said, and paused short.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess,\" said Mary, \"you thought it was queer, my never comin\\' to\\r\\nsee you; but I haven\\'t had a single chance.  I\\'ll come soon, honest I\\r\\nwill.  How\\'s Katie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Carrie slowly answered, \"I\\'m not living with her any\\r\\nmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ain\\'t?  Since when ain\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know--a couple of weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You two didn\\'t scrap?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.  I had to go away.\"  And then, to divert the fire, Carrie added:\\r\\n\"Are you still working at that place the Settlement-people got for\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I left that long ago.  Have you gone back to the\\r\\nshirtwaist-factory?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I couldn\\'t: the strike was never settled, and, anyhow, they wouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave taken me back if I\\'d been willing to go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at the long coat and the gray hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, say,\" she began, \"you don\\'t look----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes dropped to Carrie\\'s and, suddenly, she knew.  Her voice\\r\\nsoftened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" she said.  \"I had to do it, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSilently they touched hands.  The Lithuanian\\'s breast rose and fell\\r\\nquickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I couldn\\'t do anything else,\" said Carrie, but only in explanation,\\r\\nnot in extenuation or excuse.  \"There was no other work I could do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And everywhere I went,\" continued Carrie, \"he followed me.  He was\\r\\nalways just behind me when I walked, always just around the corner\\r\\nwhen I stood still.  When I was dizzy and hungry, he always looked\\r\\nwell fed and always had the money in his hand.  He waited, waited,\\r\\nwaited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean your fellow?\" Mary asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie assented.  \"If you can call him that,\" she said.  \"He has two\\r\\nor three others working for him, or he\\'d be across the street now.\\r\\nI\\'m different from them--freer.  I\\'m not afraid of him, and so he is\\r\\na little afraid of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took the girl\\'s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They won\\'t let us stop this way on the pavement,\" she said.  \"Come\\r\\nin here and have a drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went into the women\\'s room of one of the quieter saloons.  Mary,\\r\\nmindful of the doctor\\'s directions, took only carbonated water, but\\r\\nCarrie ordered whiskey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, with her stomach crying out for the alcohol, and, in that\\r\\nwrenching desire, nearly seizing her companion\\'s liquor, sipped the\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve quit it,\" she averred.  \"It don\\'t pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most of the men make you take it,\" said Carrie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Mary admitted, \"but you can chuck it on the floor if you\\'re\\r\\nfly.\"  She took another sip of the water, and then asked: \"Why don\\'t\\r\\nyou shake this man if you\\'re not scared of him.  You can come with\\r\\nme, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wouldn\\'t be good business,\" Carrie declared.  \"I need somebody\\r\\nwith influence to look after me in case I\\'m arrested.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was silent for a minute, thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you\\'re right,\" she granted; \"there\\'s one of \\'em I\\'d like to\\r\\nfind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you sometime.--Look here: I don\\'t feel like workin\\'\\r\\nBroadway to-night, an\\' I\\'ve got some money.  Let\\'s do a dance-hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey \"did\" several.  At the first a mask-ball was in progress; the\\r\\nbachanalian guests had rented extravagant costumes; confetti was\\r\\ntossed by the onlookers, and swiftly shifting lights of red and blue,\\r\\nof green and purple, played upon the dancers, whose whirling shadows,\\r\\nmonstrously magnified, were thrown upon sheeted walls.  At another,\\r\\nthere was an explosion of obscene epithets followed by a fight, which\\r\\nmade retreat advisable; and at a third, the dances were so short and\\r\\nthe intervals provided for the solicitations of the waiters were so\\r\\nlong that both girls wearied of the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tenth Avenue they at last found, however, a place more to their\\r\\nliking.  It was the usual type of room, enlarged by tearing out the\\r\\nthin partitions that had once divided it into several tenements.  The\\r\\nlights shone sick through the clouding smoke, and the air was heavy\\r\\nwith the odors of dust, tobacco, alcohol, and sweat.  But the music\\r\\nwas lively, the floor crowded, and the little tables along the walls\\r\\nwere surrounded by laughing groups of drinking men and women.  Of the\\r\\nformer, though most were hollow-chested, pale-cheeked, hawk-nosed,\\r\\nsome showed clearly that they came to plunder; and if the majority of\\r\\nthe latter were gum-chewing working-girls still in their earliest\\r\\nteens, many were of the variety to which the two newcomers now\\r\\nbelonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary and her companion sat down at a table near the door.  They\\r\\nnodded to the burly, cigar-smoking \"Boss,\" who moved energetically\\r\\nabout, urging bloodless lads to find partners, and now and then\\r\\nhimself taking a turn with a neglected girl.  They exchanged familiar\\r\\ngreetings, though they had never before seen her, with the\\r\\nfalse-jeweled woman whose business it was to assist the boss in\\r\\nstimulating the dancers by precept and example.  And they watched the\\r\\nscene with a gaze grave and calculating.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a child of thirteen, with closed eyes and her peach-tinted cheek\\r\\nagainst her pimpled partner\\'s, undulated to the music, scarcely\\r\\nmoving her feet.  Nearby there whirled, like a dervish, a girl to\\r\\nwhose consumptive face the revolutions brought a glow that mimicked\\r\\nhealth.  Now and then a woman would leap from one of the tables,\\r\\nembrace an unembarrassed man about the neck and so waltz off with\\r\\nhim, at once passionate and mocking, both of them deaf to the\\r\\nplaudits of their spectators.  From time to time the lights were\\r\\nsuddenly extinguished, and the dance went on in the darkness amid a\\r\\nchorus of kisses, cries, and giggling.  Most of the boys and men, and\\r\\nnearly all of the little girls, were drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the dancers, doubtless plying his trade, Mary saw Rafael\\r\\nAngelelli, sleek and radiant in a new suit of pale buff.  He detected\\r\\nher a little later and, disposing of a pure-faced child, who had been\\r\\nin his arms, made a skillful way to his old acquaintance.  He shook\\r\\nMary\\'s reluctant hand and, nodding to Carrie as if she were a\\r\\nfamiliar friend, sat down between the two women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where you been?\" he affably inquired of Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out of town,\" said Mary, coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel shrugged his shoulders.  He knew she lied, but he rarely\\r\\ncontradicted a lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Meester Dyk\\' been lookin\\' all over theesa town for you, Violet,\" he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary did not like the news.  She was still afraid that she might be\\r\\nwanted in connection with her contradictory affidavits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel, however, readily reassured her.  Just what Dyker wanted he did\\r\\nnot, he said, know; but he was certain that it was something for her\\r\\nbenefit.  The magistrate had commissioned him to find her, and Angel\\r\\nhad been searching, sporadically, for several weeks, even tracing her\\r\\ncourse back to the employment-agency and to that Mrs. Turner\\'s where\\r\\nshe had first worked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Theesa woman say you steal,\" said the Italian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s a liar,\" answered Mary, hotly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She say she tol\\' you so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She tried to make out I took a cake of soap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she say after you leave she meess two dollar an\\' some silka\\r\\nstockin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That woman never wore no silk stockin\\'s in her life, an\\' there\\r\\nwasn\\'t two dollars in the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the Italian shrugged his shoulders.  He gave Mary to understand\\r\\nthat, in his opinion, any woman who could steal and did not was a\\r\\nfool, and that any woman who stole and acknowledged it was a worse\\r\\nfool.  But what, plainly, most interested him was the execution of\\r\\nhis commission from Dyker.  He talked so earnestly about it that he\\r\\nfailed entirely to lay Mary\\'s fears.  She refused to give him her\\r\\naddress, and as soon as he had left the table she endeavored to quit\\r\\nthe hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance of an acquaintance detained her.  There were words that\\r\\nhad to be said and drinks that had to be bought.  Half an hour\\r\\npassed, and then, as she started with Carrie for the door, Mary saw\\r\\nWesley Dyker standing outside.  He was wrapped in a heavy overcoat\\r\\nwith its military collar turned up about his chin and his black derby\\r\\npulled far over his eyes; but Mary feared him too much to fail of\\r\\nrecognition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There he is!\" she whispered, catching her companion\\'s arm.  \"The\\r\\nDago telephoned him.  I was afraid of that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEscape was hopeless.  She sent Carrie back to the dancers, and, going\\r\\nout, met Dyker, her head erect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard you was lookin\\' for me,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWesley raised his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said dryly; \"walk a block or two with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went for some time in silence, Mary too much upon the defensive\\r\\nto risk beginning a conversation, and Dyker trying in vain to command\\r\\nthe anger that had been growing with every day since he had learned\\r\\nhow she had betrayed him to Marian.  At the first dark street into\\r\\nwhich he turned her, his resentment burst its guard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What in hell do you mean by telling everybody all you know about\\r\\nme?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shrank away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you don\\'t!\" he said, and seized her hand.  \"Didn\\'t I do you the\\r\\nbest turn that was ever done you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" the woman quavered.  \"An\\' I wouldn\\'t pay you back the way you\\r\\nsay I done.  I never talked about you to nobody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t lie.  You know you did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary remembered, but she shook her head determinedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve never once spoke your name,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you to stop lying!\" rejoined Dyker.  \"You told it once at the\\r\\nSettlement on Rivington Street.  I know it.  I learned it there\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did I tell?\" asked Mary.  Her tone was defiant, but her\\r\\nendeavor was to draw his fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said I hung out at Rose\\'s,\" he protested.  \"You said I was her\\r\\nlover and yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never said I had nothing to do with you, Mr. Dyker.  I don\\'t care\\r\\nwho told you I did; I never said no such thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said I went to Rose\\'s.  I know you did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe confessed to that, for she was truly sorry for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I didn\\'t mean to, Mr. Dyker,\" she added; \"honest, I didn\\'t.  It\\r\\njust slipped out.  I didn\\'t know Miss Marian knowed you.  Why, she\\r\\ntold me she didn\\'t know you, an\\' how\\'d I ever think she\\'d lie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was a question which, ignorant of Miss Lennox\\'s precise method\\r\\nof evasion, Wesley did not, even to himself, attempt to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It didn\\'t matter whether she knew me or not,\" he said; \"you had no\\r\\nright to tell it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that.  It just slipped out.  But it won\\'t never happen again.\\r\\nI wasn\\'t so wise as I am now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not,\" he said, a trifle mollified by the sincerity in her\\r\\ntone.  \"But you\\'ve done me a big amount of harm there, Violet, and\\r\\nyou have got to undo it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer first sensation had been one of relief in finding that her false\\r\\naffidavit was not held against her; her next had been fright at his\\r\\nanger; but now she was all penitence for the ill she had wrought him.\\r\\nDyker was the one man in New York that had done her a kindness, and\\r\\nshe held that kindness as the greatest possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want?\" she asked.  \"I\\'d do most anything for you, Mr.\\r\\nDyker: you know that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were under the uncertain light of a crossing.  He eyed her\\r\\nnarrowly, mistrustingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want you,\" he replied, \"to come to my office to-morrow evening at\\r\\nsix.  Here\\'s my card.  Will you do it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the card and thrust it through the opening of her shirtwaist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want with me when you get me there?\" she wondered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want you to come with me to Miss Lennox, and deny the story that\\r\\nyou told her about me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s heart sank.  She could not bear the thought of facing Marian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the use o\\' that?\" she pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the use?  Why, how else are you going to put me right with\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I couldn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I couldn\\'t, Mr. Dyker.  Honest, I couldn\\'t.  She\\'d know I was lyin\\'\\r\\nto her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You leave that to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What excuse\\'d I give her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll fix that up to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please don\\'t make me do it, Mr. Dyker!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to.  What else can I do?--It\\'s all your own fault.  What\\'s\\r\\nyour address?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave it to him tremulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"I\\'ll have a cab there for you to-morrow at\\r\\nfive-thirty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer body shook with frightened sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Mr. Dyker,\" she repeated, \"please don\\'t make me do this!  I\\'d do\\r\\nanythin\\', \\'most, under the sun for you; but I can\\'t face Miss\\r\\nMarian--honest to God, I can\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat he should have done was to play upon her gratitude, but what he\\r\\ndid do was again to allow his mistrust and anger to have their rein.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t have any nonsense about this, Violet,\" he said.  \"If you\\r\\ndon\\'t come to my office to-morrow at six, I\\'ll have you arrested--and\\r\\nI\\'ll see to it that you won\\'t escape with a mere fine, either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It won\\'t----\"  She could not grasp it.  \"What do you mean?\" she\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean I\\'ll have you arrested on a big charge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer lips stiffened with that common terror of the law, about the only\\r\\nterror that the law ever succeeds nowadays in creating: the\\r\\nunreasoning terror that seldom serves as a deterrent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t done nothin\\' but this,\" she said, in the full knowledge that\\r\\nwhat she had or had not done would be no factor in the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll find out about that when the time comes,\" he answered.  \"What\\r\\nI want to know is whether you\\'ll do me this favor or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had stopped and confronted her.  Even in the semi-darkness her\\r\\nanxious eyes managed to read his pale, determined face, but even in\\r\\nthe daylight they could have found there no relenting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave him a despairing smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess I\\'ve got to,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, you\\'ll have to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll do it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do it, all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No bluff?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember: if you don\\'t, I\\'ll fix you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll not forget,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you don\\'t,\" he called after her, \"you won\\'t be sorry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t forget,\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, even as she walked away from him, the sickness of indecision\\r\\nwas upon her.  Like all narrow experiences, her narrow experience\\r\\nmade her afraid of everything beyond its own limits.  Her habit of\\r\\nlife was the habit of the weakened bird of prey that attacks only the\\r\\ndefenseless and flies before the strong.  She had become a moral\\r\\ncoward, and the progress of her physical disease directly accentuated\\r\\nthe insidious encroachments of her moral illness.  She could not\\r\\nopenly face Marian; she did not dare openly to defy Dyker.  She\\r\\nwanted only to run away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy four o\\'clock the next afternoon she had run away.  The night had\\r\\nbeen a wearisome journey backward and forward between the decision to\\r\\nobey the magistrate and the decision to evade him.  She thought that\\r\\nshe owed him much, but she knew that she could not successfully face\\r\\nMarian and lie.  She was tremblingly afraid of Wesley\\'s vengeance,\\r\\nbut she was more afraid of Marian\\'s honest eyes.  All day she lay\\r\\nupon her bed, dizzy from this circling process of thought, but at\\r\\nlast, in an attack of dread of the lie more severe than any that had\\r\\npreceded it, she flung her clothes into a little trunk, which she had\\r\\nrecently purchased, and, calling a cab, drove to a new lodging-house.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not go out that evening, but the next she had to go, and she\\r\\nhad not been on Broadway for two hours before a plain-clothes man\\r\\ntouched her arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry, kid,\" he said, \"but you\\'ve got to come along with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstinctively she recoiled, but the detective\\'s fingers had slipped\\r\\nto her wrist and tightened on it.  The sword had fallen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where to?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew the man.  She had given him money, and more than money, yet\\r\\nshe expected no mercy, expected nothing but an explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jefferson Market,\" said her captor.  \"But if you\\'ve got anybody\\r\\nhandy who\\'ll go your bail, I\\'ll take you to see him first, before we\\r\\ngo down to Ninth Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shook her head.  Helpless horror had her for its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No use,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certain sure,\" she said, and then, a little wistfully: \"I guess\\r\\nthere ain\\'t no good in tryin\\' to talk business to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective was a big, black-mustached man.  His face was not\\r\\nunkindly, but he was helpless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he said; \"this here\\'s orders from the front.  If you haven\\'t\\r\\ngot some fellow to be ready with bail, I guess we\\'d better hurry up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey crossed to Sixth Avenue and walked down that noisy thoroughfare\\r\\nto the towering brick fortress that stands like a castle to guard the\\r\\ngateway of old Greenwich Village.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy day that somber building seems to hide behind the grim planks of\\r\\nthe elevated railroad; it is ugly, neglected, innocent; under its\\r\\nprotecting wings are the stalls of white-aproned butchers and the\\r\\nopen establishments of green-grocers and hucksters plying their\\r\\nseveral occupations.  But no sooner does the darkness drop its\\r\\ncurtain over the webbed streets, the dirty courts, and the foul\\r\\nalleys that surround the place, than Jefferson Market ceases to be a\\r\\nbuilding for the dispensation of food and becomes a court for the\\r\\ndispensation of the commodity that we carelessly label Justice.  The\\r\\nhands of the large clock in the high tower are hurried toward the\\r\\nhour of twelve; long rays of sinister light are shot from windows\\r\\nnarrow and barred; and under a vaulted entrance-way there pours, from\\r\\nyear\\'s end to year\\'s end, an unending army of those women of the\\r\\nstreet who have lost, for one reason or another, their ability any\\r\\nlonger to purchase the protection of the Law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not often that what the statutes designate as crime comes to\\r\\nthe Night Court: Crime may wait for the morning.  It is the drunkard,\\r\\nthe vagrant, the licenseless pedlar, and, above all, unfriended Maria\\r\\nPeripatetica, the human being that humanity has spoiled in the\\r\\nmaking, who is taken there.  Above all, the Marias Peripateticæ that\\r\\nhave, once fostered by the Law, quarreled with it, failed to bribe\\r\\nit, or openly rebelled against it.  Black and white, short-skirted\\r\\nand gray-haired, besilked and bedraggled, from nine in the evening\\r\\nuntil early morning, five thousand in a twelvemonth, they are brought\\r\\nto the Jefferson Market Court for judgment from the power that has\\r\\nmade them what they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd judgment is what they receive.  The law is a mill that was made\\r\\nto grind out one thing, and can grind no other; the courts were\\r\\nconstituted to make criminals and to punish them, not to prevent or\\r\\nto cure; our present justice is not mercy; it is formulæ, not\\r\\nsentiment.  There is one woman that has some small authority in this\\r\\ntribunal, one woman that sees an occasional girl with some promise in\\r\\nher face and takes her away to Waverley House for observation and to\\r\\nbe given, if all goes well, a chance at other employment; but\\r\\nWaverley House is small, it is poor, and there is small chance for\\r\\nher that has been twice stricken.  One woman cannot do much against\\r\\nthe grinding mill, and the grinding mill, between January and\\r\\nDecember, sends only seventeen girls to a semi-sane reformatory as\\r\\ncompared to three thousand that it sends to the university of crime\\r\\nwhich is known as \"The Island.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was hurried up a short flight of stone steps and into a small\\r\\nhallway.  A metal gate was opened for her and snapped shut as she\\r\\npassed it.  A stocky man took her name and address and got, from her\\r\\nconductor, in a voice that she could not hear, the charge on which\\r\\nshe had been arrested, and then, after one turn to the left and\\r\\nanother to the right, she was shoved through a door and into a\\r\\nbrightly-lighted, heavily-barred detention-pen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDazedly, she looked about.  Beside her, upon one side, sat a\\r\\ngray-haired woman of sixty, too old any longer to earn that tribute\\r\\nwhich would have secured her immunity for the prosecution of the\\r\\ntrade she must recently have adopted.  Nearby was a girl of thirteen,\\r\\nwho, temporarily neglected by her owner, had been arrested for the\\r\\nsame offense.  On the bench sat a fat negress who informed all\\r\\nlisteners that she was falsely charged with picking the pocket of a\\r\\nbald-headed white man that she had solicited.  Over them all streamed\\r\\nthe pitiless light of strong lamps, upon them all were soon to feast\\r\\nthe eyes of the crowd in the near court-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newcomer bowed her head.  She did not know that a court-retainer\\r\\nhad been waiting her arrival.  She did not know that, as soon as she\\r\\nhad entered, this retainer had hurried to a telephone.  She did not\\r\\nknow that, in answer to this call, Rafael Angelelli had hurried to\\r\\nthe door that she had just passed, and there presented a note bearing\\r\\na potent signature.  She did not even know that these things were of\\r\\ncommon enough occurrence, and she was aware of only her misery until\\r\\nshe heard the Italian\\'s low voice and saw him beckoning her to the\\r\\nbars.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe almost ran toward him.  The other prisoners gathered about her,\\r\\nbut the officer that accompanied Angel waved them away, and himself\\r\\ndrew back.  Mary clutched the bars as if they had been a tangible\\r\\nhope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Angel!\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Angelelli fronted her, scowling.  He shook a tight fist under her\\r\\nshrinking eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a dam\\' fool!\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary could not articulate.  Her lips involuntarily found an unthought\\r\\nquery, but her voice was dumb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why you not leesten to theesa Wesley Dyk\\'?\" pursued Rafael.  \"Now\\r\\nmaybe you go to the Island.  You know what that mean?  Theesa jailers\\r\\ncut off your hair, beat you up every mornin\\', every evenin\\' regular.\\r\\nNo meals; only bread an\\' water; no wheeskey.  An\\' when you come out\\r\\nevery cop hava you\\' peecture an\\' you get arrest\\' each time an\\' senta\\r\\nback again to jail!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe believed him.  She would have believed anything that was said to\\r\\nher by someone she had previously known.  With a flow of ready tears\\r\\nthat blinded her sunken eyes, she begged him to tell her of some way\\r\\nof escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel was ready with his answer.  It seemed that he still represented\\r\\nWesley Dyker and that Mr. Dyker was not disposed to be so hard on her\\r\\nas impartial justice demanded that he should be.  In the back-room of\\r\\na nearby saloon there were a lawyer and a notary in waiting.  If Mary\\r\\nwould promise to swear to and sign before them a prepared paper\\r\\ndenying the accusations she had made to Marian, Angel would now, by\\r\\nmeans of a second note, see that the sitting magistrate did but fine\\r\\nher, and would hand her at once the amount of that fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had supposed that her arrest had been on the charge of larceny\\r\\nfrom Mrs. Turner\\'s boarding-house; she had not known that she was\\r\\naccused of no more than the practice of her trade, and she could\\r\\nscarcely credit news so good as this which Angel brought her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' I won\\'t have to go to Miss Marian?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.  Meest\\' Dyk\\' want thees paper for hees girl--jus\\' to square\\r\\nheemself witha hees girl--no more.  You go where you want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' the judge\\'ll let me off?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe promised, and a moment later was led into the court-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw the gaping, leering crowd, which filled half of that\\r\\napartment beyond the low grating.  She saw the stolid policemen\\r\\nherding their charges as stockyard hands herd cattle for the\\r\\nslaughter.  She saw the stealthy slavers buzzing in and out, bent\\r\\nupon nefarious rescue; the waiting lawyers on the outer bench and the\\r\\nlaughing lawyers inside, joking together or making mirth before the\\r\\ndesk at which, in his black robe, sat the weary, cynical, indifferent\\r\\nmagistrate, his face as expressionless as that of a Chinese Joss.\\r\\nShe heard, between the roars of elevated trains, the unintelligible\\r\\noaths, administered, as she now understood that the average oath is\\r\\nadministered, with a rapidity that robbed them of all dignity and\\r\\nmost effect; the drone of testimony constantly interrupted to the\\r\\npoint of confusion and always curtailed to the exclusion of essential\\r\\ntruth; the mechanical pronouncement of sentence that ended, as if the\\r\\ntwo things were on phrase, in the summoning of the succeeding case.\\r\\nAll this she saw and heard and disregarded.  She had been struck\\r\\ndown, trapped, held fast in the grip of the invisible enemy that she\\r\\nthought of as the City.  She had been conscious of nothing but the\\r\\nliving Fear, and now, Angel had told her, some portion of relief was\\r\\nat hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer arraignment, the payment of her fine, her meeting with the\\r\\nwaiting Italian, her progress to the nearby saloon where the lawyer\\r\\nand the notary were ready for her--all this passed like a vision of\\r\\nthe night.  She signed without reading it--though she would not have\\r\\nunderstood it if she had read it--the formal denial to which her\\r\\naffirmation was immediately affixed.  She was too dazed to think\\r\\nuntil, leaving the three smiling men behind her, she had turned again\\r\\ninto free Sixth Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then that she saw coming toward her a young man--a young man\\r\\nthat might have been anywhere from nineteen to thirty-two--with hair\\r\\nthat was dark and curly, sorely-shaven olive cheeks just showing the\\r\\ndefeated tokens of a blue-black beard; a dapper, prosperous young\\r\\nman, with thick lips and hard eyes and a smartly cut overcoat, from\\r\\none pocket of which flashed a brilliant-bordered handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the instant Mary\\'s exhaustion dropped from her brain and\\r\\nshoulders.  She forgot her fright of the earlier evening; she\\r\\nremembered only the sufferings from which it had arisen.  Her waiting\\r\\nhad not, after all, been vain.  She was calm, she was resourceful,\\r\\nshe was resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello, Max,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nJUDGMENT\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first he did not know her.  He stood there, while their eyes were\\r\\nlocked, in his own eyes no gleam of honest memory.  He was\\r\\nunchanged--the serene, the secure, the smug Max Grossman of that\\r\\nfirst meeting in the street of her little Pennsylvania town; but she,\\r\\nas she so well knew without this silent testimony, was not now, and\\r\\nnever again could be, the girl of that lost springtime.  He looked at\\r\\nher, his thick lips drawn thin in a professional grimace, and not\\r\\nuntil she spoke a second time did he recognize her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started then, and his olive face went pale; but Mary put out her\\r\\nhand precisely as if she were meeting, after a brief absence, only an\\r\\nacquaintance of the everyday friendly sort, and Max, too glad for\\r\\npardon to question motive, seized and squeezed her hand tenderly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhat?\" he cried in mock pleasure at this _contretemps_.  \"No, it\\r\\n_ain\\'d_!  I gan\\'t hardly belief mine eyes you\\'re lookin\\' so fine.\\r\\nBut it _is_ Mary Denbigh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled almost gayly.  In little she had to lie, but in much,\\r\\nthough for a reason that he must not suspect, she was indeed exultant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am lookin\\' good, ain\\'t I, Max?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe surveyed her cheap finery; saw her hair, disordered in her passage\\r\\nthrough the crowded court-room, and turned his gaze quickly from her\\r\\nhollow, painted cheeks, her hardening carmine mouth, and her heavily\\r\\nringed eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re _grand_,\" he said.  \"I always knew you\\'d make good, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You jollier!\" she laughed, and with her free hand, patted his olive\\r\\ncheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it\\'s _hon_est, so help me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then don\\'t you want to buy me a drink, Max?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrossman dropped her hand.  His face grew doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I vish I had _dime_,\" he said, \"but I god to see a friend down the\\r\\nAvenue, an\\'----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lady, Max?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach, no, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let him go.  You ought to be glad to take a walk with as\\r\\ngood-lookin\\' a girl as you say I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor another fleeting instant Max let his eyes rest on her face, then\\r\\nlowered them.  He looked at the pavement and drew an awkward line\\r\\nupon it with the edge of his tan boot-sole.  More significant than\\r\\nany physical change in her was the fact that she could now embarrass\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know, Mary,\" he stammered; \"but, you see, this here feller vhat I\\r\\ntol\\'----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed again.  She thrust her arm through his and turned his\\r\\nface uptown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forget it!\" she said.  \"Don\\'t you worry, Max; I ain\\'t goin\\' to rake\\r\\nthings up, if that\\'s what\\'s souring you.  Life\\'s too short.  All I\\r\\nwant is a talk and a drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf reluctantly, he let her lead him; but she could lead him and\\r\\nthat sufficed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lit an American cigarette and puffed it nervously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve just been in there,\" she said, with a backward jerk of her head\\r\\nin the direction of the police-court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There?\"  Max was not surprised, but he added: \"Vhat vas you doin\\' in\\r\\nthere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think?\" responded Mary.  She herself was thinking\\r\\nrapidly--about other things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You vasn\\'t in drouble?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess you would call it that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pinched?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had asked her no questions about her past--but concerning her\\r\\npresent he chanced a query.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary,\" he inquired, \"do you mean they god you up fer your beesiness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s about it,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But vhy don\\'t you square you\\'self vith the goppers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know.  I--I was broke, Max.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I vish I gould _help_ you, Mary,\" he said, his curiosity cooling at\\r\\nthe thought of an appeal for assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw it, and it amused her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you do it?\" she asked, dropping her voice into a whine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to draw away from her, but her linked arm held him\\r\\naffectionately fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I been havin\\' rotten luck,\" he declared; \"somethin\\' awful.  I ain\\'t\\r\\ngot hardly only the money vhat\\'s in my _glothes_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said Mary, looking at the clothes and knowing well that\\r\\nthey somewhere concealed an ample yellow sum, \"why don\\'t you take me\\r\\non your staff?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary,\" he cried, trying to spread his hands, and failing dismally\\r\\nwith the one that her pinioning arm hampered, \"vhat do you think I\\r\\nam?  A millionaire?  I ain\\'t got no staff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come off!\" she bantered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t--honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still in the other line?\" she persisted.  \"I thought you might be\\r\\ntrottin\\' \\'em on the street--they say there\\'s more in it.  Why do you\\r\\nstick to supplyin\\' the flats and the houses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice was the perfection of good nature, but he writhed under it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary!\" he pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" she said, disregarding his tone, and keeping his arm fast in\\r\\nher own, \"you do supply \\'em, don\\'t you?  I know one fellow who makes\\r\\nhis livin\\' goin\\' the rounds, findin\\' what girls is sore on their\\r\\nmadams an\\' then gettin\\' a commission by sneakin\\' \\'em out an\\' changin\\'\\r\\n\\'em to new flats.  He lets on he\\'s sellin\\' kimonas, but one sample\\'s\\r\\nlasted him three years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary!\" repeated Max, more weakly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the truth,\" she said, and then: \"But can\\'t you start\\r\\nstreet-work an\\' take me on your staff?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he looked at her,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not young enough lookin\\' now, eh?\"  She was still smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ach,\" he protested, \"you oughtn\\'t nod to be so _hard_ on a feller.\\r\\nIf you chust knowed----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had gone far enough, and she would not let him finish.  They\\r\\nhad reached a saloon near to her new lodging-place, and she paused.\\r\\nThere was, and she knew it, no word in his excuse that she would have\\r\\ncredited.  Nor did she mean, just yet, to let him see her hatred.  In\\r\\norder that he might the better see it at a later moment, she wanted\\r\\nnow to quiet his naturally ready fears.  She had found that she could\\r\\nharass him, and that, for the present, was all that she needed to\\r\\nknow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind,\" she said, \"I told you I wasn\\'t goin\\' to rake up\\r\\nnothin\\', an\\' I mean to keep my word.  Come on in here.  This is a\\r\\nquiet place.  You\\'re goin\\' to buy me a drink, anyhow, just to show\\r\\nthat we\\'re still friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brightened at this indicated avenue of escape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Sure_ we\\'re still friends,\" he declared, \"an\\' you can haf all you\\r\\nvant to _drink_, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe slipped her hand into his--she could do it, she had learned,\\r\\nwithout the dumb flesh seeming to shrink from that contact--and\\r\\npressed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went into the deserted \"ladies\\' room\" of the saloon to which she\\r\\nhad referred, and sat down there, facing each other under a light\\r\\nturned kindly low.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vhiskey?\" asked Max.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two of \\'em,\" ordered Max of the waiter that had answered his ring,\\r\\n\"an\\' don\\'d make \\'em so _stingy_ like most you fellers ofer this vay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man brought the liquor, placed it before them, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell,\" said Max, raising his glass, smiling his thin smile, and\\r\\napparently forgetting that he had ever denied whiskey; \"here ve are,\\r\\n_ain\\'t_ it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Mary was remembering another night and another drink she did not\\r\\nsay so; instead, as Max tilted his sleek head far back between his\\r\\nshoulders and dropped the whiskey down his throat, her hand watched\\r\\nfor the instant when his gray eyes were on the ceiling and that\\r\\ninstant poured the liquor from her own glass to the floor.  When her\\r\\ncompanion\\'s head came forward her fingers, wrapped about the glass,\\r\\nwere just withdrawing it from her lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can drink that better\\'n I used to,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMax grinned again.  So long as she did not upbraid him for his part\\r\\nin it, so long as she did not go into the details of its earlier\\r\\nstages, he had no objection to hearing of her past, was even\\r\\nlanguidly curious about it, and was certainly sorry that it had not\\r\\nbrought her to more seeming prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You sure didn\\'t take that like you vasn\\'t _used_ vith it,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take another just to show you how,\" she answered, and pressed\\r\\nthe nearest button.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time his eyes were on her and she had to drink.  But she did not\\r\\nscruple: so long as she retained her head and Max lost his, the\\r\\neffect of the alcohol on her system concerned her but little.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had a third drink, for \"old time\\'s sake,\" as Mary suggested, and\\r\\nthis she succeeded in pouring down her dress-front.  At the fourth,\\r\\nMax began to show signs of fear that he would have a drunken woman on\\r\\nhis hands, but Mary\\'s patent sobriety soon reassured him, and\\r\\novercame his protests against a fifth by recalling his promise of\\r\\nliberality.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis cold eyes sparkled into a faint light.  Little spots of red\\r\\nappeared in the olive of his cheeks.  He felt the advance of the\\r\\nenemy in his veins and tried to go; but Mary began an imaginative\\r\\nnarrative of her recent experiences and insisted on his listening.\\r\\nWhen he at last successfully interrupted that, she twitted him with\\r\\nbeing able to drink less than his pupils, and Max was once more\\r\\nforced to order.  He was not drunk, or nearly drunk, but the fine\\r\\nedge of his discretion was dulled: he saw in the woman, who had now\\r\\nmoved to his side, nothing that, whatever motives might be at work,\\r\\ncould possibly harm him; he found something ludicrous in the\\r\\nsituation.  Her looks seemed better than they had appeared an hour\\r\\nearlier, and her tentative advances flattered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though she had drunk more than was good for her, had managed to\\r\\nspill enough liquor to retain all the sobriety she needed; but, when\\r\\nthey at last rose, she swayed a little unsteadily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" she said, \"you\\'ll just buy me a half-pint for my head in the\\r\\nmornin\\', an\\' then you\\'ll walk as far as my door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill enjoying the piquancy of the affair, he obeyed her.  He even\\r\\nconsented to come to her hall-bedroom with her--a room the exact\\r\\nreproduction of that which she had formerly rented farther\\r\\nuptown--and there, forgetful of the provision against the morning,\\r\\nthey finished the half-pint.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he stood up from the bed on which he had been sitting while\\r\\nshe, opposite, used the single chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vell,\" he said, grinning; \"it\\'s been good to see you again, und\\r\\nmaybe I\\'ll gome back some efenin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose before him.  The light was at her back and her face resumed,\\r\\nas she stood there, some furtive traces of its earlier grace.  The\\r\\neyes seemed to soften, the cheeks were a natural pink beneath their\\r\\ncoating of rouge, and her russet hair, curling about her face,\\r\\nrelieved the harder outlines and cast a gentle shadow around the\\r\\nneck.  She spread out her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kiss me,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled and leaned condescendingly toward her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s your hurry?\" she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her, and the weak light and the strong liquor stood her\\r\\nin good stead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t in no hurry,\" he smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe met him smile for smile--and then, in a sudden sense of triumph,\\r\\nshe flung back her head and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until three hours later that he finally left her, but he\\r\\nleft hurriedly, for the remorseless gray light of morning was coming\\r\\nin at the window, and it fell upon her as she wrapped a soiled pink\\r\\nkimona around her shivering figure and slipped her feet into a pair\\r\\nof rundown Turkish slippers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-by,\" he said, looking away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Mary.  \"I\\'ll go with you to the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did go.  She followed him down the dark stairway, creaking\\r\\nnoisily under their shamed feet, and she stood for a moment in the\\r\\nblack hall, holding the brass knob of the door, as he passed to the\\r\\nstep outside.  Mary slipped the dead-latch, ready to bolt the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Max,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned quickly, nearly knocking over, as he did so, the\\r\\nmilk-bottles that were lined, in a white row, upon the step.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes?\" he returned, and grinned sheepishly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thrust out her towsled head and looked up and down the gray\\r\\nmorning street.  The block was empty.  She drew her head clear of the\\r\\ndoor.  She was still trembling, but from neither cold nor fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ain\\'t goin\\' without kissin\\' me?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a reaction of disgust had seized him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s one hand tightened on the knob; the other flattened itself\\r\\nagainst the nearest panel of the door, ready to push hard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" she replied, with a sudden change in her voice that,\\r\\nstill low, became tense and metallic.  \"You think I\\'m--I\\'m done for,\\r\\nMax.  Well--_you\\'re done for, too!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\'s jaw dropped.  His olive face was ashen.  His eyes stared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s mouth was wreathed in a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMax retreated so suddenly that he nearly fell down the stone steps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve--you\\'ve----\" he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a lie!  You\\'re tryin\\' to scare me!\"  His jaw worked\\r\\nspasmodically.  \"It\\'s a damned lie!\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t believe me?\" the girl inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she had looked for heroics, if she had feared melodrama, she was\\r\\nas yet disappointed.  The knees of Max shook under him; he was in\\r\\nabject terror.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a lie,\" he muttered over and over.  \"It\\'s a damn\\' lie!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think what you please,\" said Mary.  She was still smiling, still\\r\\nserene.  \"You believed I\\'d forgot, didn\\'t you?  Well, I didn\\'t\\r\\nforget, Max Grossman, an\\' now you\\'ll remember.  If you don\\'t yet\\r\\nthink I\\'m givin\\' you a straight story, all you have to do is just one\\r\\nthing: _wait_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMax uttered an inarticulate cry and threw himself at her, but he only\\r\\nbashed his head against the closed door.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had shut it, and in time.  Behind it, in the dark hallway, she\\r\\nlay half fainting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the last of you, Max,\" she laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nHUSKS OF THE SWINE\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was too ill to go to work that night, and on the night following\\r\\nshe was no better.  The shock, the spasm of success, the recoil, not\\r\\nmoral but physical, after the satisfaction of a supreme desire--these\\r\\nthings were, of themselves, enough to leave her prostrate.  But, in\\r\\naddition to these, she had, while standing at that open door,\\r\\ncontracted one of those heavy colds to which she was now rendered\\r\\nespecially susceptible.  Through long hours of the day and the\\r\\ndarkness she tossed among the hot sheets of her bed, sometimes with\\r\\nher teeth clicking in a chill, again with her body burning in a\\r\\nfever, but always revolving in her seething brain the details of the\\r\\nvengeance that she had wrought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer physical sufferings mattered little to her.  There were hours\\r\\nwhen she was wholly incapable of feeling them.  When the inertia of\\r\\nthe state of reaction began at last to wear away, it left her with a\\r\\nglow of recollection so great that there seemed no place for lesser\\r\\nsensation.  She had accomplished her great work, she had achieved her\\r\\nmission.  What she had done had been done solely for her own heart\\'s\\r\\nsake; there had been no delusion of a celestial command, no distorted\\r\\nthought of a social duty; yet, the impulse, however utilitarian, had\\r\\nbeen supreme, and its end filled her with a sense of triumph that,\\r\\nfor want of the proper title, she was sure was happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wiser head and an unwounded heart would have known enough of life\\r\\nto see that even Max Grossman was not entirely to blame.  A better\\r\\nbrain could have looked back into the past.  It could have seen Max\\r\\nas the type of all his kind, the symbol of every one of the great\\r\\ncompany of slavers, the inevitable result of a system blind both to\\r\\nits own interests and to the interests of the race.  It could have\\r\\nseen the child, one of half a dozen born to a woman that could not,\\r\\nproperly, have cared for three.  It could have seen that child\\r\\nneglected, dirty, forgotten, locked, by day, in the bedroom where the\\r\\nwhole family tried vainly to sleep by night, learning the highest\\r\\nfacts of life from the worst of teachers: the cramped childish\\r\\nbrain--and going out, at last, upon the street, with passions\\r\\nprematurely developed and perverted.  It could have seen the social\\r\\norder shape that child into society\\'s enemy: the starved\\r\\nboy-pickpocket sent to the monstrously misnamed \"reformatory\"; the\\r\\nsame child branded as a criminal, with none to shelter or to trust\\r\\nhim, and with a knowledge, gained in the state\\'s own institution,\\r\\nwhich fitted him to be only a crafty gorilla to harass the state.  It\\r\\ncould have seen the fatal line of least resistance as clearly in the\\r\\nresultant man as it is seen in the life of him that does no more than\\r\\nwreck a bank or steal a corporation, and, hideous as its course is in\\r\\nthe one instance, it would have seen that the line was the same in\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary never doubted her justice, and never regretted it.  One only\\r\\nthought troubled her: she was afraid that, by telling Max, she might\\r\\nhave given him a warning sufficiently early to defeat her own\\r\\nultimate purpose.  It was a large part of her plan that he should\\r\\nknow whose hand had struck him, and, for a man in his business, the\\r\\nonly way in which she could make that knowledge certain was the way\\r\\nthat she had followed.  Yet what if he were in time to profit by her\\r\\ninformation?  What if, even were he too late, he should guard and\\r\\ndoctor himself with proper caution?  She turned the questions over\\r\\nand over in her mind, but she had always to end in the faith that the\\r\\nworst had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, in the moments of exhaustion from the mad round of these\\r\\ninquiries, she reverted for relief to matters that touched her less\\r\\nnearly, and endeavored to occupy herself with the affairs of others.\\r\\nShe thought of Dyker, and without resentment.  She knew that he would\\r\\nuse her written retraction to regain Marian\\'s confidence, and she\\r\\nhoped that he would be successful.  Again she fell to speculating\\r\\nupon the fate of Carrie Berkowicz and to wondering what had become of\\r\\nKatie.  But upon her own past and present she did not permit herself\\r\\nto dwell, and always, with the certainty of a machine, her brain\\r\\nrecurred to Max and her vengeance on him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third evening, however, her landlady, entering with supper,\\r\\nreminded her, without mincing matters, that the rent was due, and\\r\\nMary recalled that her little stock of money was exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you wait till to-morrow morning, Mrs. Foote?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Foote was an ample woman, with round cheeks and robust frame,\\r\\nwhose only dissipations were an over-indulgence in ritualism, babies,\\r\\nand the hospital.  She had a high-church cleric to whom she confessed\\r\\nthe sins of her neighbors; a wraithlike husband whose sole occupation\\r\\nappeared to be that indispensable to the regular increase of her\\r\\nfamily--and whom she would otherwise have failed altogether to\\r\\ntolerate--and such a passion for being ill that she could never quite\\r\\nbelieve in the illnesses of others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can wait just that long, Miss Morton,\" she said; \"but I\\'m\\r\\nsufferin\\' so from rheumatism in my fingers that I just know my old\\r\\ngastric trouble is comin\\' on ag\\'in, an\\' that\\'ll mean another of them\\r\\nhospital-bills.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary raised her aching head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You won\\'t have to wait any longer,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad of it, Miss Morton,\" responded Mrs. Foote, \"for there was a\\r\\nyoung lady lookin\\' at this room to-day an\\' she offered me a dollar\\r\\nmore a week for it, an\\' I wouldn\\'t like to lose you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You won\\'t lose me,\" said Mary, to whom even sustained conversation\\r\\nwas physical pain.  \"I\\'m goin\\' out to-night, an\\' I\\'ll have plenty for\\r\\nyou by the mornin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re sure?\" asked the landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I am.  It\\'d be a pity if I couldn\\'t earn that much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Foote looked at Mary\\'s face and seemed to doubt the foundation\\r\\nfor her assurance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" she sighed, \"I certainly hope you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes after the door closed, Mary lay still.  She had\\r\\nagain been brought face to face with the most poignant of tragedies,\\r\\nthe tragedy of living.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour earlier, had she questioned herself, she would have said that\\r\\nshe was careless of life, that neither this earth nor the quitting of\\r\\nit interested her, that continued existence was a matter of\\r\\nindifference.  Then she was in that state of exultation above things\\r\\nmundane which is produced only by great sorrow, great joy, or the\\r\\ngreat revenges that are both grief and triumph.  But now the words of\\r\\nthe landlady had brought her back from the indulgence of\\r\\ncontemplation to the necessity of action.  Mary\\'s insidious,\\r\\nimplacable disease had completed what her business had begun, and\\r\\nwhat her business alone would have completed far more slowly.  The\\r\\nfew emotions that she was now capable of feeling were the more\\r\\nintense because of their rarity, but their intensity was equaled by\\r\\ntheir brevity and, when the moment had gone, it left her even more of\\r\\na moral weakling than it had found her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew Mrs. Foote and her tribe too well to deceive herself as to\\r\\nwhat must happen should the morning dawn upon an empty stocking.\\r\\nLife held nothing for which Mary greatly cared, but the instant of\\r\\ndeath contained all of which she was afraid.  She did not greatly\\r\\nwant to harm others by plying her trade in her present condition, but\\r\\nshe could not think of others.  Each step would be a separate wound\\r\\nto her tortured body and her throbbing head, but she understood that\\r\\nthe landlady had to wring out the rents by the means that conditions\\r\\nhad forced upon her; and so the worst of fears, the fear of poverty,\\r\\nwhich is the fear of death, took this sick woman from her bed,\\r\\ndressed her in her best frock, and sent her out into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong Sixth Avenue, where fortune had often, theretofore, been kind\\r\\nto her, she met no significant glances.  A passing girl or two,\\r\\nhaving missed her for the last few evenings, proffered a casual\\r\\nsympathy; but that was all.  Through the open doors of the Haymarket,\\r\\nshe turned in, but there even the women at first disregarded her.\\r\\nSeveral men that she recognized in the boxes of the gallery around\\r\\nthe little hall nodded, but immediately looked away.  The one man\\r\\nthat she happened to know better than any of the others did not\\r\\nappear at all to remember her, and his neighbor, who had frequently\\r\\naccompanied her, signaled elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was lonely.  She approached two women who were circling the\\r\\nfloor, arm in arm.  She addressed them with the familiarity of the\\r\\ncraft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one woman smiled, but her companion, a formidable, tailor-made\\r\\npersonage, swelled with dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You better beat it,\" she declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s eatin\\' you?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t belong here,\" the woman answered.  She made a lofty survey\\r\\nof Mary\\'s finery, and then added: \"Goin\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s heart sickened, but she stood her ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she said, \"I ain\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe floor-manager was passing.  The social arbiter turned to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will,\" she asked, and her shrill voice seemed to carry over all the\\r\\nroom; \"what\\'s this place comin\\' to?  Throw that Fourteenth Street\\r\\nwoman out o\\' here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough.  Mary left the place, and, still aching in every\\r\\nlimb, turned through a narrow cross-street to Broadway.  Her eyes\\r\\nswam as she lingered before shop-windows in the hope that someone she\\r\\npassed would accost her.  Her throat was dry and it hurt her when she\\r\\nhummed into the ears of careless pedestrians.  Nobody seemed to heed\\r\\nher.  The night was cold, and she shook like a recovering drunkard.\\r\\nShe mastered all her strength to speak plainly to a complacent man in\\r\\na great ulster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" she said, trying to smile.  \"What\\'s your hurry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked at her and swore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must think I\\'m blind,\" he ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew that she looked ill, but she knew that she must find money.\\r\\nShe pleaded with age, because she knew it to be æsthetically\\r\\ntolerant; she ogled youth, because she knew it to be inexperienced;\\r\\nand she stationed herself at last near a saloon in a poorly lighted\\r\\nquarter, because she concluded that the men leaving such places were\\r\\nthe only men to whom she was just then fitted successfully to appeal.\\r\\nIt was one o\\'clock in the morning before she could induce even one of\\r\\nthese to give way to her, and he, staggering with drink so that she\\r\\nhad to support him with all her ebbing powers, insisted on stopping\\r\\nin an alleyway when, for the first time, she picked a pocket.  A\\r\\ndollar and a half was all that she had as she left him, and the next\\r\\ndark figure that she stopped--she did not look at his face or care\\r\\nwhat sort of face it was--answered her with sharp laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A two-spot?\" he cackled.  \"You have a few more thinks comin\\', old\\r\\ngirl!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A dollar?\" suggested Mary, tremulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got just a half--an\\' you ain\\'t worth a cent more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it--what would she not have taken?--and she worked on into\\r\\nthe dawn, on with a mounting fever and a sick determination, knowing\\r\\nnow that her chances grew with the approach of morning and finding\\r\\nherself, when at last the morning came, with scarcely a dollar beyond\\r\\nthe sum due for rent.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all the months that followed she skirted the dire edge of\\r\\nstarvation, more than half the time too ill to rise from her bed and\\r\\naware that she was at no moment fit to rise.  As her cold grew\\r\\nsteadily better her deeper illness steadily increased.  It thrived on\\r\\nevery exertion and seemed to gain each atom of strength that she\\r\\nlost.  Things might thus continue for almost any period, but she knew\\r\\nthat her manner of life forbade absolute cure, and that, at the end,\\r\\nthere waited a slow and loathsome death.  Anticipation made her\\r\\nfaint; the melancholia and terror, which are symptomatic, sometimes\\r\\nnearly maddened her.  The last vestiges of the moral sense, so early\\r\\ninjured by previous experience, were almost wholly destroyed; there\\r\\nwas no social consciousness; the appeal of the individual widened\\r\\nuntil it occupied her entire horizon; there was room for nothing but\\r\\nthe craven passion for life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFat Dr. Helwig, when she went to see him, blinked at her out of his\\r\\ndeep-set eyes, and told her that she was not taking sufficient rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary twisted her helpless hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can I afford to take it?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Save your money,\" said he, patting her thin shoulders, and chuckling\\r\\nprosperously.  \"You girls never put aside a cent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We don\\'t earn enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poof!  That\\'s what you all say.  I know--I know.  We men aren\\'t such\\r\\nfools as you take us for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary, as each evening she made up before her little mirror, noted\\r\\nthe gradual depreciation of her wares; each week she found it harder\\r\\nto pay rent and retain enough money for food.  Mrs. Foote seemed to\\r\\ncome every day, instead of every seventh, and yet each night business\\r\\ngrew more difficult.  Whenever Mary missed a few evenings, or\\r\\nwhenever she changed her hunting-grounds, the police needed fresh\\r\\npayments.  She surrendered one uptown cross-street after another.  At\\r\\nlast she deserted Broadway and patrolled only that Fourteenth Street\\r\\nwhich the woman at the Haymarket had so scornfully referred to and\\r\\nwhich had so wonderfully burst upon Mary\\'s sight when she first\\r\\nstepped from the Hudson Tunnel upon the surface of Manhattan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring, summer, and autumn passed, and a lean winter followed them.\\r\\nMary caught another cold and was ill for a week.  She went to work\\r\\ntoo soon and had to go back to bed for several days and remain idle\\r\\nfor several nights.  At last, with the ancient fear of the white\\r\\nrace--the fear of that poverty which is death--gnawing at her vitals,\\r\\nshe struggled to her feet and tramped once more along Fourteenth\\r\\nStreet from Sixth Avenue to Third.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now the sword descended.  Even the Fourteenth Street saloon best\\r\\nknown for her purposes gave no fish to her net, and Eighth Street was\\r\\nlittle better.  She was too tired to go farther; she had, the next\\r\\nmorning, to offer Mrs. Foote only a third of what was due.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady, whose bulk seemed to crowd the hall-bedroom, leaned\\r\\nheavily against its frail door.  Mary thought the woman\\'s slow, brown\\r\\neyes more than commonly suspicious and her round face implacably\\r\\nhard.  The tenant, with all explanation frozen upon her lips, handed\\r\\nover the clinking bits of money.  They fell into the big, extended\\r\\npalm as a few drops of water might fall into a basin.  Mrs. Foote\\r\\nbegan slowly to count the coins.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary watched, in fascinated silence, the counting of those few pieces\\r\\nof silver, each one of which seemed stained with her blood.  She saw\\r\\nthe landlady\\'s expression change to one of incredulity.  She saw the\\r\\ncounting repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Foote again thrust out her grimy fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s----\"  Mary looked at the floor.  \"It\\'s the rent,\" she\\r\\nconcluded, in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_What\\'s_ the rent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all I have--just now.  I thought--I thought, considerin\\' how\\r\\nlong I\\'ve been here, you might wait a day for the rest, Mrs. Foote.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady opened her hand, and Mary\\'s little store of coin dropped\\r\\nto the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t take this,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean,\" asked Mary, with a quick gasp of hope, \"that you\\'ll let\\r\\nme keep it till I get the rest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t mean nothin\\' of the sort,\" said Mrs. Foote.  \"I mean\\r\\nI\\'ve got to have the whole bill--right now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s heart sank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all I have,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had sunk to a seat on the tumbled bed, beside her scattered\\r\\ncoins.  Her thin hands were locked across her knees; the dirty pink\\r\\nkimona slipped lower from her shoulders at every frequent cough, and\\r\\nher eyes sought those of Mrs. Foote in dumb appeal.  Her russet hair\\r\\nfell dully disordered about her hollow cheeks, and the rouge on her\\r\\nlips was purple.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" pursued Mrs. Foote, who was too used to such incidents\\r\\ngreatly to concern herself; \"but I\\'ve got to make my living like\\r\\nanybody else does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was expectin\\' some money this evenin\\',\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hump!\" sniffed the landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t believe that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care, Miss Morton; I can\\'t care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I\"--Mary\\'s fingers knotted tighter about her knees--\"I was\\r\\npromised it,\" she lied, \"an\\' I\\'m dead sure to get it then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard that so many times,\" said Mrs. Foote, \"that I knowed it\\r\\nby heart three year\\' ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could pawn somethin\\',\" suggested Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady swept the bare room with a critical glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no adequate answer to be made.  Mary had tried to pledge\\r\\nher coat a few days before, and had been offered only an inadequate\\r\\ntwenty-five cents for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you won\\'t--you can\\'t wait?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I can\\'t.  I\\'m a sick woman myself; my rent\\'s due, Miss Mary, an\\'\\r\\nthe honest truth is that there\\'s such a lot of women wantin\\' rooms\\r\\nthat I\\'d only be doin\\' a injustice to my children not to take in a\\r\\nlady that could pay prompt--for a while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary said nothing more.  She packed her few belongings into her\\r\\ntrunk, left it in the hall to be called for, and, as the chill\\r\\nevening fell, went away from the house with no idea where she was to\\r\\nfind a lodging for the night.  For an hour, though she was still\\r\\nweak, and the time was as yet so early, she walked up Broadway and,\\r\\nin the Forties, turned eastward for a few blocks, and so south again.\\r\\nNot far from the Grand Central Station she saw a little crowd\\r\\ngathered at a corner, and she stopped, rather for the luxury of\\r\\nstanding still than from any curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was a church.  Colored lights streamed from its rich\\r\\nstained-glass windows.  Through its swinging doors there stole the\\r\\nscent of flowers and the sound of delicate music.  A long row of\\r\\ncarriages, the coachmen walking up and down to keep warm, stretched\\r\\nfar around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, shivering, worked her way quietly through the group of men and\\r\\nwomen on the sidewalk.  In order to avoid a particularly entangled\\r\\nportion of the press, she started to walk along the steps by the\\r\\ntower-entrance, and then, seeing a side-door open, she listlessly\\r\\nturned toward it and looked in.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar away up the vaulted nave the altar stood, white with damask and\\r\\nyellow with candles.  The chancel was a garden, the whole building\\r\\nheavy with scent.  Acolytes in scarlet were grouped about the robed\\r\\npriests.  The choir had risen and, preceded by a lad that bore aloft\\r\\na great brass cross, were forming into a singing procession, which\\r\\nslowly filed down the center aisle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a subdued scuffle and swish, the congregation also rose as the\\r\\ndouble line of choristers moved between them.  Women craned their\\r\\nnecks and men, pretending to look stolidly ahead of them, looked\\r\\nreally out of the corners of their eyes.  The choir, at the main\\r\\ndoor, divided and stood still.  High overhead a deep-toned organ was\\r\\nplaying the wedding-march from Lohengrin, and through the respectful\\r\\nline of white-clad boys there moved a man of regular features with\\r\\nlowered lids that hid his eyes, and a crisp brown mustache, which\\r\\nconcealed his lips, and, on his arm, in the costume of a bride, a\\r\\ntall, graceful, pure woman, whose face was like a Greek cameo and in\\r\\nwhose hand was a huge bunch of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fingers of a policeman touched Mary\\'s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll have to get back,\" he said.  \"The people\\'ll be comin\\' out in\\r\\na minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary did not wish to move.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a right here,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You?\" The policeman looked at her, and then laughed.  \"What right?\"\\r\\nhe asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t that Miss Lennox?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Judge Dyker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I gave him his marriage-license.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policeman\\'s good-nature was amused, but he forced her back to the\\r\\nstreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No use,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' I guess,\" said Mary bitterly--\"I guess I paid for the bride\\'s\\r\\nbouquet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not reply, nor would she have heard him had he spoken, for in\\r\\nthe stream of lesser guests now flowing from the rear of the church,\\r\\nwhich had been assigned to them, she was met by Katie Flanagan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the piquant Katie of that photograph which used to adorn the\\r\\nbureau in the shabby tenement of bachelor Hermann Hoffmann, or the\\r\\nsaucy girl of the second-hand clothing-store, or yet the frightened\\r\\nclerk that had at first evaded and at last defied the whiskered Mr.\\r\\nPorter.  Those days were patently passed; Katie, like many another\\r\\nstrong soul, had faced temptation and conquered it; and in the stead\\r\\nof the old days had come new days that brought a maturity and a\\r\\ndignity with which Katie was consciously satisfied.  Her blue eyes\\r\\nwere as glad as Mary remembered them, but their happiness was calm;\\r\\nher black hair was gathered in a formal knot, and her gown, though a\\r\\nbetter gown than that she used to wear, was of a simplicity almost\\r\\nsevere.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, when she saw Mary, who sought evasion, Katie came\\r\\nfrankly forward with outstretched hand.  She recognized with regret,\\r\\nthe change in her former acquaintance, but, knowing, as she must have\\r\\nknown, its cause, she decided to ask no questions concerning it, and,\\r\\nif she offered no assistance, she at least proffered no advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I just come to see the last o\\' Miss Marian,\" she explained.  \"Near\\r\\nthe half of old Rivington Street\\'s been tucked in here among th\\'\\r\\nswells to give the good word to her--Jews an\\' Irish--an\\' if the\\r\\nrabbis won\\'t mind for the sheenies to come to such a heathen church,\\r\\nI thought Father Kelly might manage to forgive me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s brain was just then too dull to make any but a commonplace\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re lookin\\' well,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ought to be, though there\\'s a youngster expected.  I tell\\r\\nHermann--we was married a few weeks after last election--I don\\'t know\\r\\nhow we\\'ll keep a family; but he just whistles an\\' says we\\'ll make out\\r\\nsome way, an\\' I guess we will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad,\" said Mary, \"that you\\'re married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, so am I--most of the time.  Of course, the man has some queer\\r\\nideas, but I\\'m doin\\' me best, with Father Kelly\\'s help, to get \\'em\\r\\nout of the head of him, an\\' nowadays, when he goes to one of them\\r\\nSocialist meetin\\'s by night, I make him make up by goin\\' with me to\\r\\nearly mass next mornin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused and surveyed again the pale woman before her.  Essentially\\r\\nKatie had not changed.  She had still, and would always have, the\\r\\nbig, kind heart and the ready hand of her earlier days.  But her\\r\\ncondition had altered, and Mary\\'s had evidently again fallen; she\\r\\nlooked through an alien atmosphere, and her gaze was distant: the\\r\\nresponsibilities and adjustment of young married life shackled her,\\r\\nand must continue to shackle her until they were no longer new.  She\\r\\ndid not know how to suggest any assistance, did not even believe that\\r\\nit was desired; but, though she still felt that she must refrain from\\r\\nintimate inquiry, one effort she tried to make.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' you,\" she asked--\"how\\'re you gettin\\' on, Mary?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary bit her lip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fine,\" she answered, huskily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you----?  There ain\\'t----?\"  Katie floundered in a maze that she\\r\\nwould, a few months previously or a few months in the future, have\\r\\ncut her way through with a strong directness.  \"There ain\\'t nothin\\' I\\r\\ncould----?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s head shook, almost mechanically.  It was not entirely that she\\r\\nfelt unable to accept assistance from her former protector; it was\\r\\nrather that she felt only that she must run away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, forcing a smile.  \"I\\'m doin\\' grand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gala crowd was sweeping about them.  It jostled both girls and\\r\\nthreatened momentarily to separate them.  After all, there was\\r\\nnothing more to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I got to go,\" murmured Mary.  \"I got an appointment----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ll come to see us sometime, won\\'t you Mary?\" asked Katie,\\r\\nand she gave her address.  \"We\\'ll have a fine party at the\\r\\nchristening an\\' I\\'ll want you to see the baby.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mary; \"yes, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Katie was hesitant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re sure I can\\'t do nothin\\'?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  I----\"  Mary caught and pressed with what warmth there was\\r\\nleft in her fingers, the Irish girl\\'s hand.  \"Good-by,\" she\\r\\nconcluded, and then, in order to keep up the farce of an appointment,\\r\\nshe got upon a passing car.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if panic had not possessed her, she could not have accepted\\r\\nanything that Katie might offer.  The most that could have been given\\r\\nher would have been but temporary, and what she must have was a means\\r\\nof earning a living.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rode well downtown, and then walked farther southward.  She\\r\\nslipped along the broad, yellow-lighted Bowery, gathering one or two\\r\\nquarters on her way, and wandered into the narrow, serpentine,\\r\\nfevered alleys of Chinatown.  When an ugly rain began to fall, the\\r\\nopen door of a mission attracted her, and she went in to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the typical mission-room, very different from the uptown\\r\\nchurch where she had seen the wedding.  This new place was mean; it\\r\\nhad a low ceiling and was none too clean.  The lights were flaring\\r\\nand the dull walls were enlivened by boldly lettered Bible texts.\\r\\nThe air was close; on the platform, at the front of the place, a\\r\\nwell-fed man was pleading, in sweat and tears, the cause of his\\r\\nreligion; nearby, his double was making ready the reed-organ.\\r\\nCrowded into the unsteady benches were pimpled boys with lolling\\r\\nmouths and preternaturally knowing eyes; youths already old in\\r\\ndisease and drink and crime; full-grown men, frog-eyed or blear-eyed,\\r\\nwho needed only the faculty of firmness and the chance to cultivate\\r\\nit; old men, who had lost their hold upon work in a country still too\\r\\nbarbarous to pension its aged; and, though there were no young girls,\\r\\nhere and there Mary saw a few women, bedraggled, sodden, hideous,\\r\\nbecause men had at some time thought them _chic_, dainty, beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the \"workers\" attached to the place--a bland, prosperous man,\\r\\nwith a pleasant smile--approached Mary and shook her hand as if he\\r\\nwere an old acquaintance.  He had fat red cheeks, firm teeth, and\\r\\nkindly eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad to see you, sister,\" he said.  \"Are you saved?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s childhood had heard some of the phraseology of evangelicalism.\\r\\nShe understood, but she had come to receive worldly, not spiritual,\\r\\nwarmth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she said, \"I ain\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"worker,\" however, was accustomed to that reply.  He patted her\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mary, \"I never thought much about Him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the floor.  She was cold and hungry and afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" responded the man, with genuine earnestness, \"you ought to\\r\\nbegin to think.  No man knoweth the hour of His comin\\'.  He is ready\\r\\nwith the Free Gift.  Don\\'t you want to come to Him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s life had been one in which there had been small time for the\\r\\ncultivation of religious emotion, and no time at all for the\\r\\ncultivation of religious thought.  At her home she had learned as\\r\\nmuch by rote as she had had to learn, but what she got she held only\\r\\nas so many tasks performed.  The words were lessons to be mastered;\\r\\nif they had any relation to facts, those facts were things not to be\\r\\nfaced until an age of discretion, and, pending the arrival of that\\r\\nage, the lessons had been stored away with a bland, childish\\r\\npracticality.  What followed later had driven out all that preceded\\r\\nit.  The shock of her capture; the wild, new order of existence; the\\r\\nendeavor to escape; the battle of service among new conditions; and,\\r\\nat last, the dulling of all the finer sensibilities and the final\\r\\nfight for a mere chance to continue alive--these were circumstances\\r\\nneither propitious to theology nor favorable to faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe glanced at the mission-worker, and then glanced away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dunno,\" she said.  \"I guess I ain\\'t the kind of woman religion can\\r\\ndo much for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t say that,\" protested the man.  His eyes shone with zeal and\\r\\nhis voice was tender.  \"His grace is free for all who come.  His\\r\\nmercy is from everlastin\\' to everlastin\\'.  I\\'ve been a sinner\\r\\nmyself\"--the speaker\\'s voice swelled with a real pride--\"a terrible\\r\\nsinner, an\\' I know what I say, praise the Lord.  The meaner an\\' viler\\r\\nwe are, the more Jesus needs us.  Just open your heart.  Just accept\\r\\nHim, an\\' you\\'ll never know no more trouble in this world nor the\\r\\nnext.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would I get a job?\" asked Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man shook his head, sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That ain\\'t no way to think about salvation,\" he declared.  \"What\\'s\\r\\nfreely given ought to be freely received.  Now is the appointed time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I gotta make a livin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it, I know it.  We\\'ve all got to do that, but ain\\'t it better\\r\\nto make one an\\' be saved than to make one an\\' be sent to hell-fire?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe assented.  \"Only,\" she added, \"I don\\'t want to starve, even if I\\r\\nam saved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was his old difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" he repeated; \"an\\' we\\'d only be too glad to get you work if\\r\\nwe could, but times are hard an\\' we\\'ve got a waitin\\'-list of fifty at\\r\\nthis very minute.  Here\\'s some meal-tickets, sister, fer we want to\\r\\ndo what we can, an\\' we know it\\'s hard to save souls on empty\\r\\nstomachs.  You just think it over an\\' see if I\\'m not right about\\r\\nreligion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the tickets and used them at a five-cent eating-house during\\r\\nthe next day.  That night she managed to secure a bed in a room over\\r\\na saloon--a narrow, stuffy room that she shared with three other\\r\\nwomen of her own sort; but the next night she earned nothing, and she\\r\\nhad been compelled to pawn her coat for food.  She sought a bench in\\r\\nUnion Square, where two tattered men made room for her.  They gave\\r\\nher, to wrap about her chest, newspapers that they had gathered from\\r\\nthe gutter; and she dozed until the sharp command of a policeman\\r\\nscattered her comrades, when they made their way to the rear of the\\r\\nFlatiron Building and stood, for warmth, over a grill that sent up\\r\\noccasional blasts of heat from the basement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapidity with which one may descend from bad to worse is to be\\r\\nbelieved only by those who have been penniless and friendless in the\\r\\nlarger cities.  During the nights that followed, when Mary\\'s clothes\\r\\ngrew speedily ragged, dirty, and odorous, and when she earned just\\r\\nenough money to postpone starvation, she became a familiar of\\r\\nChinatown, learned something of its blind paths and the tangled\\r\\npassages of its fetid tenements.  The almond-eyed Orientals\\r\\ntolerantly received her.  She came to know the heavy odors of the\\r\\nopium, to chat with clay-white American girls, morphine-eaters, and\\r\\ncocaine and chloral victims, whose Chinese lovers were kind to them,\\r\\nand who never wanted to breathe the open air.  She was borne with,\\r\\nbut the market was over-supplied there, and she found no regular\\r\\nkeeper.  She came to envy the drug-enslaved women who had first\\r\\nsought the Mott Street district as missionaries, even the little\\r\\nMongolian girls over whose slavery, so much lighter than her own, the\\r\\ncity, from time to time, grew ludicrously excited.  Her illness\\r\\nprogressed, but, thanks to her hardy birth and the exercise of what\\r\\ncare was at all possible, it progressed with a step so tardy as to\\r\\ngive no indication of reaching its tragic end, other things being\\r\\nequal, for two years or more.  She did not again go to see the\\r\\ndoctor; she did not have to.  The only things that he could have\\r\\nadvised were the things that she was in no position to do.  Beyond a\\r\\ncertain limited amount of routine care, she was helpless.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, wet and exhausted, she met a sailor in Chatham Square, and\\r\\ndrank long with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where you goin\\' to sleep to-night?\" he asked, as they were about to\\r\\npart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a short, black-browed man, who walked with a bow-legged roll.\\r\\nThe short sleeves of his jacket displayed sinewy, bronze wrists with\\r\\nanchors tattooed upon them.  His neck rose out of his low-cut\\r\\nmariner\\'s shirt like the neck of a brown, fighting bull, and his\\r\\nblack eyes, set deep under bushy, frowning brows, were red, like\\r\\nthose of a bull that is dangerous.  He had been taken with a drunken\\r\\npassion for her, and though, when he kissed her, his upper lip\\r\\nscraped her face like a file, though his incessant grip of her hands\\r\\nhurt her, and though his heavy foot, seeking hers beneath the\\r\\nsaloon-table, nearly crushed her own, she had to answer him with the\\r\\nprofessional smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dunno where I\\'ll sleep,\" she said.  \"I guess Lee Hung\\'s Letty\\'ll\\r\\nput me up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailor chucked her pointed chin so roughly that she thought her\\r\\nneck would crack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you come along o\\' me?\" he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To one o\\' our places.  I know a beauty, an\\' I\\'ll take good care o\\'\\r\\nyou, an\\' afterward you can stay on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of your places?  What\\'s those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Places we visit.  Places for seafarin\\' men.  I tells you I knows a\\r\\ndaisy--Big Lou\\'s keepin\\' it--an\\' they needs a new gal there, for I\\r\\nstopped in as I come ashore this evenin\\' an\\' they tole me the one I\\r\\nknew after last voyage was buried only yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it all right?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right?  Course it\\'s all right.  But mind you,\"--his black eyes\\r\\nleaped into a sudden threat--\"I\\'m takin\\' you to-night.  No\\r\\nphilanderin\\'.  For this night y\\'er my gal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind you that,\" he drunkenly repeated.  \"I\\'m mostly as gentle as\\r\\nNathan\\'s lamb, but when I\\'m tricked I\\'m ready with my hands.  It\\'s\\r\\nall right.  It\\'s a good place for a good time.  Plenty to drink an\\'\\r\\nthe best o\\' company.  Better come.  I can fix it so\\'s you can get a\\r\\nsteady job there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shivered again, but she could not see why she should shiver.\\r\\nAfter all, she was glad to learn of any place where she would be sure\\r\\nof food to eat and a roof to cover her--and so she came to\\r\\nSummerton\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DOORS OF THE SHADOW\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a winding and tortuous way across Greenwich Village to\\r\\nSummerton\\'s.  The mazed course runs through streets that squirm like\\r\\nworms between a fisherman\\'s fingers; it skirts cobbled courts that\\r\\nare in twilight at midday and damp in the longest drought; it turns\\r\\nand doubles up passages that seem blind, dodges through the very\\r\\nbones of tumble-down warehouses, storehouses, houses so ramshackle\\r\\nthat the imagination can conjure no possible use for them, and it\\r\\ncomes out at last into a foul thoroughfare that appears to be no\\r\\nbetter than a stinking alley, so close to the water\\'s edge that the\\r\\nmasts of the river\\'s cluttered craft look as if they grew upon the\\r\\ndirty, sagging roofs opposite, and so near to the wharves that the\\r\\ngreen walls of the buildings are wet and odorous as if from a\\r\\ncontinuous application of bilge-water.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy day, when its residents are asleep, this street is loud with\\r\\nstraining Norman horses, and clattering vans, and whip-cracking\\r\\ncarters from the docks; but by night--and the nights are very dark\\r\\ndown there--it becomes the haunt of sailors and longshoremen, drunk\\r\\nand shouting, or still and drugged.  Then the blue electric lamps\\r\\nsnap hysterically at distant corners; the uneven pavement mounts\\r\\nsteeply upward, or dashes precipitately downward, with no warning;\\r\\nlaughter and curses and the crash of breaking glass or spluttering\\r\\noaths issue now and again from the blackness at one\\'s elbow, where,\\r\\nhidden among the warehouses, stand the houses for the storing of\\r\\nanother sort of wares: the slave-houses maintained for mariners.\\r\\nGrotesque men, could you see them, stagger into dim entrances;\\r\\nterrible caricatures of women, if the light would show them, steal\\r\\nout and dart upon gutter-couched drunkards to paw their pockets.  The\\r\\nnight is alive with shadows, and the whole street a hungry, quivering\\r\\nquicksand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly by urging her eyes to their utmost could Mary make out anything\\r\\nof the house before which she and her unsteady companion came to\\r\\npause.  Even then all of which she could be sure was that, cowering\\r\\nunder the shadow of some huge brick building, and skulking beneath\\r\\nits own rotting eaves, it was a half-sunken, old, narrow house, long\\r\\nsince abandoned as unfit for legitimate purposes, and leaning\\r\\nrakishly to one side, like an ancient libertine that knows his evil\\r\\nand grins at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailor knocked lightly at an almost unseen door.  A panel of it\\r\\nslid open and threw a ray of light on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" asked a voice that was like the rasping of a file.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s Billy,\" said the sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billy who?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Billy Stevens.  Le\\'me in, Lou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA pair of swollen eyes came to the open panel and looked, down the\\r\\nshaft of light, into the sinister face of Bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s that with you?\" croaked the voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A gal I got for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is she all right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O\\' course she is, Lou; else what in hell\\'d she be doin\\' with me?\\r\\nCome on; le\\'me in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swollen eyes disappeared, and the panel was shut.  There was a\\r\\nsound of the withdrawal of several bolts.  Then the door swung open,\\r\\nwas closed and relocked behind the newcomers, and Mary found herself\\r\\nin an unfurnished hall, not more than fifteen feet square, lighted by\\r\\na dim lamp standing on the lowest step of a steep flight of stairs,\\r\\nand guarded by the owner of the swollen eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least in height, \"Big Lou\" was gigantic.  She was fully six feet\\r\\ntall; she stooped a little and was extremely thin, with a hollow\\r\\nchest and narrow flanks, partially hidden by an old red cotton\\r\\ndressing-gown; but the long arms were like flails, and Lou had a\\r\\ntemper that did not hesitate to use them as such.  Her dirty brown\\r\\nhair was already touched with gray; she had almost no chin; her nose\\r\\nwas a smudge in her sodden face and her cheeks were heavy with years\\r\\nof drunkenness.  Her mouth hung loose and quarrelsome, and, as she\\r\\nbent over to look hard at Mary, her breath was foul.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe addressed herself, however, entirely to the black-browed Stevens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'d you git her?\" she asked, as if Mary were one of the animals\\r\\nnot gifted with articulate speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens told of their meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s she from?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailor gave a rapid and wholly fictitious biography.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty,\" said Bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t!\" protested Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the sailor shot her an ugly look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Close your trap,\" he told her, and then, to Big Lou, he repeated:\\r\\n\"Twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Lou picked up the lamp and, holding it in one blackened claw,\\r\\npassed the other over Mary, with dexterous appraisement, from\\r\\nshoulders to knees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll give you a five-spot for her,\" she croaked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll go to the devil,\" retorted Bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Six?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a damned thief, Stevens, that\\'s what you are,\" growled the\\r\\nold woman.  \"I\\'ll give you seven, an\\' not another God damned cent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary leaned against the moist wall.  She was now past caring, and she\\r\\nhardly heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make it seven-seventy-five,\" said Bill, with sudden ingratiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Lou raised the lamp again and again regarded the animal, her\\r\\nswollen eyes sharpening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do,\" she said, once more facing the sailor.\\r\\n\"Are you goin\\' to stop here to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll come up in the mornin\\' and take a closer look.  If she\\r\\npasses that, I\\'ll give you seven-fifty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBill\\'s brown face worked in thought, but the thirst for liquor was\\r\\nupon him, and he compromised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said--\"if you\\'ll give me five down on account.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giantess flung aside her red dressing-gown and, from a black\\r\\ncotton stocking that hung loose upon a shriveled shank, drew a few\\r\\ngreasy bills.  From these she reluctantly counted five, handed them\\r\\nto Stevens, and returned the rest to their original place of safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"G\\'on up,\" she said.  \"I stay here till work\\'s done, an\\' take tolls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom somewhere in the shadows she produced a black flask and, as\\r\\nMary, with the sailor\\'s tattooed hand tightly under her arm, began\\r\\nthe steep ascent, Big Lou settled herself at her post of gatekeeper\\r\\nupon the lowest step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose stairs seemed almost perpendicular.  They rose out of the\\r\\ndarkness of the hallway at an alarming angle; each step was close\\r\\nupon a foot high; they were not a yard wide, their upper half was\\r\\nboxed between two walls, and they opened directly into the room that\\r\\nevidently served as the parlor of Big Lou Summerton\\'s establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was small and badly lighted by a kerosene hand-lamp, which\\r\\nstood upon a circular center-table and sent up a thin column of smoke\\r\\nto the sooty ceiling.  A spotted lounge with dilapidated springs\\r\\nstood in one corner; the faded paper was peeling from the plaster,\\r\\nand a broken stove, which glowed an angry red, heated the place to a\\r\\ndegree that was well-nigh unbearable.  The air was stale and rancid,\\r\\nboth from the company that was present and from a long entertainment\\r\\nof similar companies, in days gone by.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were only two persons in the room.  Both were seated at the\\r\\ntable, both were drinking whiskey poured into ragged-edged glasses\\r\\nfrom a bottle that stood between them, and both were, or had been,\\r\\nwomen.  Of these one coughed so sharply and constantly between her\\r\\ntoothless gums, and was so shrunken under her blue calico\\r\\nmother-hubbard, that it was plain she would soon be nothing; while\\r\\nthe other was a creature with face red and bloated, features stunted\\r\\nand coarse, eyes that glowed dully, and the voice of a crow.\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens presented Mary to them, and wasted no formalities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This here\\'s a new one,\" he said, and, motioning his charge to a\\r\\nthird chair, himself pulled up a fourth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two inmates received her with a loud duet that was almost a\\r\\nchoral jeer.  Two more glasses were produced from a shadowy cupboard,\\r\\nand the drinking recommenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took one long drink and, wasted by privation, passed at once for\\r\\nsome time into a daze in which, though she saw all, she reckoned\\r\\nlittle.  She heard Stevens drop into the babbling stage of\\r\\ndrunkenness; she noted that, though the women kept pace with his\\r\\npotations, they poured water into their own whiskey and gin into the\\r\\nsailor\\'s; she saw him loll in his chair and sway over the table; she\\r\\nfelt his heavy head drop at last on her thin shoulder, and she did\\r\\nnot move while, as he lay there, his companions--now hers--went\\r\\nthrough his clothes and tiptoed out of a rear door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then that, with a quick start, she regained control of herself\\r\\nat the sound of speech below and the tread of feet on the stairs.  A\\r\\nrough voice had assured Big Lou that \"it was all right,\" and another\\r\\nvoice was supplementing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rest easy, my dear lady: we are paying as we go.  Michael, here, is,\\r\\nas you know, a deck-hand on the admirable yacht of my admirable\\r\\nfriend Marsden Payne, with whom I have been on a winter excursion;\\r\\nand he has kindly consented to show me his own section of little old\\r\\nNew York.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary knew that voice, although she could not at once identify it;\\r\\nbut, though she sprang up so quickly that she wakened the tumbling\\r\\nStevens, who slipped to the floor, she could not escape before she\\r\\nfound herself directly regarding the flushed face, glowing gray eyes,\\r\\nand disordered hair of Philip Beekman.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill young and slim in his yachting clothes, he looked at her,\\r\\nswaying a little in the doorway, his back to those perilous stairs,\\r\\nand with no clear recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" he said.  \"I think I\\'ve had the pleasure of meeting you\\r\\nsomewhere before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s mouth tightened.  She had herself now well in hand.  She shook\\r\\nher russet head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess not,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her voice betrayed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord!\" said Beekman.  The flush deepened on his face.  With one\\r\\nhand he snatched his yachting-cap from his black hair; the other he\\r\\nsuddenly held out to her, trembling.  \"Good Lord!\" he repeated, this\\r\\ntime with something that was nearly awe in his tone.  \"I--I--it\\'s\\r\\n_Violet_!  Will you----?  Won\\'t you _please_ shake hands?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely less amazed by his manner than was he by her appearance, she\\r\\ntook his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman turned to someone on the stairs behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get out, Mike!\" he said.  \"I\\'ve found a friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a plucking at his sleeve and the murmur of a concerned\\r\\nvoice from the rear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Philip; \"get out.  I tell you that I have found a friend.\\r\\nGo down to the tall lady and hand her your money and then make tracks\\r\\nfor the yacht.  You may tell Mr. Payne that I shall return in an\\r\\nhour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a muffled protest from the dangerous stairway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me a moment,\" said Beekman, and turned full around.  \"Now,\\r\\nthen,\" he continued to his guide, \"you get out.  I am perfectly well\\r\\nable to take care of myself, and I want a private talk.  Do you\\r\\nexpect me to kick you downstairs?  No?  I should probably break your\\r\\nback if I did.--Then, good-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood there while the deckhand\\'s heavy feet clattered downward;\\r\\nwaited until he had heard Big Lou grumblingly give Mike the means of\\r\\nexit, and then he turned again to Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What,\" he rapidly began, and his handsome face grew once more\\r\\nearnest, \"what in the name of heaven are you doing in this den?--No,\"\\r\\nhe continued, raising a quick hand; \"don\\'t tell me; I remember how I\\r\\nsent you out of my mother\\'s house and, upon my word, I\\'m afraid to\\r\\nhear.  I couldn\\'t do anything else--but I don\\'t know.  Anyhow,\\r\\nthere\\'s one thing sure: you need money.  Well, I made a little in the\\r\\ngame to-night--not much for Payne, but a good slice for me--and it\\'s\\r\\nyours--it\\'s yours--the Lord knows it ought to go to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had tried to stop him until he spoke of money; but when he\\r\\nmentioned that, she let him run on, let him search his pockets, and\\r\\nat last let him thrust something into her open hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" he said; \"take it; take it as a favor to me; take it, and\\r\\nremember what I said to you in Rose\\'s.  Watch your chance; get out of\\r\\nhere; and for God\\'s sake go back to your own home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fingers closed upon the bills and transferred them to her\\r\\nstocking; and as she did this a movement on the floor made them both\\r\\nturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Stevens, whom Mary had forgotten and whom Beekman had not seen,\\r\\ngathered himself together, and at last stood more or less upright\\r\\nupon his unsteady bowed legs.  His heavy body rocked uneasily, but\\r\\nhis dark face, with its bushy brows and sinister eyes, was thrust\\r\\nforward glowering.  One sinewy tattooed hand gripped the back of a\\r\\nchair; the other, knotted into a hard fist, he raised slowly toward\\r\\nBeekman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s your turn to go,\" he said, with a lingering oath.  \"This here\\'s\\r\\nmy gal; she b\\'longs to me--an\\' so does any money she gits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly Philip was his old, assured self.  That quality which was\\r\\nmost characteristic of him, that curious mixture of much that was\\r\\nbitter and a little that was sweet, lighted his eyes and rang in his\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where do _you_ come from?\" he asked, smiling.  \"You look as if you\\r\\ngot out of a trap-door, like the fairy in the play.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None o\\' your business where I come from,\" said Bill.  \"The point is\\r\\nwhere I\\'ll send you, if you ain\\'t careful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, who did not like the looks of things, tried to interpose.  She\\r\\nput the palms of her hands against the sailor\\'s rough cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen, Bill,\" she said, \"this is an old friend of mine----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Likely!\" grunted Bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, though; ain\\'t you?\" Mary appealed, with a sidelong glance at\\r\\nBeekman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly I am,\" said Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens lowered his fist, but his red eyes remained full of hate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care who you are,\" he rumbled; \"this here\\'s my woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Beekman; \"that\\'s to your credit, I\\'m sure: a man is\\r\\nknown by the woman he keeps, and you can\\'t have a better.  Only, you\\r\\nsee, my friend----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t yer friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more Mary interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just sit down, Bill,\" she urged.  \"Sit down an\\' have a drink with\\r\\nus.  You can hear all we got to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens sank into a chair, but when Beekman, with Mary between them,\\r\\npushed the bottle toward Bill, the sailor would have none of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll stop a bit,\" he said, \"but I ain\\'t goin\\' to drink with you, an\\'\\r\\nyou needn\\'t think it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip was still undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have it your own way,\" he said.  \"I know how it is: when a man falls\\r\\nin love, he swears off liquor; when he falls out of love he takes to\\r\\nliquor again--one sort of drunkenness is as much as he can stand at a\\r\\ntime.  I\\'ll take a drink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, who now began to fear acute trouble, slipped a hand to Stevens,\\r\\nbut he drew away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I\\'ll smoke--if I may,\" continued the undisturbed Beekman.\\r\\n\"A pipe is domestic, a cigar is philosophic, and a cigarette is a\\r\\ncynic: I shall have a cigarette.  William?\"--And he offered his\\r\\nsilver case to the sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Stevens, shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman tossed his head.  Mary saw his gray eyes snap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"William,\" he said, \"you have got to learn that the best girl is\\r\\nnever so good as the next.  And you have got to learn manners.  If\\r\\nyou won\\'t behave yourself properly, I think you had better leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens\\'s fingers opened and closed slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You go to hell,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeekman rose quietly.  His cigarette was in one hand, and with the\\r\\nother, instead of threatening, he pointed to the stairway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run along,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens jumped to his feet and crouched, like a panther ready to\\r\\nspring.  Mary, overturning her chair, flung her arms about him and\\r\\npinioned him in an embrace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t, Bill!\" she whispered, and, over her shoulder: \"Don\\'t, Mr.\\r\\nBeekman!  Can\\'t you two be friends?  Can\\'t you see it\\'s all right,\\r\\nBill?  Can\\'t you let him alone, Mr. Beekman?  Bill, you know how much\\r\\nI think of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her lips to his rough face.  She whispered rapid, unthought\\r\\nlies into his ear.  She caressed and cajoled him, and at last, when\\r\\nPhilip had been persuaded into a half-scornful apology, she managed\\r\\nto get Stevens out of the room and started him down the stairway to\\r\\nseek sympathy of Big Lou while she herself had her talk with Beekman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down again at the round table and took a drink.  Philip\\r\\nwanted to upbraid himself for his conduct to her in his mother\\'s\\r\\nhouse, and yet, because he felt that he could have followed no course\\r\\nsave that which he had taken, he did not know how to begin: all that\\r\\nhe was sure of was that there was a wrong somewhere, and that he must\\r\\nsomehow make confession of it.  Mary, on the other hand, was divided\\r\\nbetween panic from the trouble so lately avoided and a desire to hear\\r\\nfrom Philip nothing approaching condolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sought escape in the commonplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mustn\\'t mind him,\" she said, with a nod toward the stairs down\\r\\nwhich the glowering Bill had departed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bit,\" answered Beekman.  \"I only wanted to get rid of him in\\r\\norder to tell you hew sorry I am for--for--oh, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk about that, Mr. Beekman--please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I must talk about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not now; not yet.  Tell me how you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'m as near right as I ever am, or ever will be.  But,\\r\\nViolet----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re looking rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes followed hers to his gilt-buttoned yachting jacket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can never judge a man by his clothes,\" he said.  \"Necessity is\\r\\nthe mother of pretension.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you married yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardly.  There are only two things that a man can\\'t honestly\\r\\npromise: to love, and to cease to love.  I\\'m still too poor to afford\\r\\nthose lies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary only half understood his mood, but she was wholly intent on\\r\\nkeeping him free of dreaded topics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you hear anything of the people we used to know?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Philip, \"Rose was let off, you know, and is back at the\\r\\nold address and the old business.\"  He looked at his watch and\\r\\nstarted.  \"By Jove,\" he continued; \"I must have been pretty tight.  I\\r\\nhad no idea it was so late.  I\\'ve got to be getting back to the yacht\\r\\nsoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood up, his cap in one hand.  Mary followed him to the stair\\r\\ndoor, and there he turned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Violet,\" he said, \"I am going to tell you how sorry I am.  I am\\r\\ngoing to tell you, whether you like to hear it or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flush had gone from his face and eyes, leaving them simple and\\r\\nsincere.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s voice faltered.  She understood some things that she had never\\r\\nbefore understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It didn\\'t matter none,\" she replied.  \"You couldn\\'t help it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I daresay I couldn\\'t.  I don\\'t know.  These things are too much for\\r\\nme.  But I do know that I am sorry--sorry from the bottom of my\\r\\nheart.  And if I can ever do anything--anything----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put out his hand, and, as she took it, he raised her hand to his\\r\\nlips.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant there was a yell of rage from behind him.  Mary,\\r\\nspringing back, saw him half turn and reel.  She saw a brown,\\r\\ntattooed hand close about his throat, choking his cry of alarm.  She\\r\\nsaw Bill Stevens\\'s distorted face and red eyes appear above Beekman\\'s\\r\\nshoulder.  She saw a knife flash and bury itself deep in the young\\r\\nman\\'s side.  And then, with a tremendous smash, both men disappeared\\r\\ndown those murderous, black stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to Mary that she lost not a moment in running down to them;\\r\\nyet, when she reached the hall, the little drama was finished.  The\\r\\nsailor was lying stunned in a corner, and Big Lou, with the rescued\\r\\nlamp beside her, was kneeling above Philip\\'s body and running her\\r\\nquick claws through his pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damn your soul, get upstairs!\" she cried to Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary hesitated.  Overhead she heard the skurry of skirts and\\r\\nhurried feet.  Before her lay the man that had once so harmed her.\\r\\nHis coat had been torn open and a great red smear grew larger and\\r\\nlarger upon his white silk shirt.  His mouth was twisted, but still.\\r\\nHis gray eyes stared at the begrimed ceiling: Philip Beekman was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaped across the body, tore back the bolts, flung open the door,\\r\\nand nearly fell into the pitch-black street.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she ran around the nearest corner, she heard the cry of Mike, the\\r\\ndeckhand, who must have been waiting nearby, and then the sharp\\r\\nalarm-call of a policeman\\'s night-stick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXX\\r\\n\\r\\nHER FATHER\\'S HOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\nHer way must have led her first to the river and then well northward:\\r\\nshe did not know.  She did not even know whether she ran or walked.\\r\\nAll that she did know was that, at least for hours to come, she must\\r\\nput as many miles as she could between her own tossing thoughts and\\r\\nthat still face with the staring eyes which lay at the foot of the\\r\\nsteep, dark stairs in Summerton\\'s.  The clocks, had she looked at\\r\\nthem, would have told her that the night was gone, but the winter\\r\\ndarkness still enveloped the city when she found herself at last\\r\\nstanding before an illuminated ticket-window and addressing a sleepy\\r\\nclerk at a ferry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want a ticket,\" she said, and laid down one of the bills that\\r\\nPhilip Beekman had given her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where to?\" yawned the clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did it happen that the name which rose to her lips was the name\\r\\nof her native town--a word that she had not uttered since the morning\\r\\nof her awakening in the house of Rose Légère?  Perhaps it was because\\r\\nthe dead man had, with almost his last words, pleaded with her to go\\r\\nhome; perhaps it was because that name, of which she had for so long\\r\\ntried never to think, was, in reality, the one always nearest to her\\r\\nheart; perhaps it was only because no other town was familiar to her.\\r\\nIn any event, the name was spoken without consideration of the\\r\\nconsequences, and, before she had time to pause or to repent, the\\r\\nclerk had handed her the change, and with it the bit of pasteboard\\r\\nthat would bear her home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a boat in ten minutes,\" he said: \"but you\\'ll have to wait an\\r\\nhour in Jersey City.  The first train doesn\\'t go till six-five.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf what immediately followed she had, thereafter, no clear\\r\\nrecollection.  She remembered only buying a cold sandwich and a\\r\\nhalf-pint of whiskey in a deserted café; crossing a bitterly cold,\\r\\nsullen stretch of water from a twinkling cañon to a shadowy shore;\\r\\nwalking, for warmth, weary though she was, up and down, and up and\\r\\ndown, along a damp, echoing train-shed, and then, at last, passing a\\r\\nclanging iron gate, climbing into a coach, and falling, nearly\\r\\nstupefied, into an uncomfortable, red-plush covered seat.  She had\\r\\nbut the faintest mental picture of changing cars, and none at all of\\r\\nany subsequent incident, until, in a black dawn, there flashed upon\\r\\nher, from between the frost-figures on the window, a bit of landscape\\r\\nthat warned her she was approaching home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe track came suddenly to the river-side.  Beneath a gray sky,\\r\\nwhich, though the morning was well advanced, the sun seemed afraid to\\r\\nclimb, there raced the mile-and-a-half wide strip of gray water.  It\\r\\ncrashed across a ruined dam; it swept above a submerged \"chute\"\\r\\nthrough which, years before, the big pine-rafts from the upper\\r\\nAlleghanies used to be hurled on their way to the Chesapeake.  There\\r\\nhad been a thaw: only here and there could Mary see the ominous\\r\\ncrests of the rocks that threatened the mid-channel; the islands,\\r\\nwith trees bare of foliage, were under water, and far away, from the\\r\\ncloudy York County shore, the high hills rose above the mist, dun and\\r\\ncheerless, forbidding and cold.  With a quick catch in her throat,\\r\\nshe saw the river-road that she had so often tramped on holidays, now\\r\\naxle-deep in mud.  Over there were the leafless woods where, when the\\r\\nboughs were green, the children used to picnic, and here, nearer the\\r\\ntown, where patches of soiled snow hid under the stunted pines, was\\r\\nthe path where one time came, for pink laurel branches, a girl that\\r\\nshe had been.  The engine whistled sharply and stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary mechanically readjusted the hat that she had not touched since\\r\\nshe had put it on for the work of the evening previous--the evening\\r\\nso long ago.  She stepped to the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station was just as it had always been.  It looked smaller and\\r\\ndirtier, but she knew that it had not changed; and a sharp pain shot\\r\\nthrough her heart at the realization that, in this town, everything\\r\\nhad gone on its placid way while so much had been happening to one of\\r\\nits children.  There were the same grinning gamins waiting for the\\r\\nNew York newspapers; the same negro porters from the two hotels; the\\r\\nsame station-master \"calling the train,\" just as he used to call it\\r\\nin the days when she had watched the outgoing coaches with envious\\r\\nlongings for a sight of the strange lands toward which they were\\r\\nbound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as her aching feet touched the cinder of the thoroughfare, she\\r\\nrealized her danger.  She had no plan, no scheme of accounting for\\r\\nherself; some unreasoned impulse, partly, doubtless, the primal\\r\\ninstinct that drives the wounded beast to its den, had overcome her\\r\\nfears and turned her face in the direction of the home whither she\\r\\nhad, for so long, dreaded to return.  But now she was seized with a\\r\\nterror of recognition by the townspeople, and so she lowered her head\\r\\nand walked, with the swiftness of panic, among the little knot of\\r\\nloafers about the station-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that she was here, what was she to say, what to do, where to\\r\\nturn?  She moved, unable to evolve any order from the chaos of her\\r\\nthoughts.  She could only go over and over the memory of that last\\r\\nday in school; the early violets, purple and fragrant, peeping\\r\\nthrough the lush grass on the lawns of Second Street; the flaming\\r\\noriole in the Southwark yard; the lazy sunlight flowing through the\\r\\nopen windows of Miss England\\'s sleepy classroom.  Mary\\'s blue eyes\\r\\nwere bright then, her mouth was red, her cheeks pink; lithe,\\r\\nstrong-limbed, and firm of body, her walk had owned the easy, languid\\r\\ngrace of a wild animal.  And now, the lawns were bare; only a few\\r\\npersistent sparrows hopped in the gutters and along the ground; the\\r\\nsky was empty of sunlight, and she----\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came to a supreme pause.  Habit had led her aimless feet.  She\\r\\nwas standing, in the full morning, before the two-story brick house\\r\\nthat was her father\\'s home.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew that the door remained unlocked from dawn to night; but she\\r\\ndid not at once enter.  She was afraid to go in, afraid to stand\\r\\nstill, afraid to go away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, from the next house, came decision.  It was Etta\\'s, her married\\r\\nsister\\'s place, and she heard someone within it rattle at its door.\\r\\nAnything was better than a meeting with Etta: Mary quietly opened the\\r\\ndoor to her father\\'s house and slipped inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went down the brief, darkened hallway, past the drawn curtains of\\r\\nthe parlor, through the twilight of the dining-room, and stopped at\\r\\nthe open entrance to the small, crowded kitchen, where, among neatly\\r\\narranged and brightly polished pots and pans, her mother was bending\\r\\nover the glowing stove.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh looked up with a start.  Still stooped, still\\r\\nhatchet-faced, but grayer and more shrunken, she stood there, her\\r\\nsleeves rolled from her thin forearms, her forehead wet by present\\r\\nlabor, her mouth set hard by labors gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get out o\\' here!\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mom!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary raised and spread her arms in quick petitioning, and then, in\\r\\nthat stranger, Mrs. Denbigh recognized her child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_You?_\" she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe dashed her damp hands to her checkered apron; she stepped toward\\r\\nher daughter with her own arms wide.  She bent to kiss her--and she\\r\\ndrew as suddenly away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s liquor on your breath!\" she gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Mary, her voice low and trembling.  \"I--I ain\\'t been\\r\\nwell, mom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kiss was given, but less abandonedly than it had promised, and,\\r\\nas the mother drew away, her keen eyes searched the girl from face to\\r\\nfeet.  Over the multitude of maternal questions there rose the three\\r\\nfor which Mary was least prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary--what is it?  Where is he?  Didn\\'t he treat you right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey caught the girl at her weakest point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?\"--Mrs. Denbigh\\'s eyes grew stern again.--\"Who?  You needn\\'t say\\r\\nno more than that still!  I ought to have knowed when I seen you.\\r\\nNobody could look at you yet and not know.  Why, you\\'re--you\\'re\\r\\n_old_!  Your things are worn out.  You----\" her tone increased to\\r\\nloud accusations.  \"Where did you get them clothes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s lips faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bought \\'em,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did anybody see you come in here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know.--No, nobody did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank God for that!\"  Mrs. Denbigh pointed a long, gnarled finger at\\r\\nher daughter.  She pointed it at the bedraggled hat, still bearing\\r\\ntraces of a finery too pronounced for that small town.  She pointed\\r\\nto the waist and to the skirt.  \"It\\'s true, then!\" she cried.  \"It\\'s\\r\\ntrue, then!  You\\'ve been a bad woman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the doorway Mary swayed.  She leaned heavily against the wall.\\r\\nShe was too tired to lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" her mother echoed; \"yes--an\\' you own up to it!  The whole town\\r\\nsaid it; your pop said it; they all told me yet--an\\' I stood up fer\\r\\nyou; I showed \\'em your letter; I says you was married; I kep\\' on\\r\\nbelievin\\' you\\'d write; I stuck to it--an\\' now you come here to shame\\r\\nme.  You come here when you\\'re worn out--when no one else\\'ll have\\r\\nyou--you come here, brazen, not carin\\' still, a bad woman--_a bad\\r\\nwoman_--an\\' I guess you think I\\'ll take you in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer poor face writhed.  Her dim eyes shot fire.  Her withered breasts\\r\\nrose and fell in a spasm of indignation and wounded pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, still leaning against the kitchen wall, put out her hands as if\\r\\nto ward away a blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t, mom,\" she said.  \"Please don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will!  I\\'ve a mind to beat you.  I\\'d like to know what possessed\\r\\nyou to flaunt yourself in this place.  You can\\'t stay here.  You\\r\\ncan\\'t stay in this house that you\\'ve shamed still, an\\' you can\\'t stay\\r\\nin this town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mom!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t stay in this town.  Do you hear that?  If you do, if you\\r\\ntry to stay here and mock me, a decent woman, I\\'ll have you arrested;\\r\\nI\\'ll have you sent to the lock-up; I\\'ll----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mom,\" interrupted Mary.  \"I won\\'t hurt you.  I didn\\'t mean to hurt\\r\\nnobody.  I didn\\'t come here to do no harm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How kin you come here yet without doin\\' harm?  Ain\\'t you done enough\\r\\nwithout comin\\' back here to shame your own folks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, mom,\" Mary pleaded, \"I won\\'t shame nobody; I\\'ll do whatever you\\r\\nsay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Mrs. Denbigh collapsed upon a kitchen chair.  She rocked from\\r\\nside to side.  She fanned herself with her checkered apron; grief\\r\\nconquered anger; and long dried tears came at last to her old eyes\\r\\nand coursed, unrestrained, down her hard cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did I ever do fer to deserve this?\" she moaned.  \"What did I\\r\\never do to receive this judgment?  A child o\\' mine!  A child o\\' mine!\\r\\nAn\\' her the baby that she was!  Didn\\'t her pop an\\' me bring her up\\r\\nthe best we could?  Ain\\'t I always lived accordin\\' to the Lord\\'s\\r\\nword?  What have I done to deserve this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary stepped to the weeping woman\\'s side.  She put her fingers to the\\r\\ngray hair and stroked it, timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go away!\" cried the mother.  \"Don\\'t you dare to touch me!  Don\\'t you\\r\\ndare yet to pollute me!  Oh!  A child o\\' mine to do this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fell into another paroxysm of grief, and Mary sank to her knees\\r\\nand took one of the gnarled hands between her own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen, mom,\" she said; \"I\\'ll tell you all about it, an\\' then you\\'ll\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did tell her, as much as she dared; but Mrs. Denbigh only half\\r\\nunderstood.  The elder woman\\'s life had been cast in a mold; it had\\r\\nlong since hardened into a destined shape, and no sympathy on her own\\r\\npart, no explanations on the part of another, could alter her.  Dire\\r\\nnecessity she had often known, but she had not known it amid\\r\\nsurroundings where the sufferer\\'s only course was that which alone\\r\\nhad been possible for Mary.  If she softened, it was not because she\\r\\ncomprehended, but because Mary was her child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t tell me no more,\" she said at last.  \"You could \\'a\\' gone to\\r\\nwork.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tried that, an\\' nobody\\'d have me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could \\'a\\' gone to some church-folk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did, but they couldn\\'t get me a job.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could \\'a\\' gone to some institution a\\'ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How\\'d I have lived after I come out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you shouldn\\'t \\'a\\' run away in the first place.  Didn\\'t we\\r\\ntreat you right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo have answered that question in the negative would not have been to\\r\\nbe altogether true, and Mary did not even yet see enough clearly to\\r\\ndiscern that the conditions which had driven her from home were\\r\\neconomic forces that made parents and child equally blameless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t I stay here?\" she appealed.  \"Can\\'t I please stay here an\\'\\r\\nwork for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d work hard.  I\\'d help you.  I wouldn\\'t never complain.  All I\\r\\nwant is just to be quiet.  I\\'d work hard.  Nobody\\'d never know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'d be all over town by evenin\\' still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it wouldn\\'t.  I\\'d say I was a widow.  I\\'d say----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think o\\' your pop,\" sobbed Mrs. Denbigh.  \"Why, he\\'d--he\\'d kill you,\\r\\nMary!\"  The mother shivered as she considered the wrath of the giant,\\r\\nwhom hard work had hardened past the touch of all the tenderer\\r\\nemotions.  \"He\\'d just beat you up an\\' throw you into the street for\\r\\neverybody to see!\"  She half rose in a new anxiety.  \"Why, he\\'s on\\r\\nthe early shift, an\\' he might come here \\'most any minute.  Etta might\\r\\ncome in, an\\' Sallie\\'ll be back from school soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, mom,\" Mary blindly persisted.  \"I\\'d work so hard!  I wouldn\\'t\\r\\nnever be cross.  I\\'d help you.  I\\'d do all the housework, an\\' you\\r\\ncould teach me to cook the way you do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We got to think o\\' Sallie yet,\" continued Mrs. Denbigh.  \"Every time\\r\\nshe gets mad now she says she\\'ll run away like you done.  We got to\\r\\nthink o\\' her.  She\\'s a growin\\' girl, an\\' what\\'d it be to have you\\r\\naround her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, mom, I won\\'t hurt her.  Can\\'t I just stay an\\' work, an\\' wash\\r\\ndishes, an\\' such things?  I wouldn\\'t mind washin\\' dishes\"--Mary\\r\\nsmiled wanly--\"like I once did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' then there\\'s Etta,\" said the mother, still busied in her own\\r\\nconfusion.  \"She\\'s got a baby----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A baby!\"  Mary\\'s heart leaped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such a lovely baby girl----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t I----?  Oh, mom, can\\'t I just get a peep at it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could you?--An\\' we have to think what it\\'d be for her if you was\\r\\nhere an\\' she growed up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prodigal choked with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mom, mom!\" she pleaded.  \"How\\'d I hurt \\'em?  You don\\'t think\\r\\nI\\'d----?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The town\\'d think so, an\\' the town\\'d tell \\'em so, too.  An\\' anyways,\\r\\nMary, we\\'re poor, we\\'re dreadful poor.  The mill was shut down all\\r\\nsummer an\\' fall.  It\\'s only just started a\\'ready, an\\' it\\'s only\\r\\nworkin\\' half-time now.  We ain\\'t had money fer months still, an\\' now\\r\\nit all goes fer old bills.  We couldn\\'t do it, even if we wanted to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor half an hour more Mary begged, but she begged in vain; and though\\r\\nthe mother ended by another attack of tears, and though the two wept\\r\\ntogether in each other\\'s arms, they knew that they were together for\\r\\nthe last time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your clothes are so thin!\" quavered Mrs. Denbigh, with a pathetic\\r\\nendeavor to sink her grief in practical anxiety.  \"You ain\\'t got no\\r\\ncoat, an\\' your feet are near on the ground still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh had no money; there was literally not a cent in the\\r\\nhouse; but she unearthed from an old trunk, and pressed, for pawning,\\r\\nupon Mary, a heavy, old-fashioned gold bracelet, which had been a\\r\\nwedding-present; and, though the daughter protested that she had\\r\\nmoney enough to buy some clothes, the mother got her own coat upon\\r\\nthe daughter\\'s shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were still standing in the kitchen, as women awaiting the\\r\\nsummons of death, when first one steam-whistle and then another began\\r\\nto call across the town.  It was noon, and the moment of puddler\\r\\nDenbigh\\'s return.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word they walked, hand in hand, across the short back-yard,\\r\\nfor Mary, it was tacitly agreed, must not risk an appearance upon the\\r\\nstreet in the neighborhood of her father\\'s house.  Without a word,\\r\\nMrs. Denbigh\\'s knotted fingers opened the latch of the white-washed\\r\\ngate.  Without a word mother and daughter flung themselves into each\\r\\nother\\'s arms again, and then, still in silence, Mary trudged away.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not look back until she came to the first corner, and, when\\r\\nshe got there, she saw her mother\\'s shrunken body still at the gate,\\r\\nthe old hand waving, the aproned figure shaking with sobs.  It was\\r\\nstill there when Mary reached the second corner; but when she turned\\r\\nat the third, it was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer pain was no longer poignant.  Grief had reached the mark whence\\r\\nit passes to stupefaction; and Mary pursued her way as if her actions\\r\\nwere those suggested to a subject of hypnotic control.  In order to\\r\\navoid the crowd at the station, she walked on up the alley, until the\\r\\nalley ended in an intersecting turnpike along which ran the trolley\\r\\nline to the county-town.  She waited there, stolidly, for a car,\\r\\nmounted that, descended at the end of the road, and, after another\\r\\ndelay, climbed upon a train that would take her without change to\\r\\nJersey City.  For nearly twenty-four hours she had eaten nothing; but\\r\\nshe bought another small flask at the terminus, and, as the\\r\\nferry-boat glided between the creaking slips into the tossing water,\\r\\nshe took a deep draught of whiskey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked to the stern and looked over the side.  It was night.\\r\\nHere gleamed the railway signs under which the boat had just\\r\\npassed--the signs of those roads that, she had now discovered, ended\\r\\nas fatally for her freedom as if they had ended in an insurmountable\\r\\nwall.  Ahead towered the other walls, the black walls of that living\\r\\nprison--that vast, malevolent, conscious jail--into which she had\\r\\nonce gone with such a store of hopes whereof not one had ever been\\r\\nfulfilled, of anticipated pleasures whereof not one had ever been\\r\\ntasted, and to which she must now, to serve out a life-sentence,\\r\\nreturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust she return?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up and down the dismal river, crowded with trafficking\\r\\ncraft, and she remembered that other river at home as she had seen it\\r\\non the spring afternoon when she had played the truant from school.\\r\\nShe remembered the swirling eddies across which the nearer hills had\\r\\nbeen changing from brown to green; she remembered the descending\\r\\nDonegal Valley, fresh with germinating life, the flowering shrubs,\\r\\nand the sap-wet trees along the shore, the scent of a warm April, and\\r\\nthe music of the Susquehanna.  These things she remembered, and then\\r\\nshe looked again at the nearing city.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust she return?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe touched the rail.  Over that lay certain escape.  The deck was\\r\\ndeserted; the movement would be quick; the plunge----\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned forward, she saw the leaping, greedy, icy waves, and, with\\r\\na loud sob, staggered back to the bench that ran along the exterior\\r\\nof the upper saloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not do it.  With nothing but suffering and horrors to live\\r\\nfor, she could not put an end to life.  She was afraid of the cold;\\r\\nshe was afraid of the struggle; she was afraid of the pang; she was\\r\\nafraid of Death.  It was a new thing--Death; she had been afraid of\\r\\nit ever since that morning of her awakening when the thought of\\r\\nseeking it had first occurred to her.  Since her first crossing of\\r\\nthis water, her experiences had been a procession of new things, each\\r\\nmore terrible than the last; she had come to dread the new, and this\\r\\nnovelty of death she dreaded lest it should be the most terrible of\\r\\nall.  Life, which had robbed her of everything else, had, at this\\r\\nlast, robbed her of the courage to quit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouth, hope, purity, strength, beauty, the ability to work, even lust\\r\\nand hate--all these were dead within her, dead beyond possibility of\\r\\nresurrection.  If Max had only given her a child!  If he, or anyone\\r\\nof the others, had only killed her!  But they had murdered Love, and\\r\\nthe only thing that lived in her was the fear of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the bitterness of her own heart, out of the abysses of her own\\r\\nknowledge of things as they are, she saw much of the truth.  A rare\\r\\ngood fortune had favored Katie Flanagan; but Mary, her parents, Rose\\r\\nand her girls, Carrie, Policeman Riley and Magistrate Dyker, even\\r\\nAngel and Max--not one of them, well regarded, could be unequivocally\\r\\ncondemned.  They were all, preying or preyed upon, an inevitable\\r\\nresult.  They were but the types of millions everywhere.  New York\\r\\nitself, with all its women-slaves and men-slaves, must be but an\\r\\nillustration of what the other cities of the world are and have been.\\r\\nNo rescue of a slave could put an end to the slavery.  Something was\\r\\nwrong; but what that something was, or how it was ever to be made\\r\\nright, she could not guess.  She knew only that, down the years,\\r\\nwherever walked the great god Poverty, that great god led\\r\\nProstitution by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally comprehending, if unable to formulate, these things, at ten\\r\\no\\'clock that night Mary Denbigh, remembering what Philip Beekman had\\r\\ntold her, rang the doorbell of a familiar house and faced what she\\r\\nwould once have feared more than death--she faced complacent,\\r\\nuntroubled, prosperous, and protected Rose Légère.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman, still the good-natured woman of the brewery-calendar, cut\\r\\nshort Mary\\'s flow of apologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ferget it,\" she said.  \"It don\\'t matter what you did.  You didn\\'t\\r\\nknow any better.  Here: just take this ten dollars and tell me what\\r\\nelse I can do for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Mary pushed the money away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want that,\" she said.  \"I want--oh, Miss Rose, won\\'t you\\r\\nplease take me back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Rose, surveying the human ruin before her, shook, very\\r\\npositively, her masses of yellow hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t do that.  It wouldn\\'t be\\r\\ngood business.  You see, the life\\'s got you, Violet: you\\'re all in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_EDITOR\\'S NOTE_\\r\\n\\r\\n_The facts presented in the \"House of Bondage\" are so startling as to\\r\\nseem incredible.

THOMAS C. O\\'SULLIVAN, Judge of the\\r\\n  Court of General Sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, the members of the Additional Grand Jury for the January term,\\r\\n1910, respectfully present as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the charge delivered to us by Your Honor on the 3rd day of\\r\\nJanuary, 1910, Your Honor said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There have been spread broadcast in the public prints statements\\r\\nthat the City of New York is a center or clearing house for an\\r\\norganized traffic in women for immoral purposes, or what has come to\\r\\nbe known as the \\'white slave\\' traffic.  Some of these statements may\\r\\nhave been published with ulterior motive and may have been mere\\r\\nsensationalism, but some are said to be based upon official\\r\\ninvestigation and charges made by persons who profess to have\\r\\nknowledge of the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * * * * *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main objects:\\r\\nFirst, the procuring of women of previous chaste character, who\\r\\nthrough force, duress, or deceit are finally made to live lives of\\r\\nprostitution; second, the procuring of women who are already\\r\\nprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where they\\r\\nmay ply their trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * * * * * *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the main object, gentlemen, which I desire you to keep in mind\\r\\nthroughout your investigation is the uncovering not alone of isolated\\r\\noffenses, but of an organization, if any such exists, for a traffic\\r\\nin the bodies of women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should make your investigation sufficiently broad to cover not\\r\\nonly present conditions, but also conditions existing in the past\\r\\nwithin the statute of limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I charge you that it is your duty to pursue this inquiry into every\\r\\nchannel open to you and to present to the court the facts found by\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPursuant to Your Honor\\'s instructions, we have made an investigation\\r\\ninto the matters referred to in Your Honor\\'s charge.  We have called\\r\\nbefore our body every person whom we could find who we had reason to\\r\\nbelieve might have information on the subject.  Among others were the\\r\\nfollowing: a member of the National Immigration Commission assigned\\r\\nto investigate conditions relating to importing, seducing, and\\r\\ndealing in women in the City of New York; the author of an article\\r\\nwhich appeared in _McClure\\'s Magazine_ for November, 1909, entitled\\r\\n\"The Daughters of the Poor\"; a former under sheriff in the County of\\r\\nEssex, New Jersey; the President of the New York Society for the\\r\\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children; the author of a pamphlet entitled\\r\\n\"The White Slave Traffic\"; a member of the New York State Immigration\\r\\nCommission appointed by Governor Hughes in 1908; a former Police\\r\\nCommissioner of the City of New York; detectives and other agents\\r\\nespecially employed in connection with this investigation; members\\r\\nand ex-members of the New York Independent Benevolent Association;\\r\\nwitnesses in the specific cases presented to this Grand Jury, as well\\r\\nas a number of other citizens.  In addition, the foreman, the\\r\\nDistrict Attorney and his Assistants, have interviewed\\r\\nrepresentatives of the following organizations:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Committee of Fourteen; its Research Committee;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Society for the Suppression of Vice;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Charity Organization Society;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Committee on Amusements and Vacation Resources of Working Girls;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society for Social and Moral Prophylaxis;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Florence Crittenden Mission;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Probation Association;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Headworkers of various Social Settlements;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Women\\'s Municipal League;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society for the Prevention of Crime;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bureau of Municipal Research.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also published in the daily press of this city on the 6th day of\\r\\nMay the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Additional Grand Jury, sworn in in January by Judge O\\'Sullivan\\r\\nof the Court of General Sessions, was charged with the investigation\\r\\nof the truth or falsity of certain statements which had been publicly\\r\\nmade during the past few months to the effect that the City of New\\r\\nYork is a center or clearing house for an organized traffic in women\\r\\nfor immoral purposes, or what has come to be known as the\\r\\n\\'white-slave traffic.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pursuant to this charge the Grand Jury has been seeking legal\\r\\nevidence on this subject from all available sources.  The information\\r\\nwhich many citizens have volunteered to give has proved in most cases\\r\\nto be general rather than specific.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before closing its investigation the Grand Jury desires to announce\\r\\npublicly that it will be glad to receive definite, specific\\r\\ninformation as to the existence in this county of any traffic in\\r\\nwomen for immoral purposes from any citizen or official or other\\r\\nindividual who has such information.  Those who are willing to assist\\r\\nthe Grand Jury in its investigation are asked to call at the office\\r\\nof James B. Reynolds, Assistant District Attorney, Criminal Court\\r\\nBuilding (within the next week).  It will save the time of many\\r\\nindividuals and of Mr. Reynolds if only those appear who are willing\\r\\nand able to present facts regarding the specific matter above stated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On behalf of the Additional January Grand Jury.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, JR.,\\r\\n      \"Foreman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a part of this investigation evidence has been presented to us and\\r\\nwe have found 54 indictments:\\r\\n\\r\\n22 for rape;\\r\\n\\r\\n16 for abduction;\\r\\n\\r\\n10 for maintaining disorderly houses, 7 of which were Raines-Law\\r\\nHotels;\\r\\n\\r\\n6 for the violation of Section 2460 of the Penal Law, entitled\\r\\n\"Compulsory Prostitution of Women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have found no evidence of the existence in the County of New York\\r\\nof any organization or organizations, incorporated or otherwise,\\r\\nengaged as such in the traffic in women for immoral purposes, nor\\r\\nhave we found evidence of an organized traffic in women for immoral\\r\\npurposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears, on the other hand, from indictments found by us and from\\r\\nthe testimony of witnesses that a trafficking in the bodies of women\\r\\ndoes exist and is carried on by individuals acting for their own\\r\\nindividual benefit, and that these persons are known to each other\\r\\nand are more or less informally associated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also found that associations and clubs, composed mainly or\\r\\nwholly of those profiting from vice, have existed, and that one such\\r\\nassociation still exists.  These associations and clubs are analogous\\r\\nto commercial bodies in other fields, which, while not directly\\r\\nengaged in commerce, are composed of individuals all of whom as\\r\\nindividuals are so engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"incorporated syndicates\" and \"international bands\" referred to\\r\\nin published statements, we find to be such informal relations as\\r\\nhave just been spoken of, while the \"international headquarters,\"\\r\\n\"clearing houses\" and \"pretentious clubhouses\" mentioned are cafés or\\r\\nother so-called \"hang-outs\" where people interested in the various\\r\\nbranches of the business resort.  These and the houses of\\r\\nprostitution are also referred to as \"markets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"dealers\" and \"operators\" are the so-called \"pimps\" and\\r\\n\"procurers,\" the \"pimp\" being referred to as the \"retailer\" and the\\r\\nmanager of houses as the \"wholesaler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only association composed mainly or wholly of those profiting\\r\\nfrom vice, of the present existence of which we have evidence, is the\\r\\nNew York Independent Benevolent Association, organized in this city\\r\\nin 1894 and incorporated in 1896.  This association has had an\\r\\naverage membership of about 100.  Its alleged purpose is to assist\\r\\nits members in case of illness, to give aid in case of death, and to\\r\\nassure proper burial rites.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an exhaustive investigation into the activities of the\\r\\nassociation and of its members we find no evidence that the\\r\\nassociation as such does now or has ever trafficked in women, but\\r\\nthat such traffic is being or has been carried on by various members\\r\\nas individuals.  We find that the members of this association are\\r\\nscattered in many cities throughout the United States.  From the\\r\\ntestimony adduced it appears probable that the social relations of\\r\\nthe members and the opportunity thereby afforded of communicating\\r\\nwith one another in various cities have facilitated the conduct of\\r\\ntheir individual business.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion where a member was convicted of maintaining a\\r\\ndisorderly house and a fine of $l,000 was imposed upon him in the\\r\\nCity of Newark, New Jersey, the association voted $500 for his aid.\\r\\nOn another occasion in the City of Newark, New Jersey, where several\\r\\nof the members of the association were arrested on the charge of\\r\\nkeeping and maintaining disorderly houses, and one member was in\\r\\nprison, the then President went to Newark, declared to the Under\\r\\nSheriff that he was the President of the New York Independent\\r\\nBenevolent Association, and entered into negotiations with the\\r\\nauthorities in Newark on behalf of the members who had been arrested.\\r\\nWe have, however, no evidence of any such instance in the County of\\r\\nNew York.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears from the testimony of various members and ex-members of\\r\\nthe said association that its membership is almost entirely composed\\r\\nof persons who are now or have been engaged in the operation of\\r\\ndisorderly houses or who are living or have lived directly or\\r\\nindirectly upon the proceeds of women\\'s shame.  None of these\\r\\nwitnesses, in answer to specific questions, could name more than one\\r\\nor two present or past members whose record did not show them to have\\r\\nlived at some time upon the proceeds of prostitution in one form or\\r\\nanother.  They claim, however, that all members who have been\\r\\nconvicted of a crime are expelled from the organization when the\\r\\nproof of that fact has been submitted, the offense apparently being\\r\\nnot the commission of a crime, but conviction.  It would appear that\\r\\nthis procedure is for the purpose of protecting the individual if\\r\\npossible, and, failing in that, of freeing the association from\\r\\ncriticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding no evidence of an organized traffic in women, but of a\\r\\ntraffic carried on by individuals, we have made a special and careful\\r\\ninvestigation along this line.  Owing to the publicity given to the\\r\\ninquiry at its inception, it has been difficult to get legal evidence\\r\\nof the actual purchase and sale of women for immoral purposes, and\\r\\nour investigators have been informed in different quarters that a\\r\\nnumber of formerly active dealers in women had either temporarily\\r\\ngone out of business or had transferred their activities to other\\r\\ncities.  However, five self-declared dealers in women had agreed upon\\r\\nvarious occasions to supply women to our agents, but because of their\\r\\nextreme caution and the fear aroused by the continued sitting of this\\r\\nGrand Jury, these promises were fulfilled in only two instances, in\\r\\neach of which two girls were secured for our agents at a price, in\\r\\nthe one case of $60 each and in the other of $75 each.  Indictments\\r\\nhave been found against these two persons; one pleaded guilty and the\\r\\nother was convicted on trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these parties boasted to our investigators of their extensive\\r\\nlocal and interstate operations in the recent past.  They\\r\\nspecifically mentioned the cities to which they had forwarded women\\r\\nand described their operations as having at that time been free from\\r\\ndanger of detection.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur investigators also testified as to the methods and means used by\\r\\nthese people in replenishing the supply of women and in entrapping\\r\\ninnocent girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoting again from Your Honor\\'s charge:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main objects:\\r\\nFirst, the procuring of women of previous chaste character, who\\r\\nthrough force, duress, or deceit are finally made to live lives of\\r\\nprostitution; second, the procuring of women who are already\\r\\nprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where they\\r\\nmay ply their trade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the first heading, namely, the procuring of women of previous\\r\\nchaste character, we find the most active force to be the so-called\\r\\n\"pimp.\"  There are in the County of New York a considerable and\\r\\nincreasing number of these creatures who live wholly or in part upon\\r\\nthe earnings of girls or women who practice prostitution.  With\\r\\npromises of marriage, of fine clothing, of greater personal\\r\\nindependence, these men often induce girls to live with them and\\r\\nafter a brief period, with threats of exposure or of physical\\r\\nviolence, force them to go upon the streets as common prostitutes and\\r\\nto turn over the proceeds of their shame to their seducers, who live\\r\\nlargely, if not wholly, upon the money thus earned by their victims.\\r\\nThis system is illustrated in an indictment and conviction where the\\r\\ndefendant by such promises induced a girl of fifteen to leave her\\r\\nhome and within two weeks put her on the streets as a common\\r\\nprostitute.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find also that these persons ill-treat and abuse the women with\\r\\nwhom they live and beat them at times in order to force them to\\r\\ngreater activity and longer hours of work on the streets.  This is\\r\\nillustrated in the case of another defendant who was indicted and\\r\\nconvicted for brutally slashing with a knife the face of \"his girl\"\\r\\nand leaving her disfigured for life, merely because she was no longer\\r\\nwilling to prostitute herself for his benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this connection mention should be made of the moving picture shows\\r\\nas furnishing to this class of persons an opportunity for leading\\r\\ngirls into a life of shame.  These shows naturally attract large\\r\\nnumbers of children, and while the law provides that no child under\\r\\nthe age of sixteen shall be allowed to attend them unaccompanied by\\r\\nparent or guardian, it is a fact, as shown by the number of arrests\\r\\nand convictions that the law is frequently violated.  Evidence upon\\r\\nwhich indictments have been found and convictions subsequently\\r\\nsecured, has been given which shows that, in spite of the activities\\r\\nof the authorities in watching these places, many girls owe their\\r\\nruin to frequenting them.  An instance of the above is the case of a\\r\\ndefendant indicted by this Grand Jury and convicted before Your\\r\\nHonor, where three girls met as many young men at a Harlem moving\\r\\npicture show.  At the end of the performance, the young men were\\r\\ntaken by an employee of the place through a door in the rear into a\\r\\nconnecting building--used as a fire exit for the moving picture\\r\\nshow--where they met the girls and all passed the night together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has furnished\\r\\nstatistics showing that since the 13th day of December, 1906, 33\\r\\ncases of rape and seduction originated in moving picture shows, in\\r\\nsome instances the perpetrators being the employees of the shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the purpose of this reference to bring an indictment\\r\\nagainst the moving picture show, which under proper restrictions may\\r\\nbe an important and valuable educational and recreative factor, but\\r\\nrather to point out possible dangers inherent in performances carried\\r\\non in the darkness and the importance of the observance of safeguards\\r\\nby parents or guardians, and of the strict enforcement of the law for\\r\\nthe protection of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the second heading in that portion of Your Honor\\'s charge\\r\\nquoted above, which refers to the procuring of women who are already\\r\\nprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where they\\r\\nmay ply their trade, the Grand Jury has made a special study of the\\r\\nclass of disorderly houses commonly known as \"Raines-Law Hotels,\" the\\r\\nchief business of many of which is to provide a place where women of\\r\\nthe streets may take their customers.  The testimony given shows that\\r\\ngirls who brought their patrons to certain hotels of this class were\\r\\nallowed rebates on the amount charged their patrons for rooms.  Upon\\r\\nthe evidence brought before us, indictments were found against seven\\r\\nof the most notorious of these hotels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abuse which has grown up in the conversion of the so-called\\r\\nmassage and manicure parlor into a disorderly house, frequently of\\r\\nthe most perverted kind, has received our careful study under this\\r\\nsame heading.  A special investigation has been made of some 125\\r\\nmassage and manicure parlors, in this county.  Less than half of\\r\\nthese establishments were found to be equipped for legitimate\\r\\npurposes, most of them being nothing but disorderly houses.  The\\r\\noperators in such places had no knowledge of massage treatment, and\\r\\nin certain cases where certificates of alleged massage institutes\\r\\nwere on the walls of the premises they frankly admitted that they had\\r\\nno training in massage and did not even know the persons whose\\r\\nsignatures appeared on the certificates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn view of the above, it would seem important that these parlors\\r\\nshould be licensed by the Health Department of the city and that all\\r\\noperators in them should also have a license from some approved\\r\\nhealth or medical authority, and further, that proper supervision\\r\\nshould be exercised to insure their operation for the legitimate\\r\\npurposes for which they are licensed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spreading of prostitution in its various forms from the\\r\\nwell-known disorderly house into apartment and tenement houses\\r\\npresents a very grave danger to the home.  It is inevitable that\\r\\nchildren who have daily evidence of the apparent comfort, ease, and\\r\\noftentimes luxury in which women of this class live should not only\\r\\nbecome hardened to the evil, but be easily drawn into the life.  The\\r\\nexisting laws for the suppression of this vice in apartment and\\r\\ntenement houses should be most rigorously enforced and if necessary\\r\\nadditional legislation enacted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of the evils investigated under this head, the most menacing is\\r\\nthe so-called \"pimp\" who, as already stated, while often active in\\r\\nseducing girls, is, to what seems to be an increasing extent, living\\r\\non the earnings of the professional prostitute, constantly driven by\\r\\nhim to greater activity and more degrading practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not find that these persons are formally organized, but it\\r\\nwould appear that the majority of the women of the street, as well as\\r\\nmany of those who practice prostitution in houses or flats, are\\r\\ncontrolled by them and usually pay their entire earnings to them.\\r\\nThey prescribe the hours and working places for these women, assist\\r\\nthem in getting customers, protect them from interference when\\r\\npossible, and when the women are arrested do what they can to procure\\r\\ntheir release.  While \"their women\" are at work, they spend much of\\r\\ntheir time in saloons and other resorts where they gather socially.\\r\\nAlthough operating individually, their common interest leads them to\\r\\ncoöperate for mutual protection or for the recovery of women who may\\r\\ndesert them, and for the maintenance of their authority over their\\r\\nparticular women.  It is an unwritten law among these men that the\\r\\nauthority of the individual over the woman or women controlled by him\\r\\nis unquestioned by his associates to whatever extreme it may be\\r\\ncarried.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo obtain a conviction against one of this class is most difficult,\\r\\nfor through fear or personal liking, \"his woman\" is loath to become a\\r\\nwitness against him, and without her evidence conviction is almost\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever one may think of the woman who adopts the profession of a\\r\\nprostitute by choice, all must agree that the man who in cold blood\\r\\nexploits a woman\\'s body for his own support and profit is vile and\\r\\ndespicable beyond expression.  Only through the arousing of an\\r\\nintelligent and determined public sentiment which will back up the\\r\\nforces of law in their effort to ferret out and bring to justice the\\r\\nmembers of this debased class, is there hope of stamping out those\\r\\nvilest of human beings found to-day in the leading cities of this and\\r\\nother lands.\\r\\n\\r\\n--------\\r\\n\\r\\nIn view of the foregoing we recommend:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. That no effort be spared in bringing to justice the so-called\\r\\n\"pimp.\"  When the character and prevalence of these creatures are\\r\\nmore fully realized and public sentiment aroused regarding them, the\\r\\ninadequate punishment now imposed should be increased and every\\r\\nlegitimate means devised and put into execution to exterminate them.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. That the existing laws be more rigidly enforced to safeguard the\\r\\npatrons of the moving picture shows, and that parents and guardians\\r\\nexercise more careful supervision over their children in connection\\r\\nwith their attendance upon these shows.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. That vigorous efforts be made to minimize the possibility of the\\r\\nRaines-Law Hotel becoming a disorderly house, and that where\\r\\nnecessary proper supervision and inspection looking toward that end\\r\\nbe provided.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. That the so-called massage and manicure parlors be put under the\\r\\ncontrol of the Health Department; that a license from this department\\r\\nbe required for their operation; that certificates be granted to\\r\\noperators only by some approved medical authority, and that proper\\r\\nmeasures be taken to enforce these laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. That the laws relating to prostitution in apartment and tenement\\r\\nhouses be rigidly enforced, and that the present laws be supplemented\\r\\nif necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. That a commission be appointed by the Mayor to make a careful\\r\\nstudy of the laws relating to and the methods of dealing with the\\r\\nsocial evil in the leading cities of this country and of Europe, with\\r\\na view to devising the most effective means of minimizing the evil in\\r\\nthis city.\\r\\n\\r\\n    JOHN D.

Itis intended for those who have to bring up children, for those whohave to bring up themselves, and for those who, in order that theymay think of bettering the weaker, are, on their own part, strongenough to begin that task by bearing a knowledge of the truth.For it is the truth only that I have told.  Throughout this narrativethere is no incident that is not a daily commonplace in the life ofthe underworld of every large city.  If proof were needed, thenewspapers have, during the last twelvemonth, proved as much.  I havewritten only what I have myself seen and myself heard, and I set itdown for none but those who may profit by it.REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN.  NEW YORK CITY,    _16th June, 1910_THE HOUSE OF BONDAGEI\"AS IF THE SPRING WERE ALL YOUR OWN\"The local weather-prophets--the cape-coated Mennonites and thebearded Amishmen, who came into the town to market--had said, withchoral unanimity, that the spring would be brief and sudden, and thesummer parching and intense.Already, though April had but dawned, the pink arbutus had bloomedand withered, and the pale first violets were peeping, purple andfragrant, among the lush grass of the front yards on Second Street.The annual oriole was a full fortnight ahead of his time in openinghis summer-house in the hickory-tree on the Southwarks\\' lawn; and upin the droning study-room of the high-school, where all the windowswere wide to the lazy sunlight, Miss England had begun, this week, todirect the thoughts of her dwindling senior-class toward the subjectsof their graduation essays.Swaying with the easy, languid grace of an unstudied young animal,Mary Denbigh, the morning-session ended, turned from the graveledwalk before the school-grounds into the little town\\'s chiefthoroughfare.Nobody had ever called her pretty, but her light serge skirt had thatday been lengthened to her ankles, and Mary was wholly conscious ofthe new tokens of her growth.  Lithe, strong-limbed and firm-bodied,of peasant stock and peasant vigor, youth and health and the opencountry air were not factors sufficiently unfamiliar to combine in acharm that would attract admiration in her own community.  Only ajaded city-gaze--and a well-trained city-gaze at that--would haveseen in the blue eyes, the red mouth, the straight nose, pink cheeks,and abundant russet hair, any promise worthy of fulfillment,--couldhave detected the flower in the bud; and that such a gaze should, onthis day of all days, have been leveled in the girl\\'s direction was,perhaps, only one of those grim jests of a Fate that loves to playupon the harmony between man and nature, and that here observed thecoming of a human spring that must be brief and sudden, a humansummer parching and intense.The usual group of idle residents and idling commercial drummers weresitting at the plate-glass window of the hotel as she went by, butthe girl did not see them.  Passing among objects of longfamiliarity, she saw, in fact, nothing until, in a side-street, sheheard a rapid step behind her, was covered by an approaching shadowand, half-turning, found someone, a stranger, at her side.\"How d\\'y\\'do, liddle girl?\"Mary looked up; but she was quite too startled to observe anythingsave that the speaker--she could not have told whether he were man orboy--was at once dark and rosy, smiling and serious, hat in hand,and, beyond all speculation, no citizen of her own borough.\"I don\\'t know you,\" she said.She flushed quickly, and strode forward.  It was, she knew, nouncommon thing for the girls of her acquaintance to be \"picked up,\"as they called the process, by some fellow-townsman that had neverbeen formally presented to them; but the process was, as she alsoknew, one that lost its propriety when extended to aliens.The present alien was, nevertheless, not easily to be dismissed.  Hefell into her gait, and walked facilely beside her.\"I beg your _par_don,\" he said in the humblest and mostunobjectionable tones.  \"I don\\'t mean to be _rude_ to you, honest, Idon\\'t.  I\\'m a traveling-man, you see----\"Mary was striding rapidly ahead, her full mouth now drawn firm, herblue eyes fixed on the vanishing-point.\"I don\\'t care what you are,\" she answered.\"All righd,\" he pleaded.  \"All I vant now is a chanc\\'t to _exblain_.I\\'ve chust started out traveling for my fader, who\\'s a big distillerin N\\'York.  I\\'ve got to stay in this hole for a vhile, un\\' I\\'m notused to the _bees_ness, un\\' I\\'m lonesome, un\\' I only vondered if youvouldn\\'t go vith me to a moving-picture show, or something, thisevening.\"The best way to deal with such a situation is a way that is easiestfor the inexperienced and the unpolished.  Mary was both.  For thefirst time since he had begun to walk beside her, she now, coming toa defiant stop, faced her annoyer.\"I don\\'t know you,\" she repeated.  \"I\\'ve told you that onc\\'t, andyou\\'d better not make me tell you any more still.  I live the seconddoor round the coming corner, and my pop is a puddler an\\' weighs twohundred and ten pounds!\"Again she wheeled and again resumed her homeward march; and this timeshe walked alone.  If she heard, dimly, behind her a confused murmurof response, she did not hesitate to learn whether the words wereexpressions of further apology or new-born dismay, and when she ran,flushed and panting, up the three wooden steps to the two-story brickhouse that was her home, though she could not then deny herself onebackward glance, that glance revealed to her only an empty corner.The pursuit had ended.She flung open the light door that was never locked by day, walkeddown the short, darkened hall, past the curtain of the equallydarkened parlor, through the dining-room with its pine table coveredby a red cotton cloth, and so into the small, crowded kitchen, whereher mother fretted and clattered above the highly polished range.Mrs. Denbigh was a little Pennsylvania-German woman, whom a sternreligion and a long life of hard work had not intellectuallyenlarged.  In spite of the fact that she had borne eight children, ofwhom Mary was the seventh, her sympathies had failed to broaden, andher equally religious and equally hard-working Welsh husband usedoften to remark to her, during his one-monthly evening ofintoxication, that he was glad indeed she was to have no moreprogeny, since, somehow or other, she \"seemed to git wuss temperedwith every innocent youngling as koom to \\'un.\"  Whether thiscriticism was or was not precise, it is at least true that muchdrudgery had not improved the weary woman\\'s temper; that the longyears before her husband rose to his present wages--years duringwhich his wife had not only kept a house and reared a family, but hadalso added to the communal income by night-work as a dress-maker--hadleft her gray and stooped and hatchet-faced; and that, though of arace in which the maternal instinct runs almost to a passion, herpatience with her remaining pair of home-biding children wasfrequently fragile and short.Just now she looked up, a spoon in one hand and a pan in the other,her forehead damp, as always, with sweat, and her harassed eyesmomentarily bright with anger.\"Where on earth have you been, anyways?\" she shrilly inquired of Mary.The girl\\'s face instantly hardened from the excitement of her recentadventure to the sullenness behind which she always took refuge inthese more usual domestic crises.  What she might have confessed hadshe come home to a less overworked mother, it is, obviously, vain toconjecture; what she actually did was to lock within her breast thestory that had been trembling on her red lips, and what she repliedto Mrs. Denbigh\\'s question was an ungracious:\"Been at school.  Where d\\'you think?\"The mother straightened up as far as her long-stooped shoulders wouldpermit.\"Think?\" she echoed.  \"I guess I can guess still where you was.\\'Less you was kep\\' in, you had ought t\\' been home five minutes ago,an\\' nobody\\'s kep\\' in only five minutes.  You\\'ve been flirtin\\' withsome idiot of a boy on the street-corner yet--that\\'s about whatyou\\'ve been doin\\'!\"It was a random shot, and one fired from no previous knowledge, butthe girl at once realized that, had any neighbor chanced to see whathad actually occurred, this parental construction would appear tohave some foundation in fact.  The thought was enough to seal thelocked gate in her breast.\"That ain\\'t so!\" she said, with childish fury.  \"I come straighthome, like I always do.  If you want me to help more with the workthan I do help, why don\\'t you let me quit school?  I don\\'t want to goany more, anyhow.\"There are some families in which the passing of the lie is no suchuncommon or serious offense, and the Denbigh _ménage_ was one ofthem.  It was, therefore, upon the latter portion of Mary\\'s speechthat her mother, at this time, seized.\"You\\'ll go to school as long as your pop and me say you must!\" sheretorted.\"You let our Etta quit when she was in the grammar school,\"expostulated Mary, with an appeal to the precedent of thesuccessfully married sister, who was now a next-door neighbor.  \"Youlet her quit then, and now I\\'m in the high.\"Had Mrs. Denbigh\\'s rejoinder been in accordance with the facts, shewould have said that all she wanted to do was to give her daughter asmuch of an education as was compatible with the proper conduct of theDenbigh domestic economy.  But tired women are no more apt to indulgein analytical exposition than are tired men, and so it chanced thather next speech, accompanied by a gesture that raised thecooking-spoon aloft, was a torrent of words unexpectedly interrupted.\"In the high?\" she repeated.  \"Well, I know where you\\'ll be in oneminute, still, if you don\\'t right away----\"She brought the spoon forward with a mighty swoop, but its parabola,in crossing the stove, sent it into violent contact with the pot thatheld the stew destined for the noon dinner.  The pot was balanced onthe edge of an aperture in the stove whence the lid had been removed.The vessel fell, and its contents belched upon the burning coals.Mrs. Denbigh gave one look at the steaming ruin, and then seized thealready retreating Mary.  The girl\\'s struggles, her cries, thedignity of the newly lengthened skirt, avail nothing.  A dozen timesthe mother\\'s arm descended in stinging castigation, and then shehurried her daughter into the hall.\"You git right back to school!\" she ordered.  \"I don\\'t care if you\\'rea half-hour early--you\\'re mostly late enough.  You\\'ve spoiled yourown dinner and mine and little Sallie\\'s, so you don\\'t git nothin\\' toeat still till evening.  You\\'ll go to school, and you\\'ll keep ongoin\\' till your pop an\\' me tells you to quit!\"Mary looked at the woman without a word, and then, still without aword, passed through the front door and banged it behind her.But she did not walk in the direction of the school; she was notgoing to school.  The rebel-spirit of youth choked her, and turnedher feet, almost without will of her own, toward the river.She crossed the railroad tracks, came to the disused towpath andfollowed it for a mile beyond the town.  Far westward she went,\"walking,\" as she would have said, \"her madness down,\" and, hungrythough she now was, she did not rest until at last, as late as threeo\\'clock in the afternoon, she sat on a rock at the point where theSusquehanna curves between the sheer precipice of Chicques on theLancaster County side and the hooded nose of the high hill they callthe Point, upon the other.The flood of rebellion had ceased, but a steady and enduring streamof resolution remained.Across the sweep of eddies she saw the nearer hills already sheddingthe browns and blacks of winter\\'s bared limbs and pine branches forthe tenderer green of a gentler season.  The cultivated portions ofthe summits were already rich with coming life.  Behind her rolledthe Donegal Valley, where the crops were even then germinating.Birds were mating in the sap-wet trees beside the water, and from theflowering seeds there came the subtle, poignant scent of a warm April.Something--something new and nameless and wonderful--rose in herthroat and left her heart hammering an answer to the new world aroundher.  She was glad--glad in spite of all her anger and her hunger;glad that she had not told her mother of the boy--for he must havebeen a boy--whom she had, after all, so needlessly reprimanded; butglad, above everything else, for some reason, for some intoxicationthat she might neither then nor ever after completely understand.Her cheeks glowed a deeper pink; her blue eyes glistened; she openedher red mouth to the seductive sun and, with a sweep of her firmhands, flung loose her russet hair to the breeze.  Looking out at thedistant fields, she sprang to her feet again and walked, swaying withthe easy, languid grace of an unstudied young animal.The fields reminded her of the rural prophets.  It was evident, shethought, that they were right: this year\\'s was to be a spring briefand sudden, a summer parching and intense.IIA DEED OF TRUSTMary Denbigh could not remember the day when the holy estate ofmatrimony had not been held up to her by others as the whole destinyof woman and had not presented itself as the natural, the easy, thesole path of escape from filial servitude.She belonged, as has been intimated, to a race in which motherhood isan instinctive passion and an economic necessity, and she was borninto a class in which not to marry is socially shameful andmaterially precarious.  When she was very small, her own dolls wereher own children and her playmates\\' dolls her children-in-law, and,when she grew older, she had always before her the sedulouslymaintained illusion of emancipation worn by those girls, but a fewyears her seniors, who had given up the drudgery of childhood, whichshe hated, for the drudgery of wifehood, which they loftilyconcealed.  A young wife was a superior being, whose condition wasnot at all to be judged by the known condition of one\\'s mother, andall the other and more intimate relations of marriage remained, tothe uninitiate, a charmed mystery.  If it seems strange to us thatthis mystery and this innocence remained to Mary at sixteen, thereflection rests not upon her from whom the secret kept its secrecy,but upon us to whom the innocence appears remarkable.From a house that exacted everything and forgave nothing, a narrowhouse, which she could not see as simply an inevitable result ofconditions as wide as the world, the girl looked out to thatwonderful house next door where her sister had, only three yearsbefore, been taken as a bride.  This sister was now an elegantperson, who said \"fore-head,\" \"of-ten,\" and \"a-gain,\" but Mary couldremember Etta, in gingham frock and apron, performing the tasks thatwere now enforced upon Mary herself.  And she could now observe--as,indeed, her sister\\'s wholly conscious pride well intended that sheshould observe--Etta in clothes that were beyond the reach of anunmarried daughter of Owen Denbigh; Etta going to dances forbidden toa Denbigh maid.  When she climbed reluctantly to bed at ten o\\'clock,Etta\\'s lights blazed always wide awake, and when she rose in the grayof the morning, Etta\\'s shutters were luxuriously closed.Every dawn Mary must pack her father\\'s dinner-bucket, as Etta used topack it, before Owen started for the mill.  That done, and thehurried breakfast eaten, she must make her own bed and wash thedishes before she set out for school.  At noon there were moredishes, and only every other evening, before sitting down to detestedstudy by the kerosene lamp in the dining-room, was she relieved ofstill more dish-washing by the growing, and apparently too favored,younger sister, Sallie.The evening that followed Mary\\'s truant walk along the river was oneof those when she should have been granted this modicum of relief,but now, after the brief five o\\'clock supper, tow-headed Sallie setup a wail as the table was cleared.\"What\\'s the matter with you now?\" demanded Mrs. Denbigh, her harassedeyes blinking in the lamplight, and her hatchet-face more thancommonly sharp.\"I ain\\'t feelin\\' good,\" said Sallie.  \"I\\'m tired; I\\'m sick; I don\\'twant to wash no dishes.\"Mrs. Denbigh shot a glance through the double-doorway to the litteredparlor; but the face of her unattentive husband was hidden behind thecrinkling sheets of the _Daily Spy_, gripped by one great, grimyfist, while the stubby forefinger of the other hand spelled out theshort syllables of the personal-column, facetiously headed \"OurCard-Basket.\"  His huge bulk bulged over all the edges of theuncomfortable patent armchair in which he was sitting: a picture ofgorged contentment, there was as yet no help to be expected from him.It was Mary, experienced in such attacks, who made ready to defendthe law.\"You ain\\'t sick,\" she declared.\"I am, too!\" sniffed Sallie.  \"I\\'m awful sick!\"\"Get out: you et more\\'n I did.  You just want to make me do the work,an\\' I won\\'t, \\'cause it\\'s your turn.  So there!\"Mary\\'s homecoming had, as it happened, not been the signal for arenewal of hostilities between her mother and herself.  The formerhad just then been too hard at work to have either energy or thoughtin that direction, and throughout the evening meal the girl haddeemed it wise to maintain a reticence calculated to keep her in thedomestic background.  Now, however, she had impulsively come forward,and the step at once brought her to Mrs. Denbigh\\'s attention.\"After what you done this noon,\" she said to Mary, \"you\\'d better keepyour mouth shut.  Go and wash them dishes!\"But Mary knew that she had now gone too far to retreat.\"It wasn\\'t my fault the stew was spilled,\" she protested; \"andanyhow, you did lick me onc\\'t for that.  Sallie just wants to shoveher work off on me.\"\"I don\\'t,\" blubbered Sallie.  \"I\\'ll do \\'em some evenin\\' when it\\'syour turn.\"\"Yes,\" Mary sneered, \"I know how you will.\"\"I will--I will--I will so!\"Sallie\\'s voice rose to a shrill shriek, and then suddenly broke offin the middle of a note: there was a sound of elephantine stirringfrom the parlor, and the feared master of the house, moved at lastfrom his lethargy, rolled into the double doorway and seemed nearlyto block it.One of the young reporters of _The Spy_ had once remarked--not inprint--that Owen Denbigh resembled nothing so much as the stern of anarmored cruiser seen from a catboat.  How much of the covering of hispowerful frame was fat and how much muscle is matter for conjecture;his life in the iron mills had certainly given him a strength atleast approaching the appearance, and had blackened his large hands,reddened his big face, and grayed his bristling hair and his fiercelyflaring mustache.\"Whad\\'s ahl this devil\\'s racket?\" he shouted, in the voice he used intriumphing over the turmoil of the puddling-furnace.Both children quailed before him, each prepared regardless of itsmerits, for acquittal or condemnation, as he might decide the issue.Even Mrs. Denbigh drew back and set her lips to silence.The giant raised a threatening hand.\"Be ye ahl gone deef?\" he demanded.  \"Whad\\'s ahl this devil\\'s racketfur?\"In a panic of self-preservation, the two girls began at once toclamor forth their woes.\"Sallie won\\'t wash the dishes!\" cried Mary.\"I\\'m sick,\" sobbed Sarah, \"an\\' mom says Mary must wash \\'em becauseshe upset the stew this noon-time!\"In the merits of any case brought before him, the household Solomonwas as little interested as if he had been the judge of a law-court.His years of overwork had limited his sense of a just division oftoil among others, and his long oppression by task-masters had madehimself a merciless task-master.  Like the men that had driven him,he delighted most in driving those who were the hardest to drive.Sallie was too young to furnish appreciable resistance, but in theawakening Mary he now saw something that approached worthyopposition.  He turned first to his wife.\"Did you tell \\'er,\" he inquired, his stubby forefinger leveled atMary--\"did you tell \\'er to wash \\'un?\"Mrs. Denbigh bowed her sweating forehead in timid assent.Then the father looked again at the offender.\"Wash \\'un!\" he ordered, and marched back to his parlor, his armchair,and his evening paper.Mary knew her father too well not to know also the price ofdisobedience.  Sullenly, but without hesitation, she retreated to thelittle kitchen and took up her uncongenial task.Girlhood, then, must be denied much of its claim to recreation; thesocial machine was pitiless.  Young life was a period of menialservice from which the sole escape was marriage, whether to strangeror to friend.  That a stranger should harm her was, to Mary--as it isto most girls of her age and environment--an idea unentertained:strangers were too few, and the world of moral fact too closely shutand guarded.  Boys she had always been cautioned against in vaguegeneralities; but she understood that they were prohibited becausetheir company was a delectable luxury reserved for older andmarriageable girls whose younger sisters were needed only to help inthe household tasks.Rebellion once more reddened her heart--rebellion, as she thought,against her own particular condition, but the old rebellion,actually, that burns, at one time or another, in every heart: therevolt of the individual, more or less conscious of itsindividuality, against the conditions that are combined to crush it.She poured the water from the heavy iron tea-kettle into the tindishpan with a quick anger that was not eased when two or three ofthe scalding drops leaped back against her bared, round arms.  Sheflung the home-boiled soap after the water, and she clattered thedishes as loudly as she dared.  Through the window--her soul hot withthe sense of the injustice done her--she could see the happy lightsin Etta\\'s house, and, her hands deep in the greasy fluid, it came toher suddenly that she had been a fool to neglect--torepudiate--to-day what might have been the golden chance to such anestate as her sister\\'s.She had heard the protesting Sarah sent to bed; had heard her motherreturn to the parlor with the sewing-basket, and, finally, as she wasputting away the last of the dishes in the china-closet in thedining-room, she caught the voices of both of her parents.Dimly glimpsed from the small apartment beyond, she knew the scenewell enough to reconstruct it perfectly.  The crowded little parlorwas like a hundred others in the immediate neighborhood, amathematical result of the community of which it was a part.  Therewere the two front windows with the horse-hair chairs before eachand, between them, the marble-top table bearing the family Bible.There was the gilt mirror over the gorgeously lambrequinedmantelpiece, which was littered with a brass clock,dried-grass-bearing yellow vases, stiff photographs of dead ormarried younger Denbighs, and \"memorial cards\" with illegible giltlettering upon a ground of black.  Close by the cabinet-organ on oneside and the green sofa on the other--the sofa adorned with a lace\"tidy\" that would never remain neatly in its place--her father andmother sat, separated by the purple-covered center-table, their gazeinterrupted by the tall glass case that contained the bunch of white_immortelles_ from the grave of their eldest son.Mrs. Denbigh was finishing, it seemed, the narrative of the town\\'slatest scandal.\"I never knowed Mrs. Drumbaugh was that soft-hearted,\" the mother wassaying.  \"Nobody in town was fooled over the reason for why herJennie went away, an\\' yet here the girl comes back a\\'ready, and Mrs.Drumbaugh, church-member though she is, takes her into the houseag\\'in--her an\\' her baby along with her.\"What was it in the words that brought Mary to a sudden pause?  Hermother had always been, like most drudges, a gossip, and had sought,in repeating scandal about her acquaintances, that relief fromdrudgery which she knew how to obtain only by this second-hand thrillof evil.  The girl had heard and disregarded the telling of many sucha tale, and yet, to-night, she stood there first listening inuncomprehending horror to the narrative and then awaiting theinevitable paternal comment upon it.\"Tuke \\'er bahk, hey?\" rumbled Owen Denbigh.  \"Well, ef she bay soocha fule, she deserves the scandal ov\\'t.  Thank God no youngling o\\'ourn ever went the devil\\'s way.  I hahve ahlways bin sure what I\\'d doto \\'un ef she did, though.\"He paused a moment, as if to have his wife inquire as to the terriblepunishment that he had reserved for such an error, and then, as noinquiry was forthcoming, he gave his statement at any rate, with allthe cold ferocity of a Judge Jeffries pronouncing sentence.\"Bay \\'un thirty year old an\\' noot another sin ag\\'in \\'un,\" hedeclared, \"I would beat \\'un within a bare inch o\\' \\'er deeth, an\\' turn\\'un oot to live the life \\'un had picked fur herself!\"The whole intent of that speech Mary was incapable of comprehending,but she understood enough to tremble and then to fan to destructivefury the fire of her rebellion.  Of a sudden, the atmosphere of thehouse had become unendurable.  She was gasping like a sparrow under abell-glass.Stealthily she crept into the hall.  Carefully she took her coat andfaded hat from the rack.  Very gently she opened the front door andstole into the street.  She felt dumbly that the world was wrong,that youth should not have to work, and that to seize the fruit ofpleasure should not be matter far punishment, but for congratulation.I do not think that she meant to pass by the hotel that evening.  Ido not believe that most of us, in such moments, are actuated anymore by motive than we are directed by discretion.  Nevertheless,when the clutch of her emotions had enough loosened from her throatto permit her to take account of her whereabouts, the time, and theplace, it was a quarter after six by the town-clock; Mary was justbefore the plate-glass window where the drummers sat, and, only aminute later, the stranger of the morning was again at her side.\"Von\\'t you chust say that you\\'re not _mad_ vith me?\" he was asking.She was so frightened that she was conscious of no other definitesensation, much less of any ordered thought or opinion; but shelooked fairly at him, and of what she saw she was immediately fullyaware.He was a young man, but the sort of young man that might be anywherefrom nineteen to thirty-two, because he had the figure and the faceof the former age and the eyes and the expression of the latter.  Thehair on his head was black and curly; though his hands were not theworking-hands with which Mary was best acquainted, they were almostcovered with a lighter down of the same growth; and through the paleolive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks shone the blue-black hint ofa wiry beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thick when he didnot smile and thin when he did, with teeth very white; and his grayglance had a penetrating calculation about it that made the girlinstinctively draw her coat together and button it.To his speech she could pay, just then, scarcely any attention,except to feel that its quick, thick quality, and its ictus on thevowels, denoted the foreigner; but his clothes were a marvel thatwould not be denied.  His coat and trousers of green were cut in theextreme of a fashion that was new to her; his brown plush hat wasturned far down on one side and far up on the other; his waistcoat,of purple striped by white, was held by large mother-of-pearlbuttons, and his shoes, long and pointed, were the color of lemons.Impulsively she had refused an answer to his first words; but theyoung man was a member of the persistent race, and speedily followedthe first speech with a second.\"Chust say the vord,\" he pleaded, \"und I von\\' bother you no more.  Ionly vanted to make myself _square_ vith you.\"Mary hesitated.  Something, she knew, she feared, but whether it wasthe man, herself, or the habit of obedience she could not tell.  Hewas polite, he was respectful; he came, it was clear, from a happierworld than her own--and, as against her own she was now in openrevolt, a certain parley with this visitor from an alien orb seemedlikely to constitute a fitting declaration of independence.Conditions had worked upon her to desperation, and the sameconditions, little as she guessed it, had, under the mask of chance,inevitably provided this avenue of protest.\"Oh,\" she said, \"I\\'m not mad at you, if that\\'s what you want to know.\"\"I\\'m glad of that,\" he easily answered, as they turned, quitenaturally, away from the main street.  \"But I thought you gonsideredme _fresh_.\"\"Well, I hadn\\'t never been introduced to you, you know.\"The young man laughed.\"I\\'ll introduce myself!\" said he.  \"My name\\'s Max Grossman--not myreal name, because I vas born in Hungary an\\' nobody could say my realname ofer here.  My fader is a big distiller in New York--he\\'s vorthhalf a million un\\' more: anybody\\'ll tell you about him.  \\'Und he\\'sput me on the road for him.\"This and much more he told her in the following minutes.  He drew atruly brilliant picture of his parental home, and, animadverting nowand then with scorn on the town in which he now found himself, hepainted in the highest colors the glory of Manhattan.New York, it appeared, was a city of splendid leisure.  Its entirefour millions of population spent their days in rest and their nightsin amusement.  There were the rumbling cable-cars, the roaringelevated trains, the subway expresses, which reached out and drew theBattery within twenty minutes of the Bronx.  There were the realitiesthat had been only vague magic names to this girl: the East Side, theBowery, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Waldorf.  Nobody went tobed before three o\\'clock in the morning, or woke before one in theafternoon.  Nobody was ugly and nobody was old.  There were no booksto study, no errands to run, no dishes to wash.  There were only thecabs and the taxis to ride in, the hundred theaters to see, the cafésand the music, Fifth Avenue with its palaces, and Broadway, fromThirty-fourth to Forty-third \"von big, yellow, happy electric lighd.\"She listened.  As he spoke, though she did not know it, the far-offorchestras were calling her, as if the sound of the city deafened herto all other sounds, as if the lights of New York blinded her to thelights of home.Her own story, as she in turn briefly told it to him, provided herwith the one touch of contrast needed to make the lure of the newdream complete, provided him with the one text necessary for theimplications he frankly wanted her to receive.  She was already sometropolitan that, when she agreed to go to the moving-picture show,she passed the portals of \"The Happy Hour,\" as the place wasoptimistically entitled, with a superior scorn for all that it had tooffer.The narrow hall was dark when they entered--Max pocketing the largeroll of yellow bills from which he had drawn the price of theiradmission--and, as they sat down, half-way toward the stage, therewas being shown, on the screen, the absurd adventures of a tramp, whoentered an ornate hotel grill-room and who, among wondering,well-dressed guests, was proceeding to order an elaborate meal.\"That\\'s the _As_tor,\" whispered Max, loudly.  \"I\\'d know id anyvheres.\"The pictured tramp was, of course, unable to pay his score, and,equally, of course, was pursued as he leaped through an open window.Max acted as Mary\\'s guide during the tableaux of the chase thatfollowed.  Now the quarry was darting among the congested traffic ofTimes Square; now he had clambered over the platform of aForty-second Street surface-car; now he was running up the steepstairway of the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" and now, the hunters close at hisheels, he was dashing along Thirty-fourth Street past the Waldorf,turning down toward the Park Avenue Hotel, and so, at last, wascaught at the nearby entrance to the subway.When the lights flared up at the conclusion of the little drama, Marysighed as if suddenly plunged from fairyland down to the real worldbelow.  And then the sigh changed to a gasp of fright: in the samerow, only six seats away, her sister Etta was sitting.The girl started to rise.\"Vhat\\'s wrong?\" asked the astonished Max.\"I must go.  Don\\'t come out with me.  Wait a minute, and then follow.I\\'ll be at the next corner up street.  That\\'s our Etta over there!\"But Max did not seem fully to comprehend the warning.  He rose withMary, and made some stir in doing it, so that, as the pair reachedthe aisle, Etta\\'s eyes were drawn in the direction of her sister andthe man.Mary, though she hastily turned her head, thought that she sawrecognition in this sudden glance.  She thought that she sawrecognition turn to amazement, and amazement to rebuke.  Instantly,there rose before her the reefs of ultimate domestic disaster.  WithMax in close attendance, she hurried to the door.Outside she did not speak until they had reached the comparativeseclusion of a less frequented street.  Then she turned hotly uponthe youth, whom she considered the cause of her peril.\"Why was you such a fool?\" she demanded.  \"Didn\\'t you hear me say foryou not to come out when I did?\"\"I didn\\'t understand you,\" Max humbly expostulated.  \"But vhatdifference does it make, anyvays?\"\"Difference?  Why, you were so blamed noisy that Etta looked roundan\\' seen me.  She\\'ll go straight home and tell pop I was here withyou.\"\"Vell,\" protested Max, \"it\\'s not seven o\\'clock yet, und I\\'m noteatin\\' you, vas I?\"\"That don\\'t matter.  You don\\'t know my pop!\"\"Vhat\\'ll he do?\"\"He\\'ll\"--Mary remembered previous punishments for smaller offenses,and recalled the judgment that she had heard her father pronounce ona hypothetical offender.  \"He\\'ll beat me till I\\'m near dead,\" shedeclared; \"an\\' then, like as not, he\\'ll turn me out of the house.\"They were at pause in the shadow of an old buttonwood tree, Maxleaning against the gnarled trunk, the girl facing him, erect.Even as she sketched her possible punishment, the possible becameprobable.  She was afraid, and this young man, who had been sodeferential, so protecting, who had given her so alluring a glimpseof another world, seemed her only refuge.He put out his hands and, gently, took both of hers.At that touch the last of her anger melted, almost to tears.\"Look here,\" he said.  \"I\\'ve been decent to you, haven\\'t I?  I ain\\'ttried to get fresh?\"She shook her head, not trusting speech.\"Vell, then, listen here,\" he pursued.  \"If your old man gets gay,chust remember _that_.  You ain\\'t treated righd at home, the best oftimes.  You said so yourself.  Un\\' this here jay town\\'s no _place_for a pretty young lady like you, anyvays.  So, if there\\'s anytrouble, you come for me, und I\\'ll get you avay from here.\"The girl thrilled with a delicious sense of adventure.  She trembledwith the foretaste of a new delight.  The passing praise of her looksand of her newly acquired maturity, a novel sound in her ears, wasnot lost upon her; but even that was dwarfed by the tenor of hercompanion\\'s words, and the wonderful current that ran from his handsto hers.  Was this what had been meant, that truant afternoon, by thecalling birds, the leafing trees and the poignant air along theriver?  Was this what young women felt when lovers told their love?She could not have formulated the questions, but her heart askedthem, and Max, meanwhile, was repeating:\"I\\'ll get you avay from here!\"\"How--how could you do it?\" she gasped.\"It\\'d be dead easy.  If there\\'s any scrap, you vatch your chanc\\'t un\\'give the house the slip.  I\\'ll be vaitin\\' at the hotel till midnight.Delephone me from the nearest drugstore, un\\' ve\\'ll take a trolleydown the line un\\' catch a train to N\\'York un\\' be married there thissame nighd.  I\\'ve a friend who\\'s a minister un\\' vill get out of hisbed any hour I\\'d ask him.\"He pressed her hands tighter, and, as he leaned against the tree,drew her slightly toward him.But Mary, though she did not know why, still fearful, held back.\"I--we couldn\\'t do that,\" she said.\"Vhy not?\" he demanded.\"Because--why, we couldn\\'t go away together, alone: it wouldn\\'t beright.\"Max straightened suddenly.  He released her hands and placed onetight arm about her waist.\"It vould be righd if I _lofed_ you,\" he said.  \"Und I do lof you.Ve city folk, ve can\\'t do things slow-like you liddle town people.Vhen I saw you this morning, I knew I liked you, because you vas sodifferent from all these rubes around here; un\\' vhen I talk vith youthis efenin\\' I know I lof you.  Listen here: you come avay with meto-_nighd_.  Ve vill go righd ofer to N\\'York, un\\' there ve getmarried righd avay.  No more school, nor dishvashin\\', nor scoldin\\'.Your own fader vill be pleased vhen it\\'s ofer, because my fader isreech, un\\' my fader vill be pleased too, because he\\'s been devilin\\'me to marry for more\\'n a ye-ar, only I nefer till now found a girl I_lof_.  Come on, Mary: I lof you!\"Her eyes swam in a mist.  They had come then--love and freedom, handin hand.  Her soul grew faint within her.  She struggled a little,fluttering like a young bird in a capturing palm, but he drew hertighter, and his free hand passed electrically across her cheek.\"Come on avay!\" he urged softly.\"I--I don\\'t know what to do!\" she panted.  \"Wait--wait \"--it was theancient cry of womanhood upon the brink--\"wait till to-morrow!\"There was a step behind them, which Max was the first to hear.  Hefreed her, and they stood mute until the shadowy passer-by had gone.It was an incident that at least lessened the spell.\"Perhaps it\\'s all right,\" said Mary.  \"Perhaps Etta didn\\'t see me,an\\' I can tell \\'em I was over at my girl-friend\\'s.\"\"It\\'s only puttin\\' off vhat\\'s got to happen _some_time,\" Max argued.\"This town\\'s no place for a girl like you.\"He leaned toward her, but she drew, reluctantly, away.  What might bewell by day may well seem ill by night.\"Wait till to-morrow, anyhow,\" she urged.--But to-morrow, shewondered, how should she explain her afternoon away from school?Max considered.\"All righd,\" he at last nodded.  \"Go home un\\' think things ofer vithyourself; but I\\'ll be chust as ready to-morrow as I am to-day.You\\'ve got to get avay from all this ugliness.  Remember that, un\\'remember I hafn\\'t been _fresh_, un\\' I vant righd now to marry you.  Ihafn\\'t efen tried to kiss you.  Think of that, un\\' think that I\\'ll bevaitin\\' up at the hotel, in case of drouble, till _mid_nighd.\"He wheeled at that, and left her.Ten minutes later--at a quarter to seven, so rapidly had the dramaunrolled itself--she had reached home to find that Etta had beenthere before her.  Denbigh, on the early morning shift that week, wasalready in bed, but her mother tossed the truant into the parlor andlocked both doors while she went up stairs to waken him.He came down at once, in his nightshirt, roaring.  He turned the keyand flung wide the door.The room, however, was empty, and the window open.  Mary and Max werealready together, hurrying through the warm spring evening toward thetrolley-car that was to carry them on the first stage of theirjourney to New York.IIITHE SPECTER OF FEARA sixteen an angry and frightened girl running away from a home wherethe necessity for work must cheat her youth of its just rights--atsixteen such a girl cannot analyze her emotions, and Mary\\'s were insheer panic.  She had never before been farther from her own townthan the ten miles\\' distant county-seat, had never before been atmore than verbal odds with her parents.  Philadelphia had stood forthe City of Lanterns, and a quick retort for revolution.  Now she wasbound for New York and marriage.There was none of the few persons on the trolley-car that knew her,yet she kept her face to the window and away from them.  There was nochance of capture, yet she trembled whenever the brakes creaked and anew passenger came aboard.  It might, perhaps, be truly said that shedid not feel at all, and that the power of poignant realization wasstill paralyzed by her own action.  It was as if she had amputated aportion of her spiritual being, and wras still numb from the shock.Whatever Max\\'s own feelings, he at any rate conducted himself in themanner least calculated to rouse his companion.  He spoke only togive the few necessary directions, and then in a low tone, not facingher, but looking straight ahead.  He had slipped her the money to payher own fare and, the better to deceive whoever might follow them,had told her to buy a round-trip ticket to a point beyond that forwhich they were bound.  With his lemon-colored shoes planted upon hissuitcase, he sat beside her, but he kept as wide a space between themas the short seat would permit; and it was only under the discreetcovering of the light overcoat upon his knee that he kept a tight andreassuring grasp of her firm hand.At a mile from the county-town they left the car--Mary first and Maxtwenty yards behind--and then, for the competent young man seemed tohave prepared for everything, walked across the fields, under thestars, to a flag-station where, within a few minutes, they couldcatch a New York express.  Arm in arm they walked, but Max never oncefrightened her by a burst of affection, never once did more than toencourage her by plain statements of his loyalty and more ornatedescriptions of the life before her.\"You vill _like_ it,\" he concluded.  \"I know you vill be happy, Mary.\"Mary\\'s breath caught a little in her throat.\"Ye--yes,\" she answered.  \"Only, I can\\'t help thinking some aboutmom.\"\"Sure you can\\'t,\" Max immediately agreed.  \"You mustn\\'t led her vorrylonger than you can help it.  I tell you vhat ve\\'ll do.  Ofer here inthe station, you wride her a letter und I\\'ll haf it mailed.\"\"Oh, but then pop would see it, an\\' he might follow us!\"\"Don\\' gif no names or say vhere ve\\'re goin\\', und how can he?  By thetime he gets it, ve\\'ll be safe married, anyways.  Here ve are at thestation.  I\\'ve got some paper un\\' pencil und an envellup: I\\'ll tellyou chust vhat to wride.\"He did tell her, and this note, given to the train-porter, was mailedfarther along the line:\"_Dear Mother_: Don\\'t please worry about me.  I will soon be back fora visit, only I have gone to Buffalo to get married.  He is a niceyoung man and his father is rich, for I could not stand to have Popbeat me, nor do other people\\'s work any more.  \"Your aff. daughter,        \"MARY DENBIGH.\"The train, which Max had duly signaled, had stopped just as thewriting was ended, and the pair of runaways had hurried into the lastseat of the rear car.During the journey that followed, Mary\\'s nerves, accustomed to earlyhours, gave way not to tears, but to the exhaustion consequent uponthe strain of her crowded day.  Her hat in her lap, her russet hairmade a pillow for her against the sharp window-sill, and, with Max\\'scoat piled at the pane to protect her from the keen arrows of theinrushing night air, she lay back, the pink cheeks and the red mouthpaler than an hour since, and the blue eyes closed.  She did not seemto sleep, and yet it was in a dream that the ride ended, in a dreamthat she found herself one of a hurrying crowd stamping down theplatform and into the huge elevator at the Jersey City station, in adream that she clung faithfully to Max\\'s arm as the sudden lights anddamp odors struck her and as she dropped upon a straw-covered benchof a swaying car, which shot them immediately through a tunneleddarkness into the very depths of the earth.She knew from her geography that New York was separated from NewJersey by water.\"When do we cross the ferry, Max?\" she asked.Max smiled, his thin lips showing his white teeth in sharp contrastto his olive skin.\"We\\'re crossing it now,\" he answered.\"But where\\'s the water?\"Max, mopping his dark forehead with a purple-bordered handkerchief,pointed to the roof of the car.\"Up there,\" he said.  \"Ve\\'re in the tube, you know.\"She did not know, but she was too much ashamed of her rural ignorancefurther to discover it by unconsidered questions, and so full of apulsing wonder at what was to come next, so full of the expectationof the child at her first melodrama that she had place for nobackward thought.  She sat silent until they had come out of thetunnel, climbed a windy stair, and emerged upon a thoroughfare asmuch ablaze as if all the stars of heaven had descended to light it,and as brimming with moving life as her father\\'s mill at ten o\\'clockin the morning.Max regarded the girl\\'s open-eyed wonder.\"Now,\" he said, \"ve\\'ll chust chump in a taxi un\\' go get a goodsupper, un\\' then, vhile the vaiter\\'s filling our order, I\\'ll first doa little delephoning.\"He put up his dark hand; a passing automobile, its tin flag raised,hummed up to the curb, and Mary, clinging timidly to the arm of herbetrothed, began her first ride in a taxicab.The street--it was Fourteenth Street, he told her--flared and seethedand spluttered before them.  As if leaning over the head of a runawayhorse, they shot in and out among clanging cable-cars, dashed bysnorting vehicles of their own sort, and nearly grazed jostling cabsdriven by cursing Jehus.  Even at that late hour, some of the shopswere still open, and the wide pavements on either side were blackwith countermarching processions of people, moving with the steadyrapidity and stolidity of a swarm of ants.  When the street ran by atree-sprinkled square, its houses seemed to burst into still greaterbrightness to atone for the darkness of the park.  Every secondbuilding was a restaurant, a theater for moving-pictures, or asaloon.  Their electric-signs now winked from nothingness to light,now flashed forth a word, one letter at a time, and now weresurrounded with wriggling snakes of fire.It came upon her--this vision of the absolutely new, of the city\\'simmensity and teeming life--at a moment when her heart was ready forreaction, when memory was prepared to reassert itself, and when,anger gone and regret poised like a runner at the starting-line, herquick determination might have failed her.  But it came withstupefying force.  The dream of pleasure gave place for the moment toa certainty of dread.  Vaguely, unreasoningly, but with theunquestioning acceptance of a child, she felt New York as a terrible,solidified unity; as a vast, malevolent consciousness; as a livingprison that implacably and resistlessly raised itself on every handand on every hand shut her in forever.She trembled and clung the tighter to her companion\\'s arm, and hercompanion was alert to note her agitation.\"Vhat\\'s the matter?\" he inquired, in a voice that he well meant to betender.\"I--I don\\'t know,\" she began, her red underlip indrawn.  \"I--aren\\'twe goin\\' pretty fast?\"\"Who?  Us?  Vhy, I was chust thinking I\\'d tell him to hit up the pacea little.  Are you scared?\"Her pride would not permit confession.\"Oh, no,\" she lied; \"I\\'m not scared.\"\"But you are shivering.\"\"I guess I\\'m kind of chilly.\"\"All righd.  Chust vait a minute un\\' ve\\'ll soon be at the restaurantun\\' varm up.  You\\'ll like that restaurant: it\\'s von of the swellestin town.\"\"But it\\'s pretty late,\" she ventured.  \"Your friend--are you surehe----\"\"Who?  The minister?\"  Max patted her hand with reassuring affection.\"Don\\'t you vorry about him.  He\\'s all for me, und I\\'ll get him out ofbed chust as soon as ve\\'ve ordered our supper.\"A few blocks more, and Max, aided by a marvelously tall person in awonderful uniform, was helping her, with what she considered anelaborate courtesy, to dismount from the taxi, pass under a glassawning and, through a changing stream of hurrying waiters andarriving and departing guests terribly arrayed, to climb a softlycarpeted stair and enter a brilliant balcony open to the street andfull of chattering men and women eating and drinking at a score oftables.  Even in her fright, it was with a touch of admiration thatshe observed how Max--her Max--seemed to be known to the immediatelyattentive waiters, and how, smiling, they hurried to make way for him.They secured a corner table, a relatively quiet corner table, andthere, with a servant standing by, pencil in hand, and with a hugedouble-paged menu-card before each of them, made ready for their meal.\"Chust you order vhatever you like,\" said Max.  \"Pretty neareverything in the vorld\\'s on there, but if you vant anything that youcan\\'t see, chust you ask for it.\"Mary looked at the card.  In spite of all that had passed, and allthat now filled her heart, she was young, and youth is so fortunateas to be able to eat in the trough of any emotional sea.  She was achild, and, by the sure logic of childhood, who-so thought to feedher could be nothing but a friend.The card, however, was of small assistance.  Its very size wasappalling, and its offerings were made in an unfamiliar tongue.\"You get what you like,\" she at last submitted.  \"I\\'m so hungry I caneat anything.\"He saw her difficulty so well that he could rescue her from itwithout seeming to see it at all.\"Vell, I\\'m vith you there,\" he said cheerfully, and proceeded to obeyher, rattling off a list of dishes of no one of which she had everheard before.  \"Un\\' have the Martinis dry,\" he cautioned inconclusion, \"vith a dash of absinthe in them--un\\' bring them righdavay: I\\'m spittin\\' gotten.\"The waiter left, and, as he did so, Max again addressed the girl.\"Excuse me for von minute,\" he said.But Mary\\'s blue eyes opened wide in instant alarm, and she put adetaining hand upon his wrist.\"Don\\'t!\" she quavered.  \"Don\\'t go away!  I--I don\\'t want to be leftalone.\"Max laughed outright.\"Haf you forgot our minister?\" he demanded.  \"Ve don\\'t vant to go tohis house vithout first giffin\\' him a chanc\\'t to get some _clothes_on.  Efen up your vay, the ministers vear a suit under theirnighd-gowns vhen they marry people.\"She smiled faintly at his labored wit, and, as her heart fluttered atthis definite approach to the end of her journey, permitted him to go.Had he been absent for only the minute that he had promised, the timewould have seemed long to the waiting girl, but he remained invisiblefor much longer, and to Mary, watching the laughing, uncaringstrangers from another life, the terror of the city in her soul andthe sense of all that she had done lurking in the shadows of herbrain, the quarter of an hour appeared to be four times that period.Once she feared that he had met with some accident; once she wassaved from starting in search of him only by the knowledge that, inso doing, she must infallibly lose herself.  She would have madeinquiries of a waiter, but the waiters were too imposing.  She wouldhave cried, but she was afraid to cry.  She would have ended,perhaps, by some utter betrayal of all that was battling within her;but, just when she was sure, for the thousandth time, that she couldendure no more, she saw Max coming toward her from the long-watcheddoor.As soon as she noticed his strangely stern face, the old fear gaveplace to a fresh one.\"What\\'s happened?\" she asked.He pulled back his chair spitefully and flung himself into it.\"These crazy laws of your America,\" he snarled, \"there ain\\'t no sensein them!\"\"What\\'s the matter?\" she repeated.\"Vhy, it\\'s this way.  Of course, it don\\' make no difference; it onlyputs things off till _mor_nin\\'; but it\\'s this vay: I got my ministerfriend on the \\'phone, un\\' he\\'s all ready to marry us, only he saysthe law says ve must haf a license from City Hall first, un\\' if vedon\\'t get von, he can go to chail because of marryin\\' us vith_out_it.\"\"Well,\" said Mary, \"let\\'s get a license.\"Max spread forward the palms of his dark hands.\"How can ve?\" he demanded.  \"The City Hall closes in the afternoonun\\' don\\'t open till _mor_nin\\'.\"Here, apparently, was tragedy.  Specific reasons for its tragicelements the girl would, perhaps, have found it hard to give, butthat it was tragic she knew instinctively.  Her blue eyes opened widein fright.\"What are we to do?\" she pleaded.But Max, the resourceful, had been, it appeared, only temporarilycheckmated.\"I thought of that,\" he said.  \"Ve can\\'t get married now tillto-morrow; but my modder has a good friend un\\' I delephone _her_.She told me she\\'d be glad to have you her guest ofer to-nighd.  I\\'lltake you there in a taxi, un\\' go home for my own sleep.  I\\'d take youvith me, but it vouldn\\'t do to spring a new vife on the familyvithout varnin\\'.  Then I\\'ll have talked vith my own people, und I\\'llbring them around to the veddin\\', first thing in the mornin\\'.\"Mary, however, quailed.\"I don\\'t want to do that,\" she inconsequently responded.  \"I don\\'twant to go to strange people\\'s alone.\"\"Oh, don\\'t you vorry, now,\" Max soothed her.  \"I\\'ll go vith you for aliddle vhile un\\' see that you make yourself at home.  This friend ofmy modder\\'s is a fine voman, un\\' she\\'s _rich_.  She is Mrs. Légère.She lives in a fine house: you\\'ll like her.\"He persisted in his persuasions, and, in the end, he won heracquiescence.  After all, here were the walls of the city about her,and she had no choice.While they had been talking, the waiter had returned and had placedbefore each of them one of the stemmed glasses full of the paleyellow concoction that Max had ordered.\"Vell,\" grinned the host, \"here\\'s happy returns of the day un\\' many_of_ them.\"He took his glass in his hairy hand and flung the contents down histhroat.But Mary looked at the drink in growing alarm.\"Isn\\'t it whiskey?\" she asked.\"No-o-o!  I don\\'t drink vhiskey.  This is only vermout\\' un\\' tchin.\"\"Gin\\'s just the same as whiskey,\" the girl protested.\"Not by a long sighd it ain\\'t.\"\"It\\'s liquor, anyhow.\"\"Sure, it\\'s liquor; but drink a liddle of it; it vill gif you anappetite.\"Mary shook her russet head.\"I don\\'t need no appetite,\" she said; \"I\\'m half starved as it is.\"\"You\\'ll need something to grind up these here Hungarian things,though.\"\"No,\" said Mary; \"I\\'d rather not.\"\"But efferybody does here in New York.\"\"Then I guess I\\'ll wait till I\\'m a regular New Yorker.\"\"Don\\'t your fader drink?\"\"Sometimes he does,\" said the girl, conclusively; \"an\\' that\\'s why Idon\\'t.\"He urged her no further; he even denied himself a glass of the winethat he had ordered, and he succeeded, by this abstinence, inregaining whatever he had lost of her faith in him.  He ate heartilyhimself, and if his manner of eating was not precisely that mostcommon in restaurants of a more careful sort, this was something thatthe girl would have failed to note even had she not been so busilyengaged by wonder at the service and consumption of the novel food.It was not until, contentedly sighing, she had sunk back from thewreck of her second ice, that she remembered again the lateness ofthe hour.With a display of his large bills and another flurry of attendants,they left the restaurant, walking among the gayly dressed and loudlylaughing people at the tables, passing down the heavily carpetedstairs, and entering another pulsing motor-car.  Max leaned out ofthe door and gave an address that Mary did not hear; the chauffeurthrew forward the metal clutch, and the automobile shot ahead on itsjourney.They went for some time under the still hammering elevated; thenturned through a quieter and darker street; threaded rapidly,twisting hither and yon, a dozen other highways and byways and atlength drew up at their destination.  Max leaped lightly to thepavement and tossed the driver a bill.\"Neffer mind the change,\" he said, and had scarcely helped Mary todismount before the car had snorted away into the night, leaving thepair of young lovers in the scarcely broken darkness and in a silencethat seemed surrounded by a dim, distant rumble of city-sound.The girl could see little of her whereabouts.  She observed only thatshe was in a slumbering block of blinded dwelling-houses, a scenedifferent from any that New York had thus far presented to her.  Onedistant, sputtering arc-light succeeded only in accentuating thegloom; underfoot the way resounded to the slightest tread; from thelittle patch of inky sky into which the roofs blended above, a barehandful of anæmic stars twinkled drowsily, and, on both sides, fromcorner to corner, the uniform, narrow houses rose in somberrepetition, each with its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each withits blank windows, each seemingly asleep behind its mask.More than this, indeed, Mary\\'s tired eyes could have had no time toobserve, for Max\\'s strong fingers were at once curled under herarmpit, and she was hurried up to one of the innumerable mutedoorways.  He pressed a button hidden somewhere in the wall, and,almost immediately, the door swung open.The pair looked from darkness upon a rosy twilight.  Under the feeblerays of the pink-shadowed stairway, there were just visible theoutlines of a full-blown form.\"Hello, Rosie!\" cried Max as, quickly snapping the door behind him,he passed by his charge and seized an invisible hand.  \"You vaited upfor us un\\' come to the door yourself!  That vas good of you.\"In spite of her Gallic cognomen, Mrs. Rose Légère replied in the toneand vernacular of Manhattan Island.\"Sure I waited for you,\" she answered.  \"But don\\'t talk so loud:you\\'ll wake the whole family.--And is this the little lady, eh?\"Half disposed to resist, Mary felt herself gently propelled forwardby Max, and then enveloped in an ample, strangely perfumed embrace,while two full warm lips printed a kiss upon her cool young cheek.\"Come into the back parlor,\" said Rose Légère, lightly seizing thegirl\\'s hand.  \"I want to get a look at the bride.\"She led the way past the closed double doors of the front room on theground floor, and into a rear apartment that, though not brilliantlyilluminated, was far better lighted than the hall.It was a room the like of which Mary had never seen, decorated incolors that outshone the rainbow and filled to overflowing withfurniture that, to the undiscriminating eyes of the girl, gave it theair of a chamber in the Cave of Monte Cristo.  Gilt-framed picturesof beautiful men and women--she supposed they must be Grecian men andwomen--flamed, in more than lifelike hues, from the crimson walls.The tall lamp on the blue-clothed table was shaded in red; the thickrug flowered gorgeously; the deep chairs were upholstered in palebrown, and the lazy sofa on which, as Max closed the inner door upontheir entrance, Mrs. Légère seated herself with her guest, wasstuffed with soft pillows of bewildering radiance.Nor, when Mary came to look at her, did the hostess seem out ofkeeping with her surroundings.  To the girl\\'s home Owen Denbigh hadonce brought a large, lithographed calendar, issued by a brewery, anddepicting, at its top, a woman of the elder Teutonic days, very redand white, with long yellow hair, and a body of rounded proportions,which threatened to grind to powder the rock on which she sat, anddesperately endangered the filmy garments that enfolded withoutclothing her.  It was of this picture that Mary instantly thoughtwhen she got her first full view of Mrs. Légère.The hostess was clad in a long, fluttering, baby-blue kimona, spottedby embroidered white dragons, with sleeves that fell despairinglyfrom her puckered elbows, disclosing thick white arms with rolls offat at the wrists, and plump hands and fingers the almond shapednails of which gleamed like the points of daggers.  The folds oflight silk, held by a large amethyst pin at the base of her sturdythroat, bulged broadly over her capacious breasts and trailed, acrossfrou-frouing lace, far beyond her heels.All this Mary saw first, and then, looking upward across the figurethat, literally, overshadowed her, she saw a large, round,good-enough-natured face, surmounting a white double chin.  Thecorn-colored hair was massed in an intricate maze of puffs and coilsand braids, which made the girl wonder how much was its owner\\'snatural growth and how much was due to the artifices that Mary hadalways longed for and had always been denied.  The forehead was lowand calm; the violet eyes of a more than natural brightness, withcrowsfeet beside them and pouches below, only just discernible inlamplight.  The brows and lashes were of a blackness that contrastedwith the coiffure; the skin, here like snow and there as red asroses, and the full, easy-going mouth as crimson as a wound.  Marythought that here at last was a beautiful woman.\"I sure am glad to see you,\" purred Mrs. Légère, as, having divestedthe guest of hat and coat, she whisked these into the hall and,returning, again seated herself and fondled the visitor\\'s passive,but flattered, hand between her own extensive, well-cared-for palms.\"Max raved about you over the telephone--just raved--and, now that Iget to a clinch with you, I begin to think that he knew what he wastalking about.\"Max was seating himself on an orange-colored ottoman opposite them.He grinned broadly, his narrowed lips showing his even, sparklingteeth.\"Sure I knew vhat I vas talkin\\' about,\" he declared.Mary was not used to compliments, but she was too honest not to showthat she liked them.  She blushed, and was all the prettier for it;but she did manage to deprecate the sentiments of the better known ofher critics.\"Mr. Grossman is crazy,\" she modestly observed.\"About you he is,\" said Mrs. Légère; \"and,\" she added, \"I doo\\'t blamehim.--But look here\"--she placed a crooked forefinger under thegirl\\'s chin and turned the blushing face upward--\"look here, what atired little woman it is!--Max, you\\'re so careless, I\\'ll bet you\\'venever thought to give this poor child a drop of wine to strengthenher after all that traveling!\"\"I tried to get her to,\" said Max, \"but she vouldn\\'t take it.\"\"What?\"\"I don\\'t drink,\" explained Mary.\"Of course you don\\'t, but,\" Mrs. Légère elucidated, \"taking a glassor two of wine after a railroad ride isn\\'t drinking.\"\"No-o,\" Mary granted; \"but I don\\'t care for it.\"\"I hope not--only taken this way it\\'s medicine.  I don\\'t blame youfor not drinking in a restaurant with a bad boy like Max; but youneed it now; you\\'re all played out.  This is as good as your hometill to-morrow, you know.  Just have a little with me; I\\'m old enoughto be your mother, and we won\\'t give Max a drop--just to punishhim.--Cassie!\"She had run through the speech with a rapidity that had left the girlno chance for reply, and now, before Mary could move her lips, shehad, with amazing agility, leaped to a back door, opened it, calledan order into the darkness beyond, and as quickly returned to herformer position on the sofa.\"It will be the best thing in the world for you,\" she said.  \"Thedoctor orders it for me, and so I always have it ready on ice.\"As she concluded speaking, the door through which she had called wasreopened and there entered a tall, raw-boned, glum, colored girl,whose shining ebony skin was darkened by the white apron that shewore.  She bore a tray on which was a gilt-topped bottle and twonarrow glasses.\"Put it there, Cassie,\" said Mrs. Légère, pointing to the table.The girl obeyed and left the room.  Max seized the bottle, ripped offthe gilding and, wrapping his purple-bordered handkerchief about theneck, with one dexterous twist, drew out the resounding cork.A living foam gushed from the neck as the self-appointed butlerpoured into the two glasses a pale gold fluid, which creamed angrilyto their edges, and then subsided until first one addition and thenanother set them boiling again.Mrs. Légère took a glass in each hand and pressed the foremost intothe passive palm of the girl.\"Well,\" said she, in a phrase new to Mary, \"here we are.\"Mary hesitated, the glass to her lips.  She could hear the liquidwhispering to her, and particles seemed to jump from it and sting hereyes.\"What is it?\" she asked.\"Vine,\" said Max.\"But what kind of wine?\" she weakly delayed.\"My dear,\" her entertainer informed her, \"there is only one kind ofwine in New York.\"\"It\\'s tchampagne,\" hissed Max, as if the name were something toosacred to be spoken in the tone of ordinary conversation.  \"Un\\' thiskind costs eighd dollars a bottle.\"The words and the connotation had their lure.  Champagne--she hadheard of it as the beverage of the rich; and eight dollars for onebottle--the price of two winter dresses!\"Come on,\" smiled Mrs. Légère.The girl still hesitated.\"Here\\'s to the wedding!\" prompted the hostess, and drank the entirecontents of her glass.Mary took a mouthful and swallowed it.  At first she nearly choked.Then the fiery liquid brought fresh tears to her blue eyes, stillsmarting from the gas that had, a moment before, assailed them.  Butfinally, there began to spread through her weary body a gratefulglow, and, half in apology for what she feared had been a clownishexhibition, she looked up with red lips pleasantly parted.\"Now, wasn\\'t I right?\" inquired Mrs. Légère.  \"Don\\'t you feel betteralready?\"\"I--I believe I do, thank you,\" Mary admitted.  \"Anyhow, it is prettygood, I guess--when you get used to it.\"She took, bravely and with an ease now gained by experience, a seconddrink, and, as she held the glass before her, Max gallantlyreplenished it.A bell rang and the glum, ebony maid passed through the room, closingboth doors behind her.Mary, alarmed at this nocturnal interruption, started a little, butneither of her companions seemed to regard the incident as unusual.\"You look much better,\" Mrs. Légère asseverated.  \"Finish that glass,dearie, and you\\'ll be all to the good again.\"\"Do you think I\\'d better take so much?\"Both Max and Mrs. Légère laughed unaffectedly.\"Vhy, there ain\\'t enough here to hurt a baby,\" declared the former.Mary accepted the assurance.  She did not like the taste of thechampagne, but she knew now that she had been very tired, and thewine sent fresh life and energy through her sleepy limbs.  Sheemptied the glass and felt, joyfully, all her fears and regretsslipping for her.  Doubt and difficulty were resolved into ashimmering mist, were overcome, were forgotten.The black maid thrust her head in at the hall-doorway.Mrs. Légère rose.\"Excuse me,\" she said, leaving the room.  \"I\\'ll be right back.\"Max, the instant she was gone, rose in his turn.\"I\\'m going to fool her,\" he said.  \"I\\'m going to graft her drink!\"He took the glass that his hostess had placed upon the table, pouredmore of the wine into it, replenished the glass of his nowunresisting companion and sat down by her side, his arm stretchedbehind her.Mary, with refreshed courage, broke the silence.  She was feelinglike a naughty child triumphantly successful in her naughtiness.\"Do you know, Max,\" she said, \"I gave a jump when that bell rang?  Ithought for a minute they might be after us.\"\"Nix on that,\" chuckled Max.  \"They couldn\\'t catch us if they tried.Here\\'s to the runavays!\"They clinked glasses and drank.\"I guess,\" the young man pursued, \"it was chust von of Rosie\\'sboarders.\"\"Her boarders?  Does she run a boarding-house?\"  There was a note ofdignified scorn in Mary\\'s climbing voice.\"Sure she keeps boarders.\"\"But I----\"  Mary hesitated.  She was tasting wine for the first timein her life, she had been tired and nerve-wracked, and now, thoughthoughts danced through her mind with unfamiliar rapidity, utteranceseemed to her suddenly, and somewhat amusingly, to have become tooclumsy to keep pace with them.  \"I thought,\" she elaboratelypersisted, \"that--you--said--she--was rich.\"\"She is,\" said Max; \"only she\\'s got a big house she can\\'t all useherself.  Lots of people fill their houses that vay in N\\'York.\"Mary started to formulate a reply that came glistening along the dimhorizon of her mind; but just then there was a light tap at the door.\"Come in!\" called Max, and Mrs. Légère re-entered.The precaution of her hostess forced a smile from Mary.\"Why did you knock?\" she asked.But Mrs. Légère shook her corn-colored locks wisely.\"I don\\'t ever disturb lovers,\" she said.She sat down opposite the pair she was addressing and, withoutnoticing that Max had appropriated her glass, discovered a fresh oneon the mantelpiece, poured herself a mouthful of the wine and thendecanted the rest for Mary.She had just put down the empty bottle when the bell rang a secondtime.\"Good Lord,\" she sighed, \"there it goes again!  These people will bethe death of me, losing their keys and coming in at all hours.  Nevermind, Cassie,\" she called through the rear door, \"I\\'ll go myself!\"And then, to Mary, she concluded: \"I\\'ll attend to this and then I\\'llcome right back and send Max home and show you to your room.\"She left them seated on the sofa, Max\\'s dark hand encircling thesoft, young fingers of the girl as gently as if he had been a rusticwooer.\"Shall I go graft another bottle from the _kit_chen?\" he asked,grinning impishly.Mary shook her russet head.\"Not for me,\" she said; \"I guess I\\'ve had enough.\"Max again refrained from insistence.  Instead, he remained besideher, and fell once more into the story that she had learned best tolike,--the beautiful pictures of the wonderful city, of the work-freelife that she should lead there, and of their marriage on the fastapproaching morning.Gradually, as his voice ran smoothly on, the words he was then sayingbecame confused in her brain with other words that he had saidearlier in the evening.  Her eyelids grew heavy.  The mood ofexhilaration passed, and a weariness far more compelling than thatfrom which she had previously suffered stole upon her.  Mrs. Légèrewas absent for an unconscionable time.  The girl yawned.\"I wonder when she\\'s comin\\' back,\" said Mary, \"I\\'m--I\\'m awful tired.\"Max\\'s hand slipped to her unresisting head and pressed it down uponhis shoulder.  He had not yet so much as kissed her, and he did notkiss her now.\"Don\\'t vorry about her,\" he said softly.  \"You\\'re tired out.  Chustclose your eyes for a minute, Mary, un\\' I\\'ll vake you vhen she comes.\"His shoulder was very comfortable.  She closed her blue eyes.\"You will wake me?\" she murmured.\"Sure I vill,\" said Max.  \"I\\'ll have you clean avake before she\\'sthrough knockin\\'.\"But he must have forgotten that promise, for when Mrs. Légère at lastreturned, he was still sitting there among the pillows, Mary\\'s hairfallen over his green coat, her cheeks pinker than ever, and hergirlish breast rising and falling rhythmically in sleep.IVAWAKENINGClinging to a gigantic pendulum, Mary was swept through a mightycurve of roaring darkness, up from the black chasm of insensibility,and tossed, swaying over that frightful cliff, to the precipitouscrag of consciousness.  For what seemed many minutes, she tottered onthe verge, dizzy, afraid.  Then white knives, swift and sharp,slashed at her eyes and forced up the lids.Defying closed blinds and drawn chintz curtains, the sunlight ofnoonday beat upon her face.  She pulled something between her cheekand the leaping rays.  Her hand trembled.At first she could neither think nor recollect.  The blows of an ax,regular, tremendous, were splitting her head.  Her throat was hot anddry and choking.  Her stomach crawled and leaped with nausea.  Fromhead to foot she was shaking with recurrent nervous chills thatwracked a body of which every muscle was strained and sore.Realization of the present came slowly, but it preceded all memory ofthe past.  She found that the thing with which she had instinctivelyshaded her eyes was a sheet, and, as she lowered it, she saw, in aglance where the employment of sight was a separate pain, that shewas lying among large pillows in a big brass bed, heavily mattressed.Beyond the foot of the bed her survey could not extend, because thefoot was high and hung with a pink and green down quilt; but betweentwo windows against the wall to her right, she saw a bureau, bearinga few scant toilet articles, and opposite, on the left, there was awashstand with a basin on the floor before it and, on its top, apitcher, a soap-tray, a small brown bottle, and a little blue boxbursting with white cotton.This was not the room in which she had first fallen asleep.With that isolated fact flashing like a message of disaster throughher brain, she sat suddenly upright in the bed; but the room pitchedbefore her like a boat in the trough of a storm on the river at home.A wave of sickness hissed over her, and she sank back among pillowsrepellantly scented.Vaguely she realized that she must be in a room somewhere above theground floor.  Dimly she began to wonder how she had got up thestairs.  What would the kindly Mrs. Légère think of her condition?And that which had happened--had it lasted for an hour or a night?That which had happened--there memory, in a blinding blast,reasserted itself.  What had been but half-wittingly accepted was nowwholly known.  Hot irons were branding upon her brain the fullhistory of all that had occurred: the deeds for which she had at lastlearned the name, and the deeds that, even in her own frightenedsoul, were nameless.  There was nothing--nothing of her, hand andfoot, and mouth and eye and soul--that was not defiled.For herself, for Max, but most of all for the hideous facts of life,she shook in physical disgust.  Before the face of such things, whatmust birth and marriage mean?  She opened her eyes, but she could notlook at her silent witnesses; she shut her lids, but she saw, behindthem, the hairy arms of a gorilla closing on her, to break her andbear her away.  For one moment, all that she had loved she hated, andfor the next, seizing his smiling reassurance as the one vow thatcould legalize what nothing could refine, all that she had come tohate she tried to force herself to love.She understood now so much that she had never understood before: thewhispered words of town gossip, the stray glimpses of lovers in thesummer lanes, the cautions and the commands that had once so galledher in her home.At the word, her mind swung back to far-away yesterday.  She wassorry that she had been the cause--for she had been the cause--of thespilling of the stew.  She was sorry that she had been so sharp withSallie.  She wished that she had washed the dishes less unwillingly.She still feared--she more than ever feared--the swaying bulk ofmasculinity that had been her father, but she began to see in him thelogical result of forces that were themselves, as yet, beyond herken; and she looked with a new and pitying vision upon the picture ofher little, work-worn and care-marked mother stooping over thepolished kitchen-stove.Her breast tossed and her throat throbbed; but she was beyond tears.Painfully, slowly, yet with resolution, she struggled back to hersitting-posture in the bed.In this position she found herself facing a long mirror hung againstthe opposite wall, and in the mirror she saw what was herself.  Witha low cry, she pulled loose the sheet and covered her nakedness.That done, she looked again at the strange face that fronted her: aface the more strange because it was the intimate become alien, aruin, an accusation.  Framed in a tangle of dank hair, the cheeks,once pink, were chalky now, and splotched with red, the mouth thatshe had known only as full and firm, was loose and twisted; the eyesthat had been blue, now circled with black, burned in blood-shotfields like coals of angry fire.One impulse alone directed her: to find her clothes; to put them on;to return, as far as the mask of appearances would take her, to theself that she had been.  In spite of aching head and quivering hands,she wrapped the sheet about her and, with infinite care, got from thebed.  The floor seemed to sweep up to meet her, but she steadiedherself against the wall and, each timid stride a separate agony,began to stumble about the room.She looked for a clothes-closet or wardrobe, but there was neither.The only door was the door of exit, and the nearest chair was empty.In a corner she saw a pile of linen: laboriously she stooped andpicked it up, unrolled a portion, and then, gasping in horror, tossedit away.  On the other chair there lay a long kimona of crimson.  Shelifted it and found, neatly arranged below, a sheer cambric garmentedged with coarse lace, two black silk stockings slashed with red,and a pair of slippers, high-heeled, with buckles of brass--for noreason that she could have formulated, the sight sickened her.  Shewent to the bureau and tugged at its drawers, but all that she foundwas a single brown bottle, like that she had first observed on thewashstand, filled with white tablets and labeled \"Poison.\"Obviously, her clothes had been taken from the room.In a panic of shame, she groped blindly for the door: she must callfor Mrs. Légère.  She grasped the knob and turned it--the door waslocked.Fear, mad and unreasoning, drove its spurs into her sides.Forgetting her nausea, heedless of her pain, she ran first to onewindow and then to the other, but the bowed shutters, though theyadmitted the light, would open for nothing beside: they were fastenedwith riveted loops of brass, and, looking through the small spacebetween them, she could catch only a glimpse of the street far below.She tried to argue that the key might have fallen from the lockwithin the room, but she could not find it, and, the sheet droppingfrom her shoulders, she began to rattle at the knob, and then topound upon the panels, her voice rising swiftly from a low call to ahigh, hysterical, frantic cry for help.\"Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!\" she cried, and then assuddenly ceased, tilted against the door, and collapsed into a nakedheap upon the floor.All power of movement seemed to have slipped from her, but when therecame a heavy footfall on the stair, a swish of skirts outside and theloud rasping of a key inserted in the lock, Mary leaped galvanicallyto her feet, gathered the sheet about her body, and flung herselfupon the bed.The door opened and closed behind Rose Légère, who promptly relockedit and slipped the key into the swelling bosom but half concealed byher dragon-spotted, baby-blue negligé.\"What in hell\\'s the matter with _you_?\" she demanded.A little more rotund of figure, a little looser in the cheeks, andmore patently crayoned and powdered about the eyes, a little moreobviously painted and a little older, she was still the woman of thebrewery\\'s advertisement.  But her forehead was knotted in deep, angrywrinkles; her under jaw was thrust so far forward that the roll offat beneath it was invisible, and her eyes snapped with malice.Mary shrank back among the pillows.\"Weren\\'t you yellin\\'?\" persisted Rose.  \"Did you lose your voicedoin\\' it?  What in the hell\\'s the matter with you, I say?\"With a sweep of her stout arm, she seized the girl\\'s bare shoulderand shook it till Mary\\'s teeth clicked like castanets.\"I\\'m not goin\\' to have any such racket in my house!\" the womanasseverated, as she plied her punishment.  \"You\\'ve got to learnfirst-off to keep your mouth to yourself, and be dead sure if youdon\\'t I\\'ll give you a real beatin\\'.\"She tossed Mary from her, as if her victim had been a bundle ofstraw, and stood up again, arms akimbo, breathing scarcely beyond hernormal speed.Mary was half mad and wholly sick with dread.  She wanted to cry outfor rescue and dared not.  She wanted to rise and try to force thedoor or break open the shutters, but she could not move.  She couldonly lie there panting for breath, with her mouth gasping and herheart hammering at her breast.  She had closed her eyes.  She openedthem just in time to see Rose, whose slippered foot had touchedsomething on the floor, stoop, pick up, and place beside the key inher bosom, a crumpled purple-bordered handkerchief.\"Now then,\" said the woman in a tone that, if still hard, was atleast less intense than its predecessor, \"try to tell me what\\'s thetrouble, like somebody this side of Matteawan.\"With a supreme lunge at courage, Mary got her voice.\"I want my clothes,\" she said dully.  \"And where\\'s Max?\"\"Your clothes ain\\'t fit to wear,\" said Rose; \"an\\' I don\\'t know whereMax is.  What you need is breakfast.\"\"I want my clothes,\" monotonously repeated Mary.  \"I couldn\\'t eat tosave my life.  Hasn\\'t Max come back?\"But Rose did not seem to hear the question.\"Nonsense, honey,\" she said, her anger seeming now entirely passed.\"Of course you must eat.  I got up on purpose for it, and I\\'ve setthat nigger cooking a perfect peach of a breakfast.\"\"I want my clothes.\"Rose leaned over the bed and put a soothing hand upon herquestioner\\'s fevered forehead.\"Now don\\'t lose your nerve, dearie,\" she advised.  \"I\\'m yourfriend--honest, I am.  You rest awhile and eat a little, and thenmaybe we\\'ll talk things over.\"\"He hasn\\'t come yet?\"\"No, he hasn\\'t.  But why are you lettin\\' that jar you?  Perhaps he\\'ssick, too.  Perhaps he\\'s had some kind of a scrap with his old man.How do I know what\\'s hit him?  He\\'ll show up all right in the endand, till he does show up, you just make yourself at home here anddon\\'t bother.  I\\'ll take care of you.\"Something in the woman\\'s solicitude--or it may have been the quickand unexplained change from violence to tenderness--frightened Maryeven more than the initial outburst had frightened her.\"I want to go home,\" she quavered.\"Sure you want to go home,\" Rose acquiesced, without moving a muscle.\"But how can you go?  Max told me you\\'d sent your people a notesaying you\\'d hiked out with him to be married, and how can you gohome until he gets back here and you can take him along and show thegoods?\"Her tone was lightly argumentative, but it was also stolidlymerciless, and it hurled true to its mark the shaft of conviction.Out of the yesterday, Mary heard the voice of her father that was thevoice of a society rigidly shaped by the conditions of its ownfashioning:\"Bay \\'un thirty year old an\\' noot another sin ag\\'in \\'un, I would beat\\'un within a bare inch o\\' \\'er deeth, an\\' turn \\'un oot to live thelife \\'un had picked fur herself!\"She understood that statement now.\"I can go to Max\\'s,\" she hazarded.\"To--_where_?\"\"To Max\\'s father\\'s.\"\"Maybe you can; but it\\'s a long trip to Hungary.\"Mary answered nothing.  Rose had only confirmed what the girl had foran hour feared.\"You see how it is,\" pursued Rose, reading Mary\\'s silence with apracticed mind.  \"Better let me take care of you.\"Mary\\'s face was hidden.  Again she felt New York as a malevolentconsciousness, a living prison implacably raising around her itsinsurmountable walls.  There was, she thought, nothing left her butthe diminishing hope of Max\\'s return.\"Now you will eat, won\\'t you?\" Rose was continuing.Mary shook her head.Rose patted quietly one of the clenched hands that lay close to her.\"Better do it, dearie,\" she said.  \"I\\'m your friend; remember that.You can have whatever you want.\"Mary mastered what strength remained to her.  She raised herself onher elbow.\"Then let me go!\" she pleaded, extending an open palm like a beggarasking for a crust.  \"I don\\'t care if my clothes is mussed.  I don\\'tcare what\\'ll happen afterward.  Just let me go!\"\"You\\'re a fool,\" Rose made cool rejoinder.  \"Where\\'d you go?\"\"I don\\'t know?\"\"What\\'d become of you?\"\"I don\\'t care.\"\"Well, you would care, all right, all right.  You can\\'t go home, andyou\\'ve no clothes and no money and no references.  You couldn\\'t getwork anywhere in New York, and you couldn\\'t get away from New York.\"\"I----\"  Mary groped through the darkness of her soul.  \"I can dohousework.\"\"Not without a reference you can\\'t.\"\"I could go to some office----\"\"If you went to any charity-joint, they\\'d throw you out because ofwhat\\'s happened to you.\"\"I could beg on the street if I had to.\"\"Do you think the men in this town give money for nothing to agood-looking girl?  You could go on the street, that\\'s what you coulddo.\"The phrase was new to its hearer, but the tone explained it.\"Then,\" she stumbled forward, \"I could go to the police.  They\\'d helpme.  I could----\"But at that word Rose flew into a torrent of anger and abuse thatdwarfed the former tempest.\"You could, could you?\" she cried.  \"That\\'s your game, is it, yousneaking little innocent?  I\\'ll bet you\\'re a damn sight wiser thanyou let on.  But you don\\'t know this town: you can take that muchfrom me.  Go to the police!  Go to \\'em!  The cops on this beat are myfriends: if you don\\'t believe it, I\\'ll bring \\'em in and introduceyou.  They\\'re my friends, and so\\'s the whole precinct my friends.  Goto \\'em!  Go to \\'em, and I\\'ll have you pinched and locked up for bein\\'what you are!\"Mary had drawn away from the blast, but Rose\\'s powerful fist caughther under the chin and sent her crashing down on the bed.\"You don\\'t come that on me!\" the jailer continued.  \"You\\'ve got yourchoice: you can stay here and live easy, or walk out and go to jail,and that\\'s all you can do.  Max ain\\'t comin\\' back, and you alwaysknew he wouldn\\'t come back.  You know what this house is as well as Ido, and you\\'ve got to stay here and earn your keep.  If you give oneyip I\\'ll have the cops in!  You don\\'t want to eat, hey?  Well then,you shan\\'t eat!  You can lay there and starve, or you can knock onthe door and get the best breakfast you ever had, all ready for you.Do what you please; but if you let out one yip I\\'ll hammer the lifeout of you!\"She turned and left the room.  She banged the door behind her, andMary, in a swirling dream, heard herself again locked in her cell.VTHE BIRDS OF PREYThrough all the days that immediately followed--the days that werenights, and the nights that were red noondays--a thousand horrors,from subtle word to recurring experience, conjoined to assure to Marythe reality of her servitude.  All of that first day, after Rose hadleft her with the dark blood oozing from her cut chin upon thescented pillows, she lay, like a wounded dog, now in a faint and thenin a stupor, on the disordered bed.  As the sunlight shifted and theshadows lengthened in the room, torpor gave way to reawakened fear,and she crawled into a corner and tried to hide herself, trembling,with chattering teeth, at every sound of laughter that rose from thelower floors, at every footstep upon the stair.Thrice Rose returned.  Each time she bore a steaming dish that, asthe girl\\'s physical pain grew less, assailed the nostrils withincreasing poignancy.  Each time Mary shook her stubborn russet head.And each time the visit ended in a beating.Escape by door or window was out of the question; to attempt to raisean alarm was to invite fresh violence; and gradually grew thecertainty that the situation was genuinely as the jailer haddescribed it: that the street was worse than the house, and that Marywas her own prisoner.  She found the bottle labeled \"Poison,\" and bitone of the tablets, but she was young and afraid, and she spat theburning crumbs from her mouth.  She did not dare to die, and whenRose came again to the room, her captive was too weak to refuse thebroth that was fed her, as if she were a sick child, from a spoon.\"You\\'re a dear girl, after all,\" said the mistress, as sheadministered the grateful food.  \"You do as I say and you won\\'t neverbe sorry.  All I want is to have you sensible.  I\\'m your friend.\"Mary said nothing: she was too weak to answer.\"And now,\" Rose pursued, \"I\\'ll just give you a drink.\"And when she had come back, she had not come back alone.The worst of prisons is that in which the door is so cunningly closedupon the inmate that, at last, after the brutality is familiar, theinmate seems originally to have closed it upon herself, and in such afortress of pain Mary now found herself restrained.  The process wassimple.  It was merely first to wound and then to inure.  The descentto hell is not easy; it is red with blood and wet with tears; buthell itself must be endured.It was not for some days that any woman save Rose came to Mary\\'s celland then, one afternoon, two women followed the grating key.They were alike only as to clothes.  Both wore loose negligégarments, but whereas the one was sturdy and German-blonde, withstraw-colored hair, round and heavy face, blue eyes and peasantframe--a younger Rose--the other was wiry, compact, her brows low anddark under somber hair, her full cheeks red only in defiance of aswarthy skin, her eyes black and her mouth vermillion.  It was thisone who, with an accent that a more sophisticated ear than Mary\\'swould have placed along the Seine, was the first to speak.\"\\'Ello!\" she laughed, her teeth gleaming between her lips likepomegranate seeds.  \"We have come to make the call.\"Without awaiting a reply, she jumped upon the bed, drew her feetbeneath her, and produced and lit a cigarette.  The German girl movedmore slowly to the other side and there elaborately ensconced herself.Mary looked at her visitors without immediately replying.  She hadnot, in fact, the remotest idea of what was the fitting word.But the French girl was unruffled by this silence.  She flung herhead back upon a white neck and sent a slow column of blue smokecurling toward the ceiling.\"My name,\" she explained, with an odd clipping of her speech, \"eetees Celeste, an\\' my good frien\\' here,\" she continued with an easygesture of the cigarette, \"she ees Fritzie--chust a bar-bar-ousGerman.\"Mary looked at her with a gaze large and listless.\"An\\' you\\' name?\" pursued Celeste, \"eet ees--what?\"Fritzie supplied the answer, speaking in a ponderous contralto.\"Her name is Mary,\" said she.\"_Bien_--a pretty name,\" Celeste rattled on, precisely as if herunwilling entertainer had made the response.  \"I like eet well;but\"--and she studied with unobtrusive care the russet-framed,indignant face before her--\"eet ees not so good as ees yourself.  It\\'ink--let me see--yaas: I t\\'ink I shall call you \\'Violet.\\'--Violet,why you don\\'t eat more een dees \\'ouse?\"\"I\\'m hardly ever hungry,\" said Mary.\"Not hongry?--Oh-h, but you mohst be hongry!  Anyone so young mohstwant to eat, and anyone so beautiful mohst eat so as not to loose thebeauty.--Ees eet not so, Fritzie?\"The German girl smiled gently and nodded her blonde head.\"Ach, yes,\" she rumbled.  \"The liebchen!\"\"No,\" insisted Mary.  \"I don\\'t care about nothing.  I have a headacheall the time.  I have one now.\"Celeste jumped lightly to the floor: it was as if to uncoil her feetand to reach the door required but a single movement.\"_Un moment!_\" she laughed.  \"I shall feex the _mal de tête_immediate!\"There was no time for remonstrance; the door closed upon herconcluding word, and Mary was left there gazing into the stolid,sphinxlike face of the placidly smiling German.  It was not a badface, and soon Mary realized that it was a contented one.Fritzie was returning her look with an equal curiosity.\"Are you vorried?\" she finally inquired.\"No,\" lied Mary proudly.\"I dought you looked like vorried,\" the German continued.  \"Bud youshould be nod.  Dis iss a goot place.  Dere are loads vorse blaces inNew York dan dis: I know \\'em.\"She paused, but Mary\\'s lips remained closed, her eyes fixed.\"You bed I know \\'um!\" Fritzie repeated.  \"Bud dis blace--vhy, ve hafde best meals, so goot nobody gould besser haf!  I like dis blace.\"A faint question shot into Mary\\'s face.  At once Fritzie answered it.\"Dat\\'s righd.  Listen: I gome over here two year ago in de steerage.Some of de vomen, men meet dem--oh, most all de nod-family vons--un\\'took dem to dese here intelligence office dat are only fakes, un\\'sold dem, vidout dere knowin\\' nussin\\' of it, fur ten un\\' fifteendollar\\' each.  Bud I vas careful.  I get a real tshob.--Ach, himmel!\"She waved a broad palm in disgust.\"Id vas bad enough in de steerage mit all de sailor-mens kissin\\' youto-day un\\' kickin\\' you to-morrow; bud dat tshob of mine, dat vas dereal limit!  I gome over here because I vouldn\\'t vork in de fieldsback home, bud in dat boarding-house vhere I get dat tshob, I get upat dree o\\'clock every mornin\\', because some of de mens vork inJefferson Market, un\\' I haf to scrub, un\\' make de beds, un\\' helpcook, un\\' vait on dable, un\\' vash dishes, un\\' sweep de whole houseoud.

Un\\' den, aftersome more, I gome here, pretty soon, to Miss Rose\\'s.  No\"--she wavedher thick hand toward the door through which Celeste had latelypassed--\"I\\'m nod like dat Frenchie.  She\\'s vhat Phil Beekman calls a\\'gongenital,\\' vatever dat iss; I vork hard enough now, und I vantedto vork righd den; bud I tell you I could not stand it, dough I vasso strong.  No, I\\'m glad I gome here.\"She leaned back upon her elbow.\"Now, dis Celeste----\" she began, but the French girl, just thenentering, came with an air that was a sufficient explanation of hernever complex temperament.\"_Voilà!_\" she smiled, holding aloft a long glass filled by a dullgreen liquid.  \"Let the leetle girl tak some of thees wheech I meexfor her.\"Before she had well realized what she was doing, Mary had acceptedthe glass.\"What is it?\" she asked weakly.\"Absinthe,\" replied Celeste.\"It smells like licorice,\" said Mary.\"Ah, but no; eet ees not that.  You try thees, an\\' then you can eat.\"\"But I don\\'t think I want to eat.\"\"Poof!  That ees folly!  See, now, I meex thees myself--I myself have_frappé_ eet.  Ees eet what you call polite that you say \\'no\\' to me?Say, now: ees eet?\"Involuntarily Mary smiled.  It was a rueful little smile, but it wasa smile of exhausted consent.\"It won\\'t hurt me?\"\"Thees?  You do not know eet.  Eet ees the enemy of all the headache,of all the heartache, of all the bad nerve.\"For answer Mary drained the glass, and when her visitors left herthey turned no key upon their exit.So, slowly, through all those early days, and through the days thatimmediately followed them, the spell of the situation worked.  Therewas infamy, there was torture.  The unending procession ofvisitors--clerks, drummers, car-conductors, teamsters, gamesters,thieves, brothers in the fraternity of lust, equals in the night ofhorror, mostly drunken, nearly all unclean of body and everyonefilthy of mind--the green government note was their certificate ofqualification, the money, however acquired, constituted their rightto those counterfeits which the house of Rose Légère was maintainedto sell.  For that note, themselves the chattels of conditions, theymight caress or beat; for that, they might take whatever their heartsdemanded.  Was the slave wounded?  Was she ill?  Was she heartbroken?She must smile; she must be one woman to all men.  She must receivethe blows with laughter, the ribaldry, the insults and the curses aswit.  She must pass from this to that--and she must not care.And yet Mary, who was Violet now, could do nothing but take as finalthe conclusion that Rose had drawn for her.  To return home, even ifshe had the money, would be impossible, because to do so would be tocourt her father\\'s anger and her mother\\'s shame, with no hope ofeither pardon or justification.  To go out into the cheerless streetthat sent its growling echoes up to her curtained window would be,she was assured, to deliver herself to arrest or starvation.  She wasignorant and young.  With no knowledge of the laws and the charitiesof the monster town, she saw only that the former, in uniform, was aback-door friend of her keepers, and she was told that the latternever helped before they first publicly burned upon their victims\\'brows the thenceforth ineradicable brand of infamy.  Without therewas, at the least, hunger, drudgery and disgrace; at the most,starvation, jail, death.  Within, where fresh wounds meant butlittle, there obtained, under only a velvet-pawed tyranny, atolerable democracy of disrepute, an equality of degradation, wherefood, at any rate, and shelter and raiment were certain, and whereold scars and fresh bruises were hidden from the world: the price wasno more than supine acquiescence.Anything like financial independence was, of course, impossible: theslaves of Rose Légère were as much slaves as any mutilated black manof the Congo, or any toil-cramped white man in a factory.  Theirwages were paid to the supervisor, their few belongings secretlysearched for gratuities, and though one-half of each payment was,theoretically, the portion of the employé, rent and board and_lingerie_ demanded, and must needs secure, prices that left eachwoman hopelessly in debt to the mistress of the house.With her senses in revolt, the mind and body of the newly-christenedViolet came, by insidious degrees, nevertheless to approach somelikeness to adaptability.  Her material wants never went unsupplied,and such intelligence as she possessed began to swing toward thatpoint of view to differ from which could bring nothing save seriousdiscomfort.  To the hope of Max\\'s return she still, in her own heart,clung with that tenacity which only a woman can exert upon anacknowledged impossibility, but she felt even this hope shrinkbetween her clutching fingers, and, doing her best to reason, sheknew that, even should the miracle happen, Max had brought her andleft her here with the intent that she should fulfill her economicdestiny.Too dull to see deeply into causes, she could only accept the slowlynumbing hail of effects.  Until a few days since, she had been achild, and, like most children, the individual at fault in everypersonal catastrophe.  It was thus that she began by blaming herselffor all that had now befallen her; it was only at moments of growththat she turned her anger first against her own parents, then againstthe active agent and finally against his principal, and it would bebut after deeper vision and harder usage that she could see bothherself and them, and the whole company that made them possible, asmere grist in the mill of a merciless machine.And yet for a long time her one passion was the passion of release.Without clothes and money and protection she could understand noescape; but for these means she at last found courage to appeal tothe one source from which she could conceive of their coming.VIAN ANGEL UNAWARESThe man to whom she first spoke, in a stolen instant, descending thedarkened stair, was a small shopkeeper, fat and pliable, beyond theage of violence, and, as he had just told her, a husband and thefather of a girl of her own age.\"Listen,\" she said, with one trembling hand upon his shoulder, \"Iwant you to do me a favor.\"\"Anything you say, Violet,\" he chuckled.\"Don\\'t talk so loud, then.  I--I want you to take me out of here.\"The man looked at her, through the rosy twilight, in a flatteredbewilderment.\"Like me as much as that, do you?\" he sparred.\"You don\\'t understand.  Of course, I like you; but what I meantwas----\"He interrupted her, his fat fingers complacently patting her cheek.\"It\\'s not me that don\\'t tumble to the facts,\" he said; \"it\\'s you.  Itold you I was a family man.  I couldn\\'t put you anywhere.\"\"I don\\'t mean that.  I mean----\"But again he cut in upon her labored explanation, his commercial mindtraveling along lines in which it had been forced all his life totravel, and his pride entrenching itself behind the trivial rampartof his income.\"You girls!\" he laughed, in palpable deception.  \"You all think I\\'vegot a lot of money.  Why, there ain\\'t no use thinkin\\' you can bleedme.  I\\'m a business man, an\\' I do everything on a straight businessbasis, but I wouldn\\'t rent a flat for the finest of you that everwalked Fourteenth Street.\"Violet\\'s answer was brief.  That she should have given her confidenceto such a beast, that such a beast should continue to thrive in theworld that was closed to her, and that, her pitiable confidence oncegiven, she should be so grossly misinterpreted--these things sent ared rage rushing to her now always incarnadined cheeks.  She gave theshopkeeper a push that nearly sent him rolling to the foot of thestairs.\"Get away from me!\" she whispered hoarsely.  \"Get away!  I wouldn\\'thave you for a gift!\"The man stumbled and gripped the rose-colored lamp upon thenewel-post, which swayed, under his rocking weight, like a palm-treein a storm.  He gasped for breath, got it, and, shaking his fistupward through the shadows, began to bellow forth a storm of oathsthat, for foulness, utterly outdid the ejaculations to which, fromboth sexes, Violet was already becoming accustomed.\"You come down here,\" he courageously shouted, \"and I\\'ll give you theworst beating you ever had in your life!  Nice place, this is!  I\\'llhave it pinched--you see if I don\\'t!  You can\\'t make an easy thingout o\\' me!  You\\'ve robbed me, anyhow.  You\\'ll get what\\'s comin\\' toyou!\"--And he ended with the single epithet to which those four wallswere unaccustomed.Rose ran out from the parlor.\"Shut up, you!\" she commanded of the disturber, in a low tone thatnevertheless compelled obedience.  \"What\\'s the trouble, Violet?\"Violet leaned against the stair-wall, half-way up, her burning handspressed to her burning face.  She was mad with anger and shame, butshe was also afraid.\"You heard him,\" she gasped.\"Yes,\" snapped the visitor, his voice uncontrollably resuming itsformer timbre, \"and you heard me, too!\"The mistress is, of necessity, always, in a crisis, against the slave.\"Well,\" said Rose, \"tell me what she done.\"Violet, however, saw at once the necessity of changing the issue.\"He says he\\'s been robbed!\" she called down the stairs.  And then sheran after her words, and stood under the lamp, facing them both, herarms extended, the flowing sleeves trembling with the emotion thatthey covered but could not conceal.  \"Search me!\" she commanded.  \"Ifyou think I took a cent of yours, search me!\"She was a vision that brought conviction with it.Before the sputtering visitor could correct the situation, Rose had,perhaps against her will, been converted.  She took the man\\'s hatfrom the hall-rack at her side, put it on his head, opened thestreet-door, and gently propelled him through it.\"You\\'re drunk,\" she said, \"an\\' you\\'d better get out before I call thecop.  There ain\\'t no badger business in this house, an\\' don\\'t youforget it!\"She shut the door, and turned calmly to Violet.\"How much did you get?\" she asked.\"Why, Miss Rose, you know----\"\"I mean what did you touch him for?  You mustn\\'t play that sort ofgame here: it gives the house a bad name.  But just this once we\\'lldivide up an\\' not say anything more about it.\"Violet\\'s eyes opened wide.\"I didn\\'t steal a penny,\" she declared.Rose regarded her with a softening countenance.\"Word of honor?\" she asked.\"Word of honor,\" vowed Violet.\"All right, but even if you do touch them, you mustn\\'t ever let them_think_ you do.  A man\\'ll forgive you for hurtin\\' him anywhere but inhis pocket-book.--You\\'re all worked up, dearie.  Come on out to thekitchen an\\' have a bottle of beer.\"As they were pouring the drinks, a heavy foot sounded in the outsidepassageway and a careful four knocks followed upon the rear door.\"That\\'s Larry,\" said Rose, and drew the bolt.A policeman\\'s hat was poked through the doorway, followed by aflushed, genial Irish face, and a tall, hulking body in regulationuniform.\"I\\'m terrible dry,\" grinned Larry.\"Then you\\'ve come to the right shop,\" was Rose\\'s greeting.  \"We\\'rejust havin\\' a little drop ourselves.  Larry, this is my new friend,Violet.\"The policeman grinned again, and sat carefully upon the edge of akitchen-chair, in evident fear that his bulk might prove too greatfor it.\"Glad to know you,\" he said.\"Larry\\'s on this beat nights,\" Rose explained to Violet, \"an\\' him an\\'the lieutenant look after us--don\\'t you, Riley?\"\"Well, what use is a frind if he don\\'t take care of yez, Miss Rose?We do the bist we can.\"\"I know that.--What\\'ll it be, Larry?  We\\'re takin\\' beer, but there\\'swine on the ice if you want it.\"\"I\\'ll just have a small drap of liquor, ma\\'am, please,\" said Riley.Rose poured and handed to him a glass of whiskey.\"When you came by,\" she inquired, \"did you see a fat man throwin\\'fits in our gutter?\"\"Why, I did not.  Have ye been afther havin\\' a rumpus the night?\"\"Oh, no--only that fat little fellow that keeps the jewelry-storearound the corner.  He was drunk, an\\' I threw him out.  If he triesto get gay, let me know, will you?\"\"Of course I\\'ll let ye know--an\\' here\\'s to your very good health,ma\\'am an\\' miss.--But you may rist aisy; that there won\\'t be nothrouble.\"\"I know that: he\\'s too scared of his wife.--Have another, won\\'t you?\"The officer rose.\"No, thank ye kindly,\" he said.  \"I wanted but the drap, ma\\'am.\"\"And how are Mrs. Riley and the children?\"Larry\\'s face became a web of smiling wrinkles.\"Grand,\" he said; \"the auld woman\\'s grand--you ought to see her inthe new silk dress I bought \\'er the day--all grane wid fancytrimmin\\'s from Six\\' Avenoo.  An\\' the kiddies is thrivin\\'.  Cecilia\\'llsoon be havin\\' to go to work an\\' help the family funds, she\\'s thatsthrong and hearty, an\\' young Van Wyck is such a divil that theteacher throwed him out of school.  He\\'s licked all the b\\'ys in hisclass, an\\' I think he\\'ll end as a champeen pug.\"He went out, still smiling, and, as he did so, Violet saw Rose, afterstooping hurriedly, place in his hands a yellow bill.  As the doorclosed, there came into the younger woman\\'s eyes the question thatshe would not have dared to ask.\"Yep,\" nodded Rose, \"that\\'s my week\\'s pay for what they callprotection.\"\"Isn\\'t he afraid to take it?\" Violet, thus encouraged, inquired.\"The man above him isn\\'t afraid to take two-thirds of it,\" said Rose,\"an\\' the best of it goes past him to the district boss--it\\'s theregular system with the regular prices.  Oh, no, he ain\\'t afraid; an\\'if you ever tried to live on a copper\\'s pay, you\\'d soon be afraid notto take it.\"Violet, returning to the parlor, bit her lip: there was indeed smallhelp to be had from the law.Small help, either there or elsewhere.  She turned, naturally, onlyto the seemingly more prosperous customers, but, even by them, shewas met with smiling incredulity: her story was so hackneyed that itcould not be true.\"It\\'s all right enough to want to get out of here,\" said her sagestadviser, who at least paid her the rare compliment of credence; \"buthow are you going to live after you get out?  You can\\'t go home; youhaven\\'t got any trade; you can\\'t cook; without a recommendation youcan\\'t get even a job at general housework or in a factory.\"He was a quiet, middle-aged widower that said this, an infrequentvisitor, a chief clerk in one of the departments of a large insurancecompany, with a reputation for liberal kindliness at Rose\\'s and, inhis own little world, a position of some influence.\"You get me out,\" said Violet, \"an\\' I\\'ll do the rest.\"But here again the gate was barred against her.  The clerk wasburdened with a good name and a place of trust.  He could riskneither the one nor the other.  He was sorry, genuinely sorry--shesaw that; but what could he do?It was an evening or two later that she found her first pale ray ofencouragement, and she found it in the person of Philip Beekman, thatsame young Beekman to whom Fritzie had casually referred.Beekman described himself, with some accuracy, as a person of goodfamily and bad morals.  \"We are getting so confounded poor,\" he usedto say, \"that I sometimes doubt the former; but I have constantvisible evidence of the latter, and so I cling to that as the onesure thing in this uncertain life.\"  Had he but seen the facts, hemight well have considered his derelictions as the result of hisparentage.  At her divorce, his mother had been awarded the custodyof her only child, and, now that she had remarried, Philip was forcedto play that neither uncommon nor congenial rôle--the part of theyoung man with too little training to earn a living and too muchancestry to marry one.\"After all,\" he said, as he sat with Violet in the many-colored backparlor, a half-empty bottle between them, his usually pale faceaglow, his gray eyes filmy, and his black hair tumbled by theconstant passage through it of his long, nervous fingers--\"after all,you see, you and I are in the same boat.  You can\\'t get out because,if you do, the sharks will eat you, and I daren\\'t get out because Ican\\'t swim.\"Always haunted by the fear that, in some manner, her true story mightreach her own town and her own people, Violet had told him only asmuch as she dared, and what she had said had moved his impulsivegenerosity.\"But anyway,\" he insisted, \"you can do one thing that I can\\'t.\"She clutched at the straw.\"What\\'s that?\" she asked.\"You can get help from shore.\"\"How do you mean?\"\"I mean that if you\\'ll write a letter home, I\\'ll mail it.\"She shook her head: the straw crumpled in her fingers.\"There\\'s no use of that,\" she said.\"Of course there is.  After all, your father\\'s your father, you see,and I don\\'t know a father that wouldn\\'t help his daughter out of thesort of mess you\\'ve got into.\"\"I know one,\" said Violet, grimly.\"Not till you try him, you don\\'t.\"\"Yes, I do.  If you was in my place would your father----\"\"Which father?\" laughed Beekman.  \"My one won\\'t have anything to dowith me because I live with the other, and the other won\\'t haveanything to do with me because I\\'m the son of his predecessor.--Youtake my advice and write home.\"\"I\\'d never get an answer.\"She spoke in an even tone, but there was no mistaking the tragedythat underlay it.Beekman looked at her and blinked queerly.  He brought his fist downsmartly among the jangling glasses.\"It\\'s a rotten shame!\" he said.  \"A dirty, rotten shame!  Why, don\\'tyou know that that yid who got you into this makes a business of suchthings?  Don\\'t you know there\\'s a whole army of them that do?  I wishto the Lord I could do something, but there isn\\'t a policeman or amagistrate in the city who\\'d listen to me--they know too well wherethey get the jam for their bread and butter--and I can\\'t get a jobfor even myself, let alone you!\"She had not, however, heard his last sentence.  Her blue eyes wide,she was hanging on his reference to Max.\"A business?\" she repeated.  \"Do you mean that men make money--thatway?\"\"Of course I do.\"  The film passed suddenly from Beekman\\'s eyes,leaving them alert with purpose.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"there is onething I can do, and I don\\'t know anything that I\\'d enjoy more: yougive me that little kyke\\'s name, and I\\'ll push his face out of theback of his head!\"Then there happened a strange thing.  She had long guessed and nowshe knew, but guessing or knowing, she would not believe.  As muchfor her own sanity as for Max\\'s safety, she lied.\"The name he gave me,\" she said, \"wasn\\'t his right one.  It wasn\\'teven one he mostly used.  And I never knew no other.\"Beekman raised his hands in more than mock despair, and got up to go.\"Well,\" he declared, \"I don\\'t know what I can do for you.  If I gotinto any scandal, it would punch the last hole in my meal-ticket.\"Violet, who was becoming accustomed to such replies, smiled kindly.\"I don\\'t want you to get into no trouble for me,\" she said.\"I know you don\\'t, and I couldn\\'t be any use if I did.  But I\\'llpromise you this: I\\'ll keep my eyes open, and if anything does turnup, I\\'ll be Johnny-on-the-spot, all right.\"\"Thank you,\" said Violet.\"And look here,\" pursued Beekman, \"I know that it\\'s all rot to expectyou to walk out of here without friends or a job; I know that, unlessyou\\'ve got one or the other, you\\'re just simply in jail here; but ifI can\\'t get you anything, there must be those who can.  Why don\\'t youtalk to the coal-men, or the gas-inspectors, or--I tell you, I\\'veseen that tow-headed Dutchman who leaves the beer here.  He looksstraight, and he stops at the door.  Why don\\'t you talk to him?  He\\'sthe sort that would know of a job for--for----\"Beekman hesitated, blushing like a schoolboy.\"For my sort?\" asked Violet.  \"Maybe he is.  Thank you.  Anyhow I\\'llsee.\"And she did see.  When Beekman left her, pressing into her hand thelast piece of money that he would have for a week, he gave her at thesame time so much of hope.  Those who seemed rich could not help her;she would appeal to those who were poor.She was up early and in the kitchen the next morning at the hour whenshe knew the brewery-wagon would stop outside, and she sent the ebonCassie on an errand to the corner pharmacy.  The maid had scarcelyclosed the door before Violet was summoned to open it to the Germanof whom Beekman had spoken.Philip had observed well.  The brewery\\'s driver, who stood whistlingin the areaway, was a short, stocky man with the neck and arms of agladiator and the round, smiling face of a child.  His blue overallsand dark cloth cap accentuated the fairness of his hair, and hisround inquiring eyes were alive with continual good-humor.  He hadjust piled a half-dozen cases of beer beside the doorway.Violet, in her crimson kimona, took from the table the money that hadbeen left for him.\"Good-morning,\" she said as she handed him the bills.He accepted the money with his left hand and, with his right, raisedhis cap from his clustering curls.  His lips ceased whistling, halfregretfully.\"Goot-mornin\\',\" he replied, smiling.\"Won\\'t you come in and have a drink?\" asked Violet, adopting Rose\\'sform of salutation.\"No, t\\'ank you,\" the German shook his head.  \"I neffer trinks nussingbud beer.\"\"Well,\" said Violet, \"we have lots of that now.\"\"Und I neffer trink dot till tinner.\"There was an awkward pause.  The German, not knowing how to leavewithout seeming rudeness, was shifting his weight from one heavilyshod foot to the other.  The woman, uncertain how to say the wordsshe wanted to say, remained with her hand upon the knob.\"You don\\'t?\" she awkwardly repeated.\"No, und so I t\\'ink--I t\\'ink I besser be goin\\',\" he hurriedlyconcluded, and began to turn on his heel.The necessity for quick action roused her.\"Wait,\" she said.  And then, as he faced her again in mute wonder,she pressed another bill into his hand.  \"I want you to help me,\" shecontinued.  \"I want to get a job somewhere, and I don\\'t want MissRose to know nothing about it.\"He looked from the bill to her, still wondering.\"So-o?\" he responded.\"Yes, I want work--some other kind of work--and I thought perhaps youmight\"--her voice faltered--\"might know of some kind.\"The German\\'s mobile face underwent a quick change.  Firstastonishment and then something not far removed from tears came intohis childlike eyes.  He crushed the bill in his big red fist.\"So-o?\" he repeated.\"Yes, I--you understand that I must have friends or a job if I am toget away from here, and I thought you might know of something.\"The German bobbed his curls.\"I know dot right vell,\" he said; \"bud I don\\' know no tshob chustnow.\"Violet\\'s face darkened.\"All right,\" she answered, \"I only hoped maybe----\"\"Look here, miss,\" the driver cut in with a note of ready feeling inhis voice.  \"You mean all dot?\"\"All what?\"\"About geddin\\' ozzer--aboud a real tshob.\"\"If I had the clothes and a place I\\'d go this minute.\"\"Vell, den, listen.  I\\'ve chust god a new blace; I\\'m goin\\' to bebar-tender ofer on Segond Avenue, bud I gan send back here if I hearanysing.--Your name?\"\"Violet--just Miss Violet.\"\"All righd, Miss Violet, I know some more aboud dese blaces like disdan you maybe t\\'ink, und I guess maybe I gan do somesing.  Nex\\'Sunday I dake my girl to Coney, und den ve\\'ll dalk sings ofer undve\\'ll see vhat Katie says.\"In spite of the promised delay and the growing habit of doubt,Violet\\'s face kindled.\"You\\'re good,\" she said simply, \"and I\\'ll trust you.\"\"Oh, I make nussing,\" replied the German, smiling once more, \"budchust you vait: Katie gan fix it; she gan fix anysing.\"Before Violet could reply, he had resumed his whistling and run downthe alleyway; and she saw that he had tossed back her money on thetopmost beercase.VIIHOLIDAYThat Sunday morning in his single, dark, narrow room, HermannHoffmann, the erstwhile driver of a brewery-wagon and the comingSecond Avenue barkeeper, arose with the dawn, just as if it had beena workday morning, and set about his elaborate toilet, whistling.To the casual eye there would have seemed little in his surroundingsto inspire any lyric joy.  The cell-like apartment, which was theonly spot on earth that Hermann might call his home, was a back roomon the top floor of a damp and gloomy tenement in a filthy courtrunning off Houston Street near Avenue A.  Only at noon did the palesunlight strain into that court, crowded all morning with malariousdogs and dirty, toddling babies solemnly, but vainly, trying to learnhow to play, and echoing all through the black night now to thecurses of scarred, slinking tiger-cats, now to the staggeringfootsteps or the brawling oaths of drunkards reeling homeward throughthe evil-smelling darkness, and again to the piercing cry of a womanin mortal agony or mortal fear.Robbins\\'s Row was no place for a policeman after nightfall, andscarcely a safer place for a stranger by day.  From its sagging fileof dirty, paper-patched windows, more or less feminine shapes leanedout, calling gossip to their neighbors, and hauling at the pulliedropes that, crossing the street, spread above the pedestrians atossing, parti-colored canopy of \"wash.\"  You entered it by climbingthree rotting wooden steps, by stumbling through a wet hall, where ablue-burning gas-jet accentuated the sense of perpetual midnight, andyou could reach the room of Hermann Hoffmann only by a perilous climbof six flights of stairs.That room was as bare as any in the building.  It looked out, by asingle slit in the wall, upon a light-shaft, strangely misnamed.  Itsonly furniture was a cot, a wooden-seated chair, a washstand, and,bearing comb and brushes and shaving-utensils, one of those pinebureaus the drawers of which may be opened in ten minutes, andclosed, if you are lucky, in fifteen.  Yet the note of the place wasthe note of order and of neatness; the bare floor was clean, and,against the fresh and brightly papered wall, there hung here a calicocurtain that hid the tenant\\'s wardrobe and there a single shelfbearing only, as if it were an altar consecrated to one holy object,a thumbed and dog\\'s-eared copy of \"Das Kapital.\"Hermann plunged his ruddy face, whistling, into a bowl of water anddrew it out, more ruddy and whistling still.  Even the author of thatportentous volume on the book-shelf used to sing \"Strausbourg,\" andHermann\\'s single anthem was \"Die Wacht Am Rhein.\"Still pursuing that inspiring music, he turned to the bureau andbegan to shave the yellow down from his cheeks and chin.  Thrustbetween the exaggerating mirror and its frame were twophotographs--the one, a trifle faded, of a matronly, kindly woman ofhis own race, perhaps fifty years old, stiffly arrayed in a silkdress rigorously American, and the other, a new one, that of a younggirl in a great hat and unmistakably Manhattan dress, a young girlwith a pretty, piquant face of that distinctively American type--theIrish.  Perhaps these photographs distracted the German\\'s attention;perhaps it was only that no man living can successfully whistle andshave at one and the same time.  At any rate, his hand shook, and therazor cut a light gash in his upper lip.He flung the offending blade from him, and it struck the mirror,cracking the glass across one corner.\"Ach, Gott,\" he smiled, as he staunched the blood with a heavypressure through a rough towel; and then, in the English that he usedeven in his soliloquies: \"Dey say now dot means bad luck fer sevenyear.  Lucky is\\'t dot I am not suberstitious!\"And then, undisturbed, he quietly resumed his whistling, finishedshaving, sleeked down his rebellious tow-colored curls, got into anewly pressed brown suit and yellow shirt, donned a high collar andsalmon tie, and, setting a carefully brushed derby upon his head,descended to the narrow street, the strains of \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\"lingering behind him through the darkened hallway.To accomplish the purpose of his early rising, he took the ThirdAvenue elevated to the Forty-second Street station.  There he boughttwo bouquets of carnations--one pink and the other white--and boardeda suburban train, which bore him, at last, to one of those littlestations that New York, which has so small time for remembrance, hasselected for the hiding of its dead.In the warm sunlight of the spring morning, Hermann picked hiscertain way among the green grass and the white-roofed habitations ofthe sleepers, until he came upon a little plot, by no means thecheapest or more obscure in the burying-ground, and there, his lipsstill pursed, but silent now, took off his shining derby and pausedbefore the solitary white stone.  With much that was unaffectedlyreverent, he knelt, according to his weekly custom, and placed thewhite carnations on the grave, and with a great deal that was just asunaffectedly proud, he read, also according to that custom, theinscription cut upon the white stone that he had purchased with what,when he paid the bill, happened to be his last dollar:  Here In Peace  Lies The Body Of  WlLHELMINA HOFFMANN,  Widow Of Ludwig Hoffmann,  Of Andernach, Rhenish Prussia,  Who Dep\\'t\\'d This Life, Jan. 10, 1907.  ------  \"_Wait thou, wait thou; soon thou shall rest also._\"The inscription was in English, but when he had finished reading it,the dead woman\\'s son said, under his breath, the Lord\\'s Prayer in thelanguage of Luther, as she had taught it him.\"She liked me to pray,\" he shamefacedly explained to thecircumambient atmosphere, as if prayer in any tongue were acompromise with his principles.  \"Und vhile I\\'m aboud it, I mighd asvell use de old langwage.  If the Herr Gott listens at all, He\\'d hearit some besser in de vay She said it.\"And then he resumed his hat and his anthem, and returned to town.Katie Flanagan was waiting for him as he came hurrying up the stepsfrom the subway at Park Place--the piquant, pretty girl of thephotograph, in black, because her parents had died not long since,but in black just as elaborate as her slender purse would permit,because she knew the full value of her raven hair and blossomingcheeks and tender eyes of Irish blue.\"Ach,\" gasped Hermann, \"hof I kep\\' you a long time vaitin\\'?\"\"Only about as long as you mostly do,\" she answered.  Her voice waslike her eyes, and she spoke with but the charming hint of a Galwaybrogue.The German\\'s cheeks burned with humiliation.\"I\\'m sorry,\" he apologized.  \"I god up early to be on dime, bud detrain vas lade from the cem\\'t\\'ry in.\"She understood and smiled.\"It\\'s only five minutes I\\'ve been here,\" she confessed.\"Und I brought you a few bosies, Katie.  I d\\'ought maybe----\"\"Oh!\" she seized the carnations with a laugh of delight, and buriedher nose in them.  \"It\\'s good y\\'are to think of such things,Hermann--and a bad lad that y\\'are to spend the money so!\"They were making their way toward the Bridge, the sturdy Hoffmannshouldering a passage through the momentarily swelling Sunday morningcrowd.\"Dot liddle makes nussing,\" he proudly protested.  \"To-morrow I beginad my new tshob.\"\"But that,\" said Katie, \"won\\'t pay you hardly wan dollar a weekmore\\'n the brewery did.  I dunno, but I think----\"There, however, her protest, for the moment, ended.  They werecaught, clinging together, in the whirlpool of the entrance; carriednearly off their feet, rushed by the ticket-window with a quickexchange of small coin, and, a few minutes later, were battling theirway among the press into a waiting Coney Island train.In the last charge, Hermann, his lips puckered in the battle-hymn,did heroic service.  While Katie hung tightly to one arm, he usedmanfully the elbow of the other; pushed a guard to the right; shovedtwo cigarette-smoking youths to the left; wriggled through thealready crowded platform and shot into one of the coveted\"cross-seats.\"  Much of the park would not be open for a month ormore to come, but New York was already clamoring for its playground.Katie, flushed and triumphant, sank beside him, and busied herselfwith the task of straightening her big black hat.  Hermann watchedher in frank admiration as she sat there, her arms raised to herhead, in that pose which, of all others, is the most becoming to hersex.\"What are you lookin\\' at?\" she archly wondered, casting a smiling,sidelong, blue glance at him.But before her the strong man was a timid child.\"Ad de brettiest bicture in a whole vorld,\" he stammered.Katie laughed again.\"Och,\" she said in gratified disapproval, \"there sure must be aCastle Blarney somewhere on the Rhine.  What favor are you wantin\\' toask me now, I wonder.\"Once he had started, Hermann was too dogged thus to be retarded.\"It\\'s chust de same old fafor,\" he pleaded, as, with a great creakingof brakes, the train began to swing upon the Bridge.  \"Now I god mynew tshob, Katie, there gan\\'t for nod hafin\\' our veddin\\' be no goodreason, gan dere?\"\"There\\'s one,\" she said, still delighting in her coquetry; \"there\\'sone reason.\"\"Vat is \\'t?\"\"Its name is Father Kelly.\"\"Katie, you von\\'t led dot gount!\"\"I will so.\"\"Und I haf to gome into your church, und--und all dem d\\'ings?\"\"You do that.\"Hermann squirmed; but he knew of old that from this point she wasneither to be persuaded nor driven.  It was a discussion that theyhad held many a time before, and every time she would give him noanswer to his suit until he should surrender in this particular.Now, however, he considered himself about to set foot upon thehighroad to prosperity, and the prosperous can ill afford to skimpmagnanimity.\"_All_ righd,\" he at last somewhat ruefully conceded, though withcertain mental reservations into which it seemed then unnecessary toenter: \"I\\'m a strong von, und hof stood a lot a\\'ready, so I t\\'ink Igan stand dot too.  I\\'ll do it.\"He took her by surprise.\"Promise?\" she asked.\"Sure I bromise.\"\"No backin\\' out whatever happens?\"\"No packin\\' oud.\"\"Well, God bless you then.\"There was a catch in her voice as she said it.  Into her lonely,hardworking life, this strong, soft-hearted, poor and cheerful Germanhad brought about all the sunshine that she had latterly known, andshe could think of nothing better than to give him the answer that hewas so honestly anxious to hear.  But, though he had become more andmore to her from the first evening when he had seized her as she wasfalling from the platform of a surface-car that had started tooquickly on its way, she had seen enough of the warfare with povertyin her own family to resolve that she would not marry until she couldcontribute her share to the wages of the resulting household, and nowshe had neither a position nor the immediate likelihood of obtainingone.  It was hard, but she was used to hardship, and so, because shemust not cry, she smiled.Hermann tried to grasp her hand, but she easily eluded him.\"Den, vhen do ve say?\" he eagerly demanded.Much as it hurt her to hurt him, she laughed her answer:\"As soon as I get me fingers on a job that\\'ll pay me six dollars aweek, we\\'ll have Father Kelly say the words for us.\"\"But Katie\"--he used to say \"Gatie\" until she had teased him out ofit--\"you don\\' mean dot!  You said--you dold me--you bromise----\"He floundered in the breakers of amazement.  She turned her faceaway, and looked out of the window at the gigantic mockery of Libertyin the harbor; but she could not find it in her heart long to remainsilent.  She faced him once more.\"It\\'s no use, Hermann,\" she said, her eyes very big and serious.\"Here y\\'are goin\\' to Schleger\\'s place with your first good chance ata way as\\'ll lead you to somethin\\' worth workin\\' for--you saidyourself it might end in a café o\\' your own--an\\' to get there you\\'llbe needin\\' every blessed cent you can save.  Do you think now I couldlook at meself in the glass mornin\\'s if I married you an\\' kep\\' youdown?  No, thank God, I\\'m not so bad as that.\"He sputtered toward a protest, but she waved him down.\"Now don\\'t be tellin\\' me that two can live as cheap as one,\" shesaid.  \"I seen that pleasant lie nailed this many a year, an\\' I knowmore about housekeepin\\' in five minutes than you can learn in alifetime.  Things was plenty bad five years past, an\\' now they\\'reworse yet.  What rent is you know, an\\' what clothes is you can\\'t evenguess.  Here\\'s beefsteak at twenty-two cents the pound; veal up tothirty an\\' still goin\\' up.  The papers make a fuss an\\' get the pricesdown three cents for three days, an\\' then the dealers put them upagain when none\\'s lookin\\'.  An\\' as for eggs, you can pay seventy-fivecents a dozen for them, winters, with the hour an\\' minute of thelayin\\' stamped on them, if you\\'re a millionaire, or you can get ninefor a quarter if you hold your nose.\"The hopeful Hermann shook his blonde head.\"But Katie,\" he said, \"I don\\' gare if I neffer ged a gafé off my own.I don\\' vant a gafé: I vant you.\"She smiled again.\"You flatter me by the choice,\" she said; \"but if we can get alongwithout the drink, we can\\'t get along without a bite to eat now an\\'then.  No, Hermann-boy, it\\'s no use, I\\'m tellin\\' you.  I seen ittried.  Me father swang a pick and me mother took in washin\\'--whenshe could get it--an\\' even then it wouldn\\'t work: the one would havestarved to death if the third rail hadn\\'t got him, an\\' poor motherkilled herself tryin\\' to keep her an\\' me.  It won\\'t work, an\\' I knowit.\"While the train hurried above the dead level of Brooklyn houses, outthrough the suburban monstrosities and across the dunes, theoptimist, still an optimist, renewed his endeavors to find the chancefor lodging his own arguments; but all the while Katie continued tooverwhelm him with a flow of errors.  They had almost reached thesandy island before Hermann, still stubbornly hopeful, elected todrop the subject for the present, and took up, in its stead, thestory of Violet.He spoke simply, which is to say forcibly, and he had anunderstanding, and therefore sympathetic, audience.  Katie\\'s faceimmediately softened.\"The poor child!\" she murmured.  \"An\\' don\\'t I know what it is?  I\\'veseen them go under, here one an\\' there another, hungry or overworked,every mother\\'s daughter of them.  There was Molly Ryan, as good agirl as you\\'d find in a day\\'s search of the parish, left alone withno one to put clothes on her back; an\\' pretty Agnes Donovan--out ofwork for four months--her as died in the City Hospital; an\\' GiuliaFortuni, whose father kept a fruit-stand by the Grand Street \"L\"station.--What can we do for her, Hermann-boy?\"\"Dot\\'s vat I vanted to ask you, Katie,\" said Hoffmann.  \"She has tohof friends und vork first of all.\"\"Friends she has right here; but work she must have whether or no.  Ibegin me old search for meself in the mornin\\', an\\' I\\'ll keep eye an\\'mouth ready to get a job for her.\"Cynically hopeless and city-wise in regard to her own chances,Katie\\'s Celtic soul warmed to something of Hermann\\'s optimism in thecause of a sister.  She began planning at once, and when the traindrew up outside the tunnel-shed, she had the absent Violetestablished as a cloak-model in the big Lennox Department-Store, andengaged to marry a floor-walker.And then Coney--Coney the sweetly reasonable in price and theextravagantly generous in provision--crowded out of her mind, forthat day, all thoughts save the thought of itself.A great many years ago--oh, a very great many years ago!--when youwere a little boy, your father took you to the county-fair.  Youremember it, even yet, as a purple day in the glad calendar of yourchildhood: the blood cattle, the show of farm implements, the prizepumpkins, the side-shows with their fat ladies and skeletongentlemen, and the suave individual that put a bean under a cup andthen, for a dollar, showed your shrewd parent that it was underanother.  But above all you remember the crowd.  Never before had youseen so many people in one place, never realized that there were somany people in the world; and even now, out of the past, you can hearan awed voice saying:\"There are five thousand persons here.\"Well, back home, the county-fair, thank heaven, continues to grow.Cattle are sleeker and pumpkins larger; the fat ladies weigh more andthe thin gentlemen less; the shell-game, in one form or another, aidsthe progress of agriculture by making five dollars grow where onlyone grew before.  But, in the meantime, the ugly, delightful\"amusement-park\" has brought the county-fair to the city-limit, andnearly three hundred thousand persons go to Coney Island every day.Early in the season though they were, Katie and Hermann no soonerstepped upon that Surf Avenue which is at once the heart and theaorta of the Island, than they felt, as there they always felt, thatthey had entered upon the Land of Carnival.  The broad, but crowded,way was dancing with the noise of festival, with the clangor of brassbands, the cries of venders, the smell of the circus, the tang of thesea.Here, from mixed drinks to mixed music, went not the thugs andblacklegs, the pallid men and the painted women that would havefilled such a place had it been within the borough of Manhattan.  Intheir stead here drove the cars of generally stolid people ofbusiness and leisure, and here, above all, walked the workers of thecity, the weaker sex and the stronger, seeking holiday.  Thefull-portion hat on the half-portion girl is as familiar to SurfAvenue as to the Waldorf palm-room; care is erased from the tabletsof memory.  On Coney there is no To-morrow.The laughter of the hundreds of children rang out no more freely thandid that of the thousands of their elders.  Mothers with babies intheir arms were young again.  Stately blondes and languorousbrunettes, gracefully seated on the wooden steeds of the score ofmerry-go-rounds, rode with a dignity unsurpassed in Hyde Park or theBois, and never a cowboy at a round-up was more adventurous than theyoung East-Sider mounting a hired horse upon the Pony Track.Every nook had something to sell, and Katie had her day\\'s work inkeeping Hermann from stopping at each booth.  There were miles ofscenic railways on all of which he wished to ride; there were scoresof panorama that tempted him with pictures of every disaster from theSan Francisco fire to the Messina earthquake.  There were thefamiliar canes waiting to be caught with the familiar ring: therewere the familiar chutes to be shot, and the familiar \"galleries\"where the rattle of rifles recalled the battle of the Yalu.  Down onthe beach an army was shouting in the surf, and on every hand alongthe jostling, good-natured street were peanuts and popcorn,\"crispettes\" and \"hot dogs.\"  Upon dozens of polished floors dancerswere slowly revolving with a marvelous ability to distinguish betweenthe time of their own orchestra and that of the band in the caféopposite, and everywhere were picture machines and machines that sang.Cheap it doubtless was, but cheap also in the sense of small cost.Except in the larger cafés, the ordinary drinks sold at only fivecents the glass, and the glasses were not an insult to the drinkers\\'capacity.  Hermann and Katie had their beer at one of the smallerplaces.  They dined for twenty-five cents apiece, without tips, atthe \"Home-Made-Lunch-Room\"; they were twirled and buffeted in aswiftly revolving car down a series of precipitous canvas chasms,paying five cents apiece for the privilege of the shaking-up that, athome, Hermann would have resented with a blow; and they chose thelast seat in the last car of a steep gravity railway, where a manmust hold himself aboard with one arm and his shrieking sweetheartaboard with the other.It was all blatant, all tawdry, all the apotheosis of the ridiculous,all essentially America-at-play; but when, at night, in theelectric-train shooting through the warm darkness, the pair returnedcitywards, it was toward their own hard-earned and with difficultyretained places of shelter that they were going, like children aftera strenuous holiday of make-believe with school to begin upon themorrow; and if, in most of the seats, as in that occupied by Katieand Hermann, girls slept with their heads resting frankly uponsleeping masculine shoulders, it was but a rest before conventionalpartings at home-doorways, the play-day ended for the lonely couch,and the work-day soon to begin.VIIIMR. WESLEY DYKERIn that company of the ignoble army of martyrs over whichcircumstances had given Rose Légère command, there were five members.Besides Mary, who now was Violet, Celeste, whom ancient conditionshad temperamentally predetermined for such service, and Fritzie, whohad chosen a partly moral slavery as less onerous than a whollyeconomic servitude, there was the highly colored Englishwoman Evelyn,who regarded her present station as one of the descending stepsinevitable for everyone that set foot upon the way they all weretreading, and Wanda, a dark little Russian Jewess, who, as soon asshe had landed at the South Ferry from Ellis Island, had fallen intothe hands of the slave-traders, and had thenceforward persistentlystriven upward to the place she now inhabited.For the maintenance of her authority upon these and their patrons,Rose, unlike some of her fellows, did not have to depend upon theassistance of any man quartered in the house.  To the discipline ofthe inmates her system of charge for clothes, food, and shelter wasadmirably suited; for the regulation of the visitors the generallynearby person of big Larry Riley, the policeman, amply sufficed.  Oneother outsider seemed, however, to have a regular connection with theestablishment, and this person early excited Violet\\'s curiosity.Dressed in the extreme of fashion, as fashion is known fromFourteenth Street southward, his gray, almost white, suits alwaysfresh from the pressing-iron, and his flowered tie and ever evidentgay silk handkerchief always glaringly new, this dapper, dark youngman was unmistakably Neapolitan.  His glossy black hair clusteredtight over his forehead; his brown skin shone as if rubbed with oil;his eyes danced like merry, but sinister, bits of coal, and his toored lips were continuously, loosely, patterned to a smile that wasmore nearly contemptuous than good-humored.For at least a part of every evening this Italian, who always enteredthe house from the rear and without the formality of knocking, sat inthe kitchen, drinking his beer with infinite leisure and, in theintervals of her discussions in the parlor, condescended to talk,lazily, with Rose.\"Who is he?\" asked Violet, on what was perhaps the fifth of hisvisits that she had happened to observe.Celeste, to whom the question had been addressed, shrugged her smoothshoulders.\"He ees Angel,\" she answered.\"He don\\'t look like one.\"\"No, not mooch, but hees name, eet ees that: Rafael Angelelli.  Eefhe had the moostache, he would be almost \\'andsome.\"\"Rose acts like she thought a good deal of him as he is.\"\"But why not?\"--Celeste raised her heavy brows.  \"\\'e ees \\'ersweed\\'eart.\"\"He is?\" repeated Violet, who could not yet understand the masculinelover that would batten upon his conquest.  \"I notice he prettynearly lives here, an\\' he never pays out a cent, an\\' never seems towork at anything, an\\' he always wears good clothes.\"\"My child, truly!  That is the reason that I have tol\\' you: \\'e ees\\'er sweed\\'eart.\"\"Well, it\\'s queer,\" said Violet, remembering another caller to whom,though he was a less frequent visitor, Rose was equally attentive.\"I don\\'t think he\\'s half as nice as that fellow who comes here in ataxi--the one that always wears a dress-suit an\\' sits in the backparlor.  He\\'s a swell.\"But at this Celeste grew enigmatic.\"Oh,\" she said, \"that ees deeferent\"--and would say no more.Nevertheless, it happened, not long afterward, when the black Cassiewas absent on her \"evening out,\" that Violet, descending the backstair in unshod feet to steal from the ice-chest--as was hercompanions\\' custom--a quiet bottle of the beer that she had come tolike, was brought to a palpitating stop by the sound, just then, ofRose\\'s and Angel\\'s voices from the kitchen but a few steps below her.The pair were plainly engaged in an important conversation, the womanhurried and frightened, the man cold and obdurate.\"Naw,\" said the Neapolitan; \"I maka naw move out o\\' deesa house.\"\"But he\\'s coming in now, I tell you,\" Rose almost supplicated.\"He\\'ll be in the back-parlor in half a minute, an\\' I\\'ve got to go inan\\' talk to him.\"\"Olla righta; you go; I go alonga you.\"\"You can\\'t do that; you know you can\\'t.  You know how things arewithout my tellin\\' you.  What makes you so stubborn all of a sudden?\"\"I don\\' lika dees Meesta Wesley Dyker.\"\"That\\'s no reason why you should double-cross me.\"\"\\'E\\'s too mucha de fina gentleman.\"\"I don\\'t care what he is; you ought to know what I am.  Do you wantto tear up your own meal-ticket and throw down your easy money?\"\"Easy mon\\'?  You maka de joke!\"The woman\\'s voice noticeably changed.\"Do you mean you want some more coin?\" she asked.The Italian did not answer.\"Because I won\\'t give it to you,\" Rose continued, anger darting intoher still cautiously lowered voice.  \"I know what you\\'re doing withit.  I know you had a girl from a department store out at shows twicelast week, an\\' the second time she had a new dress on.\"Somewhere in the front of the house a door closed heavily.\"\\'E\\'s comin\\',\" the Italian coolly commented.  \"Do you wanta that I goalong in with you?\"As quickly as it had entered, all the anger fled from Rose\\'s voice,and Violet, accustomed to it in command or at satisfied ease, wasamazed now to hear it swaying between terror and genuine affection.\"I didn\\'t mean it!\" Rose pleaded.  \"I didn\\'t believe it when I heardit an\\' I don\\'t believe it now, I know how much it costs a fellow tolive.  Here\\'s another ten-spot.  I--I--you know how I hate Dyker, andAngel, you know that I love you!\"The listener heard Angelelli rise and heard even his voice soften,though probably less with affection than with gratification.\"Now you talka lika de person witha gooda sense,\" he said.  \"Don\\' youlisten to de beega lie no more.  I lika you--nobody but only you.You are de gooda girl.\"There was a whispered word more, and then the kitchen door was softlyshut and Violet heard Rose, going into the next room, welcome thatWesley Dyker who, Violet had, to Celeste, so favorably compared withAngel.The woman on the stairs hesitated.  She wanted to pursue hereavesdropping, and she knew that she could regain her room, shouldthe doorbell ring, before she was likely to be missed; but she wasafraid that, in the maid\\'s absence, Rose might return to the kitchenfor a bottle of wine and discover her.  Accordingly she waited thefew minutes that were required for the first of such errands, and,those over, crept forward to the lighted keyhole, ready to retreat atthe first intimation of danger.She gave her eye precedence over her ear, and, as it chanced thatDyker was sitting directly in the limited shaft of her vision, shewas enabled to get what was her first careful view of him.A man but little beyond thirty, Wesley Dyker\\'s face, which might oncewell have been handsome, was beginning to show that flaccid whitenesswhich must later light to red and glow to purple.  What his mouthmight have told, a crisp, short, brown mustache concealed, but theregularity of his other features lost much of its effect because ofeyes that, though large and steel gray, were heavy-lidded andcalculating.  Nevertheless, Violet\\'s estimate of the man was notwithout justification.  He spoke easily and well in the voice ofeducation; his excellently made evening clothes displayed a figurethat had not yet lost its admirable lines, and even the face--to onethat either had known it during its gradual changes, or to one thatlacked a fund of experience for purposes of comparison--was notwanting in attraction.To the sturdy Rose, whose hand he held and who was looking at himwith what she patently believed to be a tender expression, he wasspeaking with a certain formal politeness that was novel in the earsof the listener.\"You think you can get it?\" Rose was asking.\"I think that I have something more than a fighting chance,\" repliedDyker.\"What does O\\'Malley say?\"\"He is at least as liberal in his promise to me as he is in hispromise to the other man.\"\"And the big chief doesn\\'t yip?\"\"My dear Rose, you should know, by this time, enough of New Yorkpolitics to realize that the first qualification of a big boss is tohold his tongue, and that the present incumbent, whatever his othershortcomings, can always keep quiet as long as he has no pen in hishand.\"Rose freed her hand to pour the wine.\"May I smoke?\" asked Dyker.\"You always ask me that, and you always know you can.\"He bowed and, drawing a cigarette from a plain gun-metal case,lighted it.\"Of course,\" he pursued, \"I expect to win--I always expect to win,because failure may fight its way to a perch on any man\\'s banner, butit\\'s sure to lodge on the standard of the man that sits and waits forit.  But I can\\'t be sure of O\\'Malley.\"\"I guess whatever headquarters orders will go with him, all right.\"\"On the surface, perhaps; but, if he wants to, he can have his owncandidate run on an independent ticket, and then he can quietly knifeme at the polls.\"\"Would he have the nerve?\"\"It is precisely what he did election before last.  I am sure ofthat, and yet nobody has ever been able to prove it.  That is where Ilook for your help.\"Rose took his hand again, and pressed it reassuringly.\"I always take care of my friends,\" she smiled, \"and you sure havebeen good to me.  Where do I come in on this game?\"\"Just yet you don\\'t have to come in at all.  It may be thateverything will be honest and above-board--I trust it will--and inthat case you need not disturb yourself.\"\"But if it ain\\'t?\"\"If it isn\\'t,\"--he looked at her kindly, but keenly, from under hisheavy lids--\"I shall want you to let me know just as soon as O\\'Malleybegins to make preparations for registering voters from this house.\"Rose bent forward and kissed him lightly on his flaccid cheek.\"That\\'s easy,\" she laughed.\"Perhaps, but if you have to go so far at first, you will have to gofarther afterward.\"\"An\\' now?\"\"Just now I want you to keep your ears open for gossip.  You are in aposition to hear a lot: in this house men talk that are dumb outside.\"\"Who are you thinkin\\' of?\"\"Several people, friends of O\\'Malley\\'s.  There\\'s one cheap littlecamp-follower who, I am told, gets around here rather frequently.  Idon\\'t suppose that he\\'s of enough importance to know much, but hewould be worth watching.\"\"What\\'s his name?\"Dyker filled Rose\\'s glass, and poured more wine for himself.\"Angelelli,\" he answered.From the darkened kitchen, Violet, her eye now fast to the keyhole,drew a short breath, and watched Rose as the sophisticated spectatorwatches an emotional actress when she approaches her \"big scene.\"But Rose, still the primitive Teuton of the brewery-calendar, neverquavered.\"Rafael Angelelli?\" she inquired.\"I think so.  He is a little Italian loafer with no work and plentyof money.  You know him, of course?\"\"Sure I know him.  He\\'s in an\\' out of here all the time.  We call him\\'Angel\\'.\"\"Hum.  Well, there are angels and angels, so that name may fit him aswell as any other.  There may be nothing to it, but he does hangabout O\\'Malley a good deal, and it might be worth your while to findout what, if anything, he knows.\"\"That\\'s easy,\" purred Rose.  \"Here\\'s success.\"The pair clinked their glasses, and drained them.\"And--Rose?\" began Dyker.\"Yes?\"\"Neither this little fellow nor any of his crowd knows about--us?\"Rose\\'s placid smile was eminently convincing.\"I guess I know my business,\" she said.\"I dare say you do.  Only don\\'t let him know that you know mine.\"\"Trust me for that, Wes\\' dear.\"\"Because, if O\\'Malley could get hold of it, he would have a ratherformidable weapon.\"\"He doesn\\'t know I ever set my lamps on you.\"\"Good,\" said Dyker; \"and he mustn\\'t know it for a good many months tocome.  Now, then, let\\'s have just one pint more between us--only apint--my dear--and----\"But the woman at the keyhole waited to hear no more.IXTHE COURT OF A MERCHANT-PRINCEWhen that injudicious grasping of the third-rail had snuffed out thelow, but stubborn, flame that a foreman had known as \"Number 12,\" anda few score of human beings had called Michael Flanagan, his wife,Bridget, had looked up from her washtub long enough to refuse theoffer of a hundred dollars, made by the company\\'s claim-adjuster asfull payment for whatever inconvenience she might have beenoccasioned by her husband\\'s demise.  One of those very modern younglawyers, whose livelihood depends upon their study of the newspapers,and the speed of their feet, had arrived at the Flanagan tenementahead of the adjuster.  He had accepted a contingent fee of tendollars, and thereafter, being defeated by the company\\'s expertattorneys in a lower court, refused, as usual, to appeal unless thewidow handed him a further amount of money that was wholly beyond herreach.  So Irish-eyed Katie was put to work, as she should in anycase have been put, and Mrs. Flanagan went on with her washing.The girl\\'s first position was in a second-hand clothing shop on SixthAvenue, where she went to work at eight in the morning and quit athalf-past ten at night.  The stock-in-trade of this place was largelyrevived ball-gowns and opera cloaks, bought, for the most part, fromwomen of so much means as to pretend, at least, that they never worethe same gown twice, and yet of too much thrift to give theirdiscarded clothes to charity.  Its patrons were persons that theoriginal wearers of the gowns would have blushed to meet.  And itsproprietress was a little lynx-eyed, hook-nosed person whose soleobject in life was to induce the former class to sell for less thanthey had intended and to persuade the latter class to buy for morethan they could afford.The virtue of this method she impressed, by precept and example, uponher six girl-clerks, and she raised their profits as they raisedtheir prices of sale.  She told, with a fine pride, how she had onceso conducted a negotiation that a Riverside Drive husband had paidher nearly as much for a dress that he was buying for a Forty-seventhStreet acquaintance as he had first paid for the same dress when itwas made for his wife.But, commissions to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Katie norher companions could earn anything beyond a bare living wage.  Thelure of clothes was always before them; their work was the handlingand the praising of beautiful fabrics beautifully arranged.  Theywere told that they might themselves buy of these at what theproprietress called a mere nothing above the cost price, but what wasreally a considerable increase over it; they wanted to look theirbest among their friends, and their employer insisted that they looktheir best to her patrons; there was not one of the half-dozen clerksthat was not continually from fifteen to a hundred dollars in hermistress\\'s debt.That Katie, like many another making the same fight, escaped furthercontamination, that the contrast between the oppression of thehook-nosed owner on the one hand and the apparent ease and luxury ofher customers on the other, did not tempt her,--for opportunitieswere plenty,--from the station of clerk to purchaser, was due in partto her own sturdy character and to the accident of her own Celtictemper.  Other girls there were who were not so destined, but Mrs.Flanagan\\'s weary feet one day refused to support their possessor, andKatie, knowing well the need of ready money for the doctor and thedruggist, neglected to purchase, even on credit, an expensive blackwalking-suit that was repeatedly called to her attention.\"Say, you\\'d look just grand in this,\" said the psittacidicproprietress, Mrs. Binks.She held the dress extended, putting its best points to the light.And all the other clerks echoed:\"You\\'d look just grand in it, Miss Flanagan!\"\"I would that,\" replied Katie, who was as taciturn to her employer asshe was loquacious to everybody else.\"Why don\\'t you take it?\" asked Mrs. Binks.\"I don\\'t just like it,\" lied Katie.Mrs. Binks blinked her bead-like eyes.  That the girl\\'s reply couldbe true was inconceivable.\"Try it on,\" she suggested.\"Where\\'s the use?  I don\\'t want it.\"\"Oh, try it on anyway.\"\"I\\'ll be too busy, Mrs. Binks.  The customers \\'re startin\\' to pour inthis very minute.\"\"Then try it on at your lunch time.  I\\'ll leave it handy here, overthis chair.\"She did leave it there all day long.  Katie, whose one dress was now,in spite of endless feminine make-shifts, beginning to show wear, hadto go through her task with the baited hook constantly danglingbefore her.  Nevertheless, when the long-delayed closing hourarrived, the suit was just where Mrs. Binks had left it.  Katiecarefully abstained from touching it; she would not even put it away.\"What\\'s this?\" asked the mildly surprised owner, as she stumbled overthe garment.  \"I declare it\\'s that handsome walking-suit I wanted youto have, Miss Flanagan.\"Katie turned and regarded the neglected garment precisely as Mrs.Binks was regarding it.\"Well, well,\" she said, \"and is it, now?\"Her mistress looked at her, again blinking suspiciously.\"Did you try it on?\" she demanded.\"No.\"\"Why not?\"\"I don\\'t think I want it.\"\"It\\'s a fine suit.\"\"It\\'s grand.\"\"But you don\\'t want it?\"\"I don\\'t think I do.\"\"I told you that you could have it for a third off.\"\"I know you did that, Mrs. Binks, and it\\'s thank you I do for yourkindness.\"\"Hum--hum.  I\\'ll take off a dollar more--for you.\"\"Thank you, no, Mrs. Binks.  Good-night, Mrs. Binks.\"This sort of thing went on, with variations, for three days, at theend of which time Mrs. Binks, as she would have phrased theoccurrence, \"came right out with it\"; and for this ceremony she chosethat morning hour when the other girls in the shop had the greatestamount of leisure to observe what happened.\"Miss Flanagan,\" said she, marching up to the thoroughly preparedKatie, and peering hard into the serene Irish eyes of her selectedvictim, \"I like my clerks to look well.\"\"So I\\'ve been noticin\\',\" said Katie.\"An\\' I don\\'t like to speak about it when they don\\'t,\" continued Mrs.Binks.\"You\\'re just that tender-hearted!\"\"But if you girls don\\'t wear good clothes, my customers\\'ll think Idon\\'t treat you right.\"\"How could they now, Mrs. Binks?\"\"And,\" concluded Mrs. Binks, overlooking these interruptions in viewof the crushing climax she was approaching, \"as you\\'ve made up yourmind not to take the hints I\\'ve been givin\\' you, or the fine offersI\\'ve made you, I\\'ve got to say it plainly that you\\'re looking tooshabby to work any more for me.\"Katie smiled her warmest smile.\"Mrs. Binks,\" she replied, resorting again to prevarication, andpresenting the greedily seized money that she still owed heremployer, \"I\\'d begun to be afraid that maybe them was your feelin\\'s,an\\' so yesterd\\'y at lunch time I bought me the exact duplicate ofthat walking-suit you\\'ve been tryin\\' to thrust upon me--only I got itnext door an\\' for half your price.\"Saying this she had walked to the shallow closet in the fitting-room,taken down her hat and coat, put them on, sung \"Good-by\" to herconsternated fellow-workers, and strolled away forever from thatplace of employment.  She went smiling, but, instead of the curt wordthat she generally employed, she administered a hand-slap with heropen palm to a stranger that accosted her on her journey homeward.She got work, after some searching, in a candy shop on Eighth Street,but this she had to relinquish when her mother\\'s speedy illnessdeveloped into a brief and fatal disease.  It was not until the lastnursing, relieved by Hermann\\'s assistance, and the funeral were over,that she could again think of labor, and then it was only to get, ina Fourth Street necktie factory, a small position that she lostbecause she had the effrontery to resent the rather frank overturesof the foreman.Now, although she had told her cheerful lover nothing about it, shehad come to the last ditch.  She had been deceived by advertisements,cheated by employment agencies, denied work by the superintendents ofscores of shops and manufactories.  She was not a skilled laborer,and she had, at first, nothing in the matter of recommendation; shebelonged to no trade union; the rent for her little room wasdangerously overdue; so, also, were the bills of the baker and themilk dealer upon whom alone she was depending for food; all that shecould pledge was in pawn, and, with the soles of her shoes wornthrough almost to her feet, the elaborate mourning costume that shehad been unable to resist was her only badge of material prosperity.Two avenues of escape were open, were even persistently presented,yet she would regard neither.  To take what Hermann pleaded with herto accept, though her hungry heart and her underfed body cried outfor it, would have been, she felt well assured, unfairly to handicapher best friend, and, as for turning into that other way--a way intowhich the streets on every hand seemed so easily to open, she was toowise to consider.\"No thanks,\" she answered in her soul, as she walked by the leeringsatyrs, with her black head erect and her lips compressed--\"not yet,if you please: not yet, nor never, I think, for starvin\\' seems someeasier and a deal quicker, too.\"She had to repeat the words pretty often, for they had come to be asort of incantation, almost a pious ejaculation, against the enemy,and, as her poverty grew and her chances decreased in inverse ratio,the enemy, like vultures flocking to the fatally wounded, seemedstartlingly to increase in force.  At first it was a well-dressedcorps strayed from Broadway or the Avenue; then it was the bank-clerkhurrying to work and the master mechanic hurrying from it; butfinally, so plain are the signs of distress shown upon our faces bythe selves that are besieged, it had become the professionallyemploying, professedly unemployed.Yet at every dawn she renewed her quest, with a glass of blue milkand a bite of bread for breakfast.  Every day and all day she trampedthe long, aching streets.  And every night, despairing but resolute,she came home for her supper of bread and milk and for the sleep ofthe hungry and distressed.It was now a Thursday morning.  The milkman had pounded at her doorand, receiving no answer, had left no milk.  Still gnawing her crust,Katie slunk out of the tenement, and, at the step, was waylaid by therent-collector, a little man with a sharp, white face that toldplainly of his own struggle.  He blocked the exit.\"Good-day to you, Miss Flanagan,\" he said, touching his dirty cap.\"Good-mornin\\', Mr. Woods,\" she answered, aware that the hour for thelast engagement was approaching.The man was one whose business forced him to mince nothing.\"I was comin\\' up to git yer rent,\" he continued.  \"It\\'s three weeksoverdue.\"\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to be askin\\' you to let it run a bit longer,\"said Katie, and her voice, in spite of all resolution, trembled.\"But I\\'ve been an\\' done that twice fer you, Miss Flanagan.  The bossis after me as hard as I\\'m after you--an\\' harder.\"\"I know it.  I--you can\\'t stand him off another week, Mr. Woods?\"\"Nix on the stand-off, miss.\"\"You see, I\\'m--I\\'m out of a job.\"\"I know that, but then you\\'ve been out o\\' one fer a good while now.\"\"Yes, only I rather expect--indeed, I\\'ve been promised one beginnin\\'to-morrow.\"The little man coughed behind a dirty hand.\"That\\'s Friday?\" he asked.\"It is that.\"\"Well, ain\\'t you got your dates mixed?  You told me last week you hada job promised for that Friday.\"Katie surprised even herself: she laughed.\"So I did!\" she said.  \"An\\' of course I was lyin\\' an\\' of course youknowed it.  Oh, well, Woods, man, hold \\'em off for forty-eight hours,an\\' if I don\\'t get work then, I\\'ll--well, I won\\'t bother you no more.\"In the shadowy hallway, she felt his eyes studying her less with evilthan with wonder.\"There ain\\'t many girls with your looks, Miss Flanagan, as\\'d be outof a job as long as you\\'ve been.\"Katie shrugged her shoulders: she was beyond resentment.\"The more pity to \\'em,\" she said.\"Not many,\" repeated Mr. Woods.There was an awkward silence.  The collector paused because he wantedher fully to weigh an implication that he honestly considered tocontain sound advice, and Katie refrained from further comment forthe excellent reason that she had nothing to say.  It was Woods thatat last took up the broken thread.\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do, Miss Flanagan,\" he not unkindlyconcluded; \"I\\'ll hold \\'em off till to-morrow evenin\\', an\\' if by thenyou can pay me a chunk on account, it\\'ll be all right; if youcan\\'t----\"He stood aside, and Katie clapped him warmly on the shoulder.\"You\\'re doin\\' your best, Woods,\" she said, \"an\\' I thank you for it.I\\'ll get the job someways, but not the way you think, an\\'--an\\' Ithank you.\"Only half-way to the corner she met the girl that lived across thehall from her, Carrie Berkowicz, a homely, round-cheeked,brown-haired Lithuanian Jewess, who worked in a shirtwaist factory onTenth Street.\"Say, Katie\"--Carrie prided herself on her colloquial English, as shelearned it in the night-classes in the Rand School--\"were you stilllooking for a job?\"Katie nodded.\"Well, say, I just this minute passed Emma Schrem, an\\' she says CoraCostigan is quitting her job at the Lennox store to-day to be marriedto-morrow.  Why don\\'t you pull up there and try for it?\"Try for it?  Katie could scarcely stop to thank her rescuer beforeshe had turned northward.  There was no longer left her even the fivecents necessary for carfare, and, though she was faint with hungerand shaking with fear lest her tardiness should lose her this slimopportunity, she was forced to walk.  Facing a fine rain blown infrom the Sound, she walked up Second Avenue, and finally, turningwestward to the shopping quarter now crowded with salesgirls on theirhurried way to work, she entered, by the dark employés\\' door, thelarge department-store of Joshua N. Lennox, merchant andphilanthropist.A dozen quick inquiries rushed her, wet and weary, but flushed by herwalk and radiant with the excitement of the race, into the presenceof the frock-coated, pale-faced, suave-mouthed Mr. Porter, the tall,thin man, with the precision of a surgeon and the gravity of aSunday-school superintendent, to whose attention, it appeared, suchpleas as hers must be brought.  Mr. Porter, who had grayside-whiskers, which he stroked with white hands, listened injudicial calm to what she had to say.\"Just fill out this application-blank,\" he remarked as, breathless,Katie ended her little speech.They were in a dim, bare office under the street, the man at aroll-top desk lighted by a green-shaded incandescent lamp, the girlstanding beside him.  Mr. Porter indicated a writing-shelf along theopposite wall, where Katie found a pile of the blanks, and pen andink.  While she struggled with the task assigned her, Mr. Porterverified, by brief, sharp inquiries through a telephone, herstatement of the approaching marriage of Miss Cora Costigan.Katie, meanwhile, was giving her age, her parentage, her birthplace,the name of the firm that had last employed her--she mentioned thecandy-shop for that,--was cheerfully agreeing to join the \"Employés\\'Mutual Benefit Association,\" and was putting a \"Yes,\" which sheintended promptly to forget, to the question that asked her to becomea spy on her co-workers: \"If you saw a fellow-employé doing anythingdetrimental to the interests of the firm, would you consider it yourduty to report the same?\"  It was only at one of the last questionsthat she hesitated.\"Please what does that mean?\" she asked.Mr. Porter deigned to walk across the room and, close to hershoulder, examined the question.  It was the simple one: \"Do you livewith your parents?\"\"That,\" said Mr. Porter, \"is inserted because the firm wishes to haveonly nice girls here, and those with good home influences areconsidered--most trustworthy.\"Mr. Porter had the type of emotionless eyes that can say one sort ofthing far better than the eyes of more temperamental people, and henow met Katie\\'s steady gaze with a stare of considerable significance.Katie was rather sure that she understood.\"So that,\" she said, \"if I didn\\'t live with my people, I couldn\\'thave the job?\"\"So that,\" Mr. Porter corrected, \"if a girl does get a position andlives with her family, she will be better cared for, and we will knowthat she is safe at home evenings.\"Katie hesitated no longer.  She took the pen and, opposite the query,wrote a quick \"Yes.\"  To be sure she was, on that account, obliged toinvent the kind of work done by her father and the amount of thefamily wage; but she so needed the position that her active wit atonce supplied the answers.  More or less truthfully, she put a wordin reply to the remaining questions, signed her name, and wrote heraddress.Mr. Porter took the paper in his white fingers, read it slowly,folded it, indorsed it with several hieroglyphics, and placed it in apigeon-hole.\"I am filing this with our other applications,\" he said.  \"As soon asyour name is reached, I will see that you are notified.\"Katie\\'s jaw dropped.\"But I thought,\" she began, \"I thought I was to get the job now.I--isn\\'t Cora leavin\\', thin, after all?\"\"Miss Costigan is leaving us, I understand,\" said Mr. Porter,stroking his whiskers; \"but there are others--nearly a hundred--onthe list ahead of you.\"Katie was hungry, and hunger finds it hard to think of justice.  Shehad borne all that she could bear.  The waiting, the walking, thehope and the hopelessness had gnawed the string of her courage.Something snapped inside of her, and she began to sob with Irishunrestraint.Mr. Porter was embarrassed.  He frequently had to deal harshly withother employés of his philanthropic employer--it was, in fact, uponthe performance of such duties that his living almost depended--buthe did not like to have tears shed in his office: it did not lookwell for the reputation of the establishment.\"My dear Miss--Miss Flanagan,\" said he, first consulting theapplication-blank for the forgotten name, and putting one of hiswhite hands toward the face now hidden in a crumpled handkerchief.\"You mustn\\'t--really, you must not!\"\"But everything depends on me gettin\\' this job!\" sobbed Katie in anIrish wail.  \"The rent\\'s due; me family\\'s all sick; the milkman won\\'tleave no more milk, an\\' I\\'ve eaten nothin\\' for Heaven knows how long!\"In a rush of words her story, including that of her resurrectedfather, leaped from her.  What effect it would have had upon Mr.Porter had it been calmly told is beyond guessing; but it was told byno means calmly, and Katie\\'s voice rose to a pitch that forced him tosurrender out of mere fear of a prolonged scene.  Grudgingly, butunconditionally, he laid down his arms.  He took the telephone andcalled again Miss Isaacs, the buyer of the women\\'s hosierydepartment, which Miss Costigan was to leave on the following day,told as much of Katie\\'s story as he thought necessary, and obtainedconsent to a trial of the girl.  He informed Katie that she mighttake, on the next morning, the place to be vacated by Miss Costigan,but he took care to impress upon her mind the fact that he was doingher an exceptional favor, which she was not to mention to herfriends, who might try to profit by her unusual experience.Katie was on the point of calling all the saints to bless him whenshe bethought her of a practical inquiry theretofore, in hereagerness to secure any sort of work, neglected.\"An\\' what\\'s the pay?\" she inquired.\"You will receive,\" replied Mr. Porter in the tones in which hisemployer announced the gift of a small fortune to a large college,\"four dollars and fifty cents a week.\"Katie forgot the saints.\"Four--\" she began.  \"But, Mr. Porter,\" she concluded, \"will you betellin\\' me how I\\'m to be livin\\' on all that?\"Mr. Porter\\'s calm eyes came again into significant play.\"You have said in your application, you may recall,\" he drylyremarked, as he reached for that document, \"you have said that youlived with your father.\"For a moment her glance probed his.\"But for all that,\" she said, \"I have to support meself entirely.\"Mr. Porter was still looking at her with his emotionless, appraisinggaze.  He saw a girl with pretty, piquant features, with glossy blackhair, with cheeks that bloomed even in privation and blue eyes thatwere beautiful even in tears.\"Miss Flanagan,\" said he, \"most of the girls that start at thesewages in department-stores are partly supported by their family orhave some friend to help them out.\"Katie flushed, but she kept her outward calm.\"An\\' what if they haven\\'t got a friend?\" she inquired.Porter\\'s cold eye never wavered.\"They find one,\" he said; \"and I may add, Miss Flanagan, that youshould experience no difficulty in that direction.\"Poverty will do much for most of us.  For Katie it succeeded incurbing a temper that, in better times, was never docile.  Beggars,she reflected, cannot afford to look too closely into the source orsignificance of the alms they have asked.  She swallowed her wrath.\"Will you advance one week\\'s salary now?\" she asked.Mr. Porter was distinctly surprised.\"I--why, certainly I won\\'t!\" he stammered.\"Why not?\"\"But, my dear Miss Flanagan, I have nothing to do with the payment ofthe salaries.  Besides, this firm doesn\\'t know you; it does not evenknow that you will come to-morrow; it does not know that, if you docome, you will remain.\"Katie smiled insidiously, and Katie smiling through her tear-curledlashes was insidious indeed.\"Och, now, Mr. Porter,\" she protested.  \"That\\'s all well enough forthe green girls; but you an\\' I know that you\\'re the boss in mattersof this sort.  Lend me two an\\' a quarter.\"Mr. Porter, pleased in spite of himself by her flattery, protested,but Katie remained unconvinced.  She declared that she knew he wasthe real authority and that she could not bear to hear himunderestimate himself.  And the upshot of the discussion was that,though Mr. Porter could, in his official capacity, do nothing sounbusinesslike as to make her an advance, he would, personally, beglad to oblige her with a dollar and a half, and oblige her, adding afatherly pat to her pink cheek, he ultimately did.\"Thanks,\" Katie responded as she took the money, and turned to go.\"I\\'ll report to-morrow, then, at a quarter of eight, Mr. Porter.\"\"At quarter to eight,\" repeated Mr. Porter, slowly closing the doorbehind her.But, out in the wet street, Katie was saying what she had refrainedfrom saying in the darkened office.\"An\\' as for the pay,\" she concluded, \"I can\\'t buy no automobiles withme loose change; but I think you\\'ll find, you limb of Satan, that Ican keep body an\\' soul together without a friend in the wor\\'rld!\"XANOTHER SPHEREThat same evening, his crisp brown mustache hiding the meaning of hismouth, and his drooping lids concealing the purpose of his steel-grayeyes, Wesley Dyker, from the rooms he had rented in an East SideAssembly district, took a cab northwestward through the rain toRiverside Drive.  He was dressed precisely as he dressed to go to thehouse of Rose Légère, but he was bound for the house of Joshua Lennox.There he had plainly been expected.  The liveried, tight-lippedservant, who opened the iron grill-work door for him, showed himdeferentially down a long tiled hall and into, not the formal whiteand gilt reception-room, but a comfortable, dimly-lighted apartment,a smoking-room, hung with fading mediæval tapestries, the floorcovered with deep rugs of the Orient, and the chairs wide,broad-armed, and upholstered in soft leather.\"Miss Lennox will be down in a moment, sir,\" said the servant.  \"MayI bring you anything, Mr. Dyker?\"Wesley shook his well-shaped head.\"No, thank you, Charles,\" he answered, and then, nodding to adecanter that, under a wide, soft-shaded lamp, stood upon a cornertable: \"Irish?\" he asked.Charles bowed, brought a tray, and, when Dyker had poured thewhiskey, added some seltzer, and lighted the cigarette that the guesthad taken from a wrought silver box on a nearby tabouret.\"That is all, Charles,\" said Dyker, and the servant silently left himalone.Wesley sank back in his chair with a sigh of comfort.  He liked thehouse of the philanthropic merchant so well that he could have wishedits master liked him better, and when, within a few minutes, themaster himself chanced into the room, Dyker was prepared to bediplomatic.Joshua N. Lennox was the explanation of that Mr. Porter who held somuch power under him.  The latter was tall and thin, the former shortand compact, but there all physical differences ended: Mr. Porter hadfound his model in his employer.  Here was the source of theseneschal\\'s gray hair and side-whiskers, his trap mouth tortured tothe line of benevolence, his calm gaze and his manner that combinedthe precision of the surgeon with the gravity of the head of aSunday-school.  Mr. Lennox, in fact, conducted the second largestBible Class in New York.  He knew its textbook from the first chapterof Genesis to the twenty-second chapter of the Revelation, and hebelieved in the literal inspiration of every verse of the originaland of every syllable of the English translation.It was in the voice in which he habitually addressed his Bible Class,the voice of one uttering a benediction, that he said:\"Good-evening, Mr. Dyker.\"Wesley put down his glass and rose to his feet.The man before him was the perfection of that noble work of Heaven, aProminent Citizen.  Joshua Lennox endowed Bowery chapels with organsand meat-supplies; he contributed heavily to missions among thebenighted Japanese; he assisted in arbitrating strikes wherein hisfellow-employers were concerned; he always served on memorialcommittees; and he regularly subscribed to the campaign funds of allmovements toward municipal political reform.If his climbing wife insisted upon having liquor in the house, Mr.Lennox never touched it.  If she served tobacco, he did not smoke.If she took in a Sunday paper, written and printed on Saturday, hewould read no news until the appearance of the Monday journal merelywritten and printed on Sunday.  And if his mercantile establishmentsold poker-chips under the pseudonym of \"counters,\" he was aware onlythat it did not sell playing-cards.  The business he considered ashis creation had grown beyond the limits of his power, and though, agood man and sincere, he might have done something by keeping acloser eye upon his work, he was in reality as much the creature ofconditions as his worst-paid cash-boy.  The great Frederickcomplained that a monarch could not know all the evil done in hiskingdom: Joshua Lennox was so busy benefiting mankind that he had noleisure to observe in his own shop the state of affairs that made hisphilanthropy financially possible.\"I hope you are going with us to the opera, Mr. Lennox,\" said Dyker.The old man shook his silvered head.\"No,\" said he in the slow, deliberate utterance that he had acquiredwith his first million of dollars; \"I am on my way farther down townthan that.\"\"But you had better come,\" urged Wesley, knowing that refusal wascertain.  \"This is the last performance of the season.\"\"On the contrary,\" the merchant chuckled kindly, \"I think you hadbetter let Marian go to the opera alone and come along with me.  I amgoing to the first performance of a new season.\"\"Where\\'s that?\"\"To the Municipal Improvement Mass Meeting at Cooper Union.\"That made it Dyker\\'s turn to smile.\"Oh, but I couldn\\'t do that,\" he said.  \"I\\'m on the other side, youknow.\"\"Against good government?\"  The elder man manifestly enjoyed thismild thrust.\"Against irregularity, Mr. Lennox.  There never has been and therenever can be any lasting reform from the outside.  We must clean ourown houses.  That is why I have moved to my present address.  Ibelieve in reform from within the party, and I believe that to effectthis we want men of your sort to help us indoors and not to attack usfrom the street.\"The merchant\\'s cold eye looked hard at the speaker, but Dyker\\'slowered lids betrayed nothing.\"Yes,\" replied Lennox, dryly; \"I heard that when Tammany Hall firstcame into power, but I have never seen any trace of reform from theinside.  What I have seen is the spectacle of most of these insidereformers developing into leaders of the machine.  If you will takean older man\\'s advice, you will withdraw while there is yet time.\"Wesley\\'s reply sprang ready to his lips, but, before he could utterit, Marian Lennox came into the room.Something of herself the girl received, no doubt, from her climbingmother; something, probably, from her satisfied father, and more thanshe guessed from a narrow environment.  Nevertheless, four years atcollege had cultivated in her what seemed to be a spirit ofindependence, and a brief life in the city had confirmed in her whatshe was certain were opinions of her own.She was tall and moved with assurance.  Her full throat rose abovethe ermine of her cloak, supporting a delicately carved head, thehead of a Greek cameo, held rigidly erect.  The hair was a richchestnut, the eyes large and brown, and the mouth at once firm andkindly.  Her skin was very fair and her gloved hands long and slender.She caught her father\\'s concluding words.\"While there is yet time,\" she paraphrased, \"Mr. Dyker will withdrawfrom this room and get me to the opera-house before the overture hasended.  I am so unfashionable as to want my music entire.\"She was used to commanding her parents in their own house, and shethought that she was used to commanding Wesley everywhere, so thatshe dismissed Lennox and secured Dyker\\'s entrance into her waitinglimousine with almost no delay whatever.\"There,\" she remarked as she settled herself comfortably for theirdrive; \"I rather fancy that I rescued you from a sermon.\"Dyker laughed shortly.\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" he said.  \"I esteem your father so much that Ishould like him to like me.\"\"But you think that he doesn\\'t like you?\"\"I think that he is slow to see that two persons may differ on aquestion of political tactics and yet remain, both of them, honestmen.\"\"And may they?\" bantered Marian.\"Well,\" he lightly accepted the challenge, \"I shall take the specificcase.  There is no doubting your father\\'s sincerity; there is nodoubting the sincerity of nearly all the men that will, with him,to-night try to launch another of these municipal-reform partieswhich, if they ever get started at all, are sure to run on the rocksat last.\"\"And on the other hand,\" said the girl, \"I suppose I must generouslyrefuse to doubt the sincerity of Tammany Hall?\"\"On the other hand you must justly refuse to doubt the sincerity of afew young men who have seen that reform-parties always end in violentreaction within the city and, if briefly successful, weaken the partyin the next national campaign.  You must refuse to doubt thesincerity of these young men when they go into the heart of the EastSide to live and work among the people that make up theorganization\\'s fighting-strength.  You must believe in them when theytry to get nominated for even the smallest offices on themachine-ticket.  And you must have faith that, if they can workthemselves at last into places of power, they will reform the partyin the only way that will keep it reformed.\"\"Dear me,\" sighed Marian, \"it seems that it was father that I rescuedfrom a sermon.\"\"Well,\" said Dyker, \"you asked me why your father and I should notmistrust each other, and there you have the reason.  You know what Iam trying to do; I have told you my plans as I haven\\'t told them toanother human being--and you should know that I am not to besuspected.\"There was a ring in his voice that touched her.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she said.  \"I beg you\\'ll forgive me.  Only really, youknow, you can\\'t expect father to be with you: he would have to breakthe habit of a lifetime.\"\"I don\\'t ask him to be with me; I only ask him to believe that a mancan work with the organization and yet have pure principles.\"\"He can\\'t even go so far as that; he says that every system is thereflection of the men that make it, and he says that the system yousupport battens on horrors.\"\"But it can\\'t be the system.  The horrors existed long before thesystem.  Is he such a conservative as not to be able to see that?\"\"He isn\\'t a conservative; he is the one unprogressive thing innature: the liberal of a preceding generation.  Only the other day Imentioned something I have been thinking about doing--something thatseveral of my most conventional friends have been doing for ever solong--and he was so dreadfully shocked that, though I\\'m now resolvedupon my course, I can\\'t guess how he\\'ll take it.\"Dyker\\'s curiosity was easily piqued.\"If you proposed it,\" he said, \"I can\\'t imagine that it was such avery terrible thing.\"\"Oh, no; it was merely that I want to be of some use in the world andso have made up my mind to go in for settlement-work.\"Wesley Dyker was one of those rare animals, a human being whoseparents, though they could have arranged it otherwise, permitted himto be born in New York.  He had been reared, at least during thewinters of his earlier life, within the Borough of Manhattan, and hisviews were, like those of most of his even less acclimated neighbors,just as wide as that narrow island, and no wider.  Indeed, so far aswere concerned his views of the proper sphere of his own womankind,he limited them entirely to an extremely small portion of the city.\"Of course you\\'re joking,\" he said.\"I am in cold earnest,\" she assured him.\"But that\\'s absurd.  You\\'ve--why you don\\'t know what settlement-workmeans!\"\"I know quite well what it means,\" said Marian.  \"I have friendsengaged in it, as I told you, and I\\'ve been visiting them and seeingtheir life at close quarters.\"\"And you really mean----\"\"I really mean that here we are at the Metropolitan, and that wecan\\'t talk on our way upstairs, and we won\\'t talk while there ismusic to listen to.\"Slowly their car had taken its grudged place in a long procession ofits fellows, one by one unloading the human freight before thebrilliantly lighted doorway.  The pavement and the steps were atossing sea of silk hats, colored scarfs, and glittering headdresses.Into this they plunged, hurried to the crowded elevator, traversed alighted corridor, passed through a short, dark passage and came outto the Lennox box in the great, glaring horseshoe of the opera-house.Dyker, baffled by the sudden stop that had been put to his protests,looked moodily upon the familiar picture.  Below them, climbing tothe rail behind which was massed the orchestra, was the pit, whitebosoms and bare shoulders, too distant to present, to the unassistedeye, any hint of individuality.  Above rose the teeming galleries,line above line of peering faces.  And to right and left swept thegreat curve of the boxes splendid with lace and feathers and jewels.He saw no more than that during the entire performance and, asMarian, even in the _entr\\'actes_, would talk of nothing but the musicto which he had refused to listen, he heard less.  The opera was\"Lucia,\" and as Wesley, with a taste worthy of a more discerningcritic, considered that work nothing but a display of vocalgymnastics devised for a throat abnormally developed, he wouldprobably have been, in any case, bored.His father, who had what his friends called \"family,\" had marriedwhat everybody called \"money,\" but had managed to invest thatcommodity with a talent for choosing failures, and, when both parentshad died, Wesley, fresh from the Columbia Law School, had amazedlyfound himself in a position where he would actually have to turn hiseducation to practical account.  For five years he held a thankless,underpaid and unmentioned partnership in a well-known firm ofcorporation-lawyers.  He drew their briefs, and developed a genuinetalent for the task, but he was never given a chance to plead.  Theworm of necessity spun its cocoon in his brain, but the emergingbutterfly of ambition could find no way to liberty.One day, however, he was commissioned to prepare the case in defenseof a large contractor, quite justly accused of fraud.  It happenedthat, when the young lawyer brought the results of his week\\'s work tohis chief, the client in whose interests the work had been done wascloseted with the head of the firm, and, Dyker being presented, thatcontractor learned of Wesley\\'s service.  At the ensuing trial theclient was acquitted, and remembered the service.  He lived on theEast Side and made most of his money from political jobs.  The restfollowed simply enough.  Dyker was introduced to the powers of hispatron\\'s district, and, thinking that he saw here the opportunity ofwhich he had begun to despair, he had left his former employers andwas already shouldering his way forward among his new friends.  Hisformer acquaintances mildly wondered what the devil he was after; hislatter ones began to regard him as a clever fellow, and thenewspapers printed stories of him as a young society man thatgratuitously gave his legal talents to the help of the poor.For his own part, Dyker was quite certain of what he was and of whathe would be.  He had seen, beneath his lowered lids, that a cleverman could gain both fortune and power through political prestige, andhe meant to use that means to his end.  He had also, while still withthe firm of corporation-lawyers, been presented to Marian Lennox byher opportunely-met, socially-aspiring mother, and was, whatever hisrelation with other members of her sex, quite as much in love withher as he could be with anybody.  Realizing the power of her father\\'sfortune and the beauty of the girl herself, he had determined tomarry her with as little delay as possible.Until to-night he had delayed all open pursuit, because there had notbeen lacking signs to free him from fear of all male rivals; but thatMarian should thus suddenly develop a purpose in life meant that hewas to have a rival of a far more formidable sort.  He set his teethunder his crisp mustache, folded his arms across his heart, and satstolidly through the interminable opera: as soon as it was over, hemeant to play his first lead.He did play it--played it as soon as their car had crept up in answerto its electric-call and whisked them away into the night.  As theyshot up the flaming street, her clean-cut profile was almost asdistinct as it had been in the box, and the girl, still thrillingwith the memory of the music she so passionately loved, was close tothe mood best suited to his own.\"May I talk now?\" he asked ruefully.She smiled.\"You mean to ask if you may argue,\" she answered.  \"No, you may notargue against my determination, and I am a good deal surprised that aman of your sort should want to.\"\"I don\\'t intend to argue,\" he protested, leaning the merest trifletoward her.  \"I mean only to ask you if your determination is quitefixed.\"She bowed her splendid head.\"Quite fixed,\" she said.\"So that argument would not shake it?\"\"So that no argument could shake it.\"\"Nor any persuasion?\"His voice had sunk only a semi-tone, but her feminine ear noted thechange.\"Nor any persuasion,\" she replied.\"Then suppose I presented to you neither argument nor persuasion, buta condition?\"\"But there is no conceivable condition that could arise to change me.You refuse to understand that I see this thing as a duty.\"A lamp stronger than its fellows threw a quick ray full upon herface; her brown eyes were charmingly serious, her lips dangerouslysweet.\"What I understand,\" responded Dyker, \"is that there is one situationin which a woman may find herself where there arises a duty thatcrowds all others from the board.\"His hand, in the semi-darkness, sought and found her own, its glovewithdrawn, cool and firm and unretreating.\"You know the situation I mean,\" he said.  \"I love you.  I love youso much, Marian, that I am jealous of any work that would take youfrom me; I want so much of your love that I can spare none ofit--none even for the poor and suffering.\"In that tight grasp her hand fluttered a little, but she did notanswer: she could not answer, because, while her brain was tellingher that a love so rapacious was necessarily niggardly, her heart wascrying out that this was the love it wanted most of all.\"Marian\"--his voice shook now with the emotion that was tugging atits leash--\"you\\'ve known for some months that I loved you; all lastwinter you must have seen this coming; you can\\'t be unprepared toanswer me!\"He possessed himself of her other hand, and pressed her inert palmsbetween his own.But the girl\\'s determination loomed large to her.  Through her entirelife she had been shut away from the real world, behind rich curtainsand amid soft lights, until, fired with the unrest of a partialeducation, she had chanced upon a glimpse of classmates working inwhat they called the slums, and now, with all the enthusiasm ofyouth, she had resolved to join them.  A maturer woman would not havetaken so seriously a sudden impulse to engage in work for which shehad no training, but Marian was young.\"I am not unprepared,\" she answered.  \"I did know.  But I know toothat there are things that can make even love a finer, a betteremotion.\"The words reminded her of some speech she had once heard in a play,and, entirely in earnest as she was, the sound of them from her ownlips strengthened her.  She was in love with Wesley Dyker, but shewas more in love with renunciation.The man, however, shook his head.\"No,\" he said, \"love is something ultimate.  You can\\'t paint thelily; you can\\'t part it and share it; you must either cherish it orkill it.  Which do you mean to do?\"The car had turned into the smoother way of Riverside Drive, wherethe lights are far fewer and less bright than Broadway\\'s.  He couldnot see her face, but he could not doubt the resolve that was in hervoice as she answered:\"I mean to take up the work that I have told you of.\"\"But that\\'s folly, Marian!\"He had chosen the wrong term of description, and, the moment heuttered it, he knew that he had erred.  \"Folly\" is the word thatyouth most resents.Marian withdrew her hands.\"It is strange,\" she said, \"to hear you, of all men, laugh at anattempt to help the poor.\"\"I am not laughing; I\\'m too serious to laugh.  I am so serious that Ican\\'t pick and choose phrases.  I meant only that you can\\'t helpthese people without training----\"\"I can get training.\"\"Without knowing them?\"\"The only way to know them is to go to them.\"\"But even then, you can do so little.  These settlements accomplishpractically nothing.  They are fads for the people that run them andplaythings for the people they are intended to help.  I can speakwith authority, and I tell you that the young men and women, the boysand girls, that go to them, drop in only when they have nothing elseto do, and all the rest of the time go their own ways.\"He forgot that he had said he would not argue.  He used all his powerto convince and to persuade; but if there is one human being thatcannot be moved from a purpose, it is a young girl with a romanticideal, smarting under what she conceives to be ridicule, and for thefirst time tasting what she believes to be the bitter-sweets ofsacrifice.  Even when the verbal war had been carried into her ownhouse, he could bring no concession from her.  If he was helping hisneighbors, then he should be all the more anxious that she, as thewoman he wanted to be his wife, should have precisely the experiencethat the settlement would supply her.\"Then you mean,\" he asked, \"that you do care--that you care at leasta little?\"He put out his hands, but she did not seem to see them.\"I mean,\" she answered, \"that we must wait.\"XIUNDER THE LASHIt was on the day following her eavesdropping upon Rose that Violetwas awakened early--as early as eleven o\\'clock in the morning--by asudden cry.  The sound was one of some pain and more terror,beginning in the high note of horrified amazement and ending in anattenuating moan of despair.Violet had been living in a highly charged atmosphere: she sat up inbed, sleep immediately banished from her brain.  She remained stilland listened.  She heard Rose\\'s now familiar footstep.  She heard adoor open and close.  She heard that cry frightfully begin again, andthen she heard it more frightfully stop in mid-power, cease in abruptand hideous silence.There came a discreet tapping at her own door.\"Are you alone, my dear?\"It was the deep, contralto voice of English Evelyn, and, as Violetreplied in the affirmative, the woman softly entered.Her tall, almost thin, figure was draped in a soiled pink kimona; heryellow hair seemed merely to have been tossed upon her head and tohave been left precisely as it happened to alight; her blue eyes weredull, and her hard, narrow face, with its spots of high color overthe cheek-bones, showed more plainly than common, the usually faintlittle red veins that lay close below its white skin.\"My Gawd,\" she sighed, as she sank upon the bed and curled up at itsfoot, \"there are some things I can\\'t get accustomed to, andthat\"--she nodded in the direction whence the cry had come--\"that\\'sone of them.\"She spoke in a weary voice, a voice with almost no animation, butwith a curious mixture of the cockney of the New Yorker and with arising inflection that saved what she said from monotony.\"What was it?\" asked Violet.\"You ought to know.  It was another of them.\"\"You mean----\"  The question trailed into nothingness on Violet\\'swhitening lips.\"Yes,\" said Evelyn, seizing a pillow and snuggling her broadshoulders against it.  \"Got a cig?\"  And then, as her hostessproduced a box from under the mattress: \"It does so get upon mynerves.  Why, sometimes they come here young enough to play withdollies.  This time there was no more sleep for boiby.  Had to rundownstairs and rig a B. and S., and then come up to girlie here forcompany.\"\"How--how did this happen?\"\"How the deuce do you suppose?  One story is pretty much all of them,my dear, and one about as narsty as the others.\"\"But this?\"\"Oh, this broke me up just because I had the bad luck to hear thedetails, though I must say I\\'ve heard the same details often enoughbefore.  Her people lived in a tenement in Essex Street, where it\\'sso crowded that the men have to come outside every evening whiletheir wives cook the dinners--three nine-by-seven rooms, no barth andno privacy; four children from eighteen to ten in one room; pa, ma,the boiby, and the seven-year-old in the second, and the cot in thekitchen-living-room rented to the lodger.  The lodger was the wigglysnake under the apple-tree.\"\"He brought her here?\"\"Gave her, as you might say, the general directions.  But she\\'d havecome along of her own self sometime.\"\"How could she?\"\"How couldn\\'t she, you mean!  Those tenements are not for livingin--there isn\\'t room for that--they\\'re just to eat in, when you\\'vegot enough, and sleep in, when you can sleep, and die in, when youhave to.\"\"So this girl had to live outside?\"\"On the doorsteps and the roofs when it was hot, and walking up anddown the street when it wasn\\'t.\"Violet remembered her own home, and reflected that her excuse wasless, because her surroundings had been better.\"That must have been pretty bad,\" she said.\"It was bad, but it wasn\\'t so bad as being indoors, my dear.  That\\'swhat most girls think about it anyway, and that\\'s why they never gohome before ten or eleven.  How else do the moving-picture shows keeprunning and how else do the dance-halls make their cakes and ale?\"\"The dance-halls?\"  The word was new to Violet.\"Yes, my dear, I said the dance-halls--where you pay five cents todance in the dust, with the windows nailed fast to start a thirst,and then buy you bad beer of the kind proprietor.  That\\'s where thelodger took this girl, and that\\'s where she learned to drink.\"\"Too much?\"\"Chuck it, dearie, chuck it.  Among all the wasters I\\'ve known, I\\'venever found one drunkard: they all called themselves moderatedrinkers.  Well, this girlie played double for a bit, and then met anice young man that wanted to marry her next day.  She woke up here.\"\"Did they drug her?\"\"Did they drug you?  They don\\'t have to drug you: you know that.  Theminute a girl tells me she was drugged, I say to myself: \\'You\\'re thekind that walk in and won\\'t take \"No\" for an answer.\\'  No, you catchflies with syrup; you don\\'t shoot them with machine-guns.  Narstybusiness, no?\"Violet was hearing for the first time how life made the net in whichit had taken her.  She passed her hand across her burning eyes.\"You seem to have seen a lot,\" she said.\"Haven\\'t I just?  I had my own little flat--to myself, too--once upona time, and I kept my eyes about me.  There was the Dago woman thatowned a fruit-stand on my corner.  She lived in an alley off HoustonStreet, and had a sixteen-year-old daughter who worked twelve hours aday rolling cigarettes.--Chuck me another, there\\'s a good girlie.Thanks, awfully.--That girl hated her work--can you blame her?--met aman that told her she wouldn\\'t have to work any more, and good-by.\"\"She went with him?\"\"Parsed out of sight completely, my dear.  Mother nearly crazy.  Wentto the police.  Police added the girlie\\'s name to their three columnsof other missing girls for that year, and said they couldn\\'t guesswhere she was.  An uncle tried to go on an inspection-tour of hisown, and had spent about all the family cash when he got to a flat onWest Fortieth Street and had its girls in for the usual drinks.  Hesaw his niece, but the bouncer knocked him down, and when he woke upin the arey, the happy family had moved.\"\"And that was all?\"\"That was all till, some two years later, the girl sent for hermother to come to Bellevue to see her die.  As soon as she was usedup, they\\'d turned her out without one of the pennies she had earnedfor them.--Narsty, eh?\"There was a brief pause.\"I guess,\" said Violet, \"there ain\\'t much chance for you unlessyou\\'re good.\"\"My dear,\" answered the Englishwoman, \"if you\\'re good, you haven\\'t achance at all.  It\\'s just a question of whether you have or haven\\'tenough to live on.  The best guardian of a man\\'s virtue is the worstenemy of a woman\\'s--and that\\'s an empty pocketbook, my dear.\"But Violet was in no mind for generalizations.\"It\\'s a business, then, ain\\'t it?\" she asked.\"A regular business,\" nodded Evelyn,--\"fifty cents up--and now thatthey\\'ve smashed the lotteries, policy, and the races, it\\'s more of abusiness than ever.  There are hundreds of young chaps all over thecountry who make their living by selling girls to places likethis--and worse than this; and there are more who make better livingsby making one, or two, or even three girls walk the street for them.Just now, in New York, the street\\'s the main thing.\"\"An\\' people like Miss Rose----?\"\"They buy the girls and pay a percentage on their work, my dear, tillthe debt\\'s cleared.  Sometimes they give their girls nothing butbrass checks for every job, but whether we get brass checks or realcash, it\\'s all the same: board and lodging and clothes are so highthat we never get out of debt to the madam.  Trust her for that!\"She had a thorough knowledge of her subject, and she ran on as if heronly interest in it were economic.  She talked of Denver, with itstwo-room houses in which the front seemed one large window where thesole inmate displayed her wares; of Chicago with the curtained doorsthrough which was thrust only a hand to receive the varying price ofadmission, even a quarter of a dollar occasionally sufficing; of thesame city\\'s infamous club maintained by politicians for their owndebauches.  She told of the proprietresses making a specialty of\"sending out\" for girls that worked at other and ill-paid tasks byday; of women conducting flats on a partnership basis; of those whorented, for high prices, houses that would otherwise be tenantlessbecause of poor conditions or the opening of some street that mustsoon be cut through the premises.  She said that young girls unsoiledwould sometimes fetch their owners fifty dollars for their initialdestruction, but that, as a rule, the sums were relatively small.\"And Miss Rose has to pay the police,\" asked Violet; \"don\\'t she?\"\"She does just, little innocent.  And the police have to pay theofficers above them, and the officers above them have to pay theward-bosses above _them_--and there you are.  It\\'s all the worsesince the bosses can\\'t make any money from gambling-houses, and it\\'sall the worse since the business got organized and meant votes forthe gang at every election.--Oh,\" Evelyn broke off--\"I tell you it\\'sthe same in every city the world over, my dear, and you and I haven\\'teven the comfort of being exceptions.\"\"Don\\'t people know about it?\"\"People don\\'t want to know about it.  People don\\'t want to feelbadly.  People say that it isn\\'t true, and that, if it is true, itisn\\'t fit to mention.\"\"Did you ever go to a dance-hall?\"Forgetting her recent attitude of democracy, Evelyn raised herpointed chin.\"I should say not,\" she answered.  \"Only a year ago I had thatapartment of my very own.  An Africander took me out of the chorus atthe \\'Gaiety\\' over home,--and a good job, too--and, when he died and Icame here, one of the best doctors in this town took care of me.  Hesaid he was going to marry me,\" she ended with a short laugh, \"butwhen his old wife died, he forgot that, and forgot me, and married asociety girl young enough to be his grandchild.  Of course he diedhimself after a few months, but that didn\\'t help me, my dear: I hadto strike out, and now, from the best places I\\'ve come down as far asthis.\"Violet was still too young to feel keenly for another while herselfin suffering, a fact that must have presented itself to Evelyn,because she turned from her own story with an easy shrug.\"After all,\" she pursued, \"the thing\\'s at least better run now thatit has become a men\\'s business.  There are no jobs left at the topexcept the running of the houses: the men get the girls, the rents,and most of the profits.\"\"Fritzie said they got lots of immigrants.\"\"Well, rather.  Most of the Dago ditch-diggers go home every winter,and any one of them will bring a girl back with him as his wife ifyou\\'ll pay him a little over the price of the passage money.  That\\'sone way, but there are a jolly lot more, not to mention themake-believe employment agencies that catch the girls by regiments.The women are packed over here in the steerage like cattle, my dear,and ticketed like low-class freight.  All they own goes into a smallhandbag and once they get here, they\\'re herded ten in a room till theagency-runners call for them.  Around Houston Street you can seestreets full of those nifty little agencies: they ship the girls allover the States.\"\"I never thought such things could happen.\"\"Of course you didn\\'t.  Nobody does, my dear--and that\\'s one reasonthey do happen.  Not that the immigrants are unduly favored.  Allover the East Side you can see families of the Chosen People goinginto real mourning for cadet-caught girlies, just as if the poorthings were really dead.  The other races suffer quite as much, too,though the Yankees are less likely to get into the cheaper joints.\"\"That\\'s where they give them the brass checks?\" asked Violet.\"Yes.  The man buys the checks downstairs, on a commutation schedule,just the w\\'y we used to buy our drink checks in a beer garden.  Thegirls never see real money--except when they make a touch, and thenit\\'s not any use--because they cash in their checks to the madam, andshe counts them against what her young l\\'idies owe her.  Even atthat\"--Evelyn nearly sat upright in her animation--\"even at that,they do s\\'y the men try to jew you down as badly as they do here.I\\'ve always noticed that the honestest man that ever lived will tryto cheat a girl.  But you\\'ll learn it all in time, girlie.  I\\'m onlysorry that you\\'ll never see the better plices.\"Violet missed the innuendo, but she asked:\"Then there are better and worse?\"Evelyn laughed.\"Right-oh!\" she said.  \"The horrid truth is, my dear, that we andRose are hopelessly middle-class.  I wish you could see the better,and as for the worse, wait till you live in a plice where there aresliding panels in the wall, and men are robbed every night.\"If there had been any sympathy in the Englishwoman\\'s tone, Violetmight have appealed to her for whatever of real assistance she couldgive, but Evelyn\\'s scarcely interrupted monologue soon made it clearthat she had no help to offer.\"It\\'s all rotten,\" she continued,--\"all rotten because it has to be.Do you fancy that, if Rose wasn\\'t sure of us, she wouldn\\'t have herear at that keyhole now?  She can call in Angel half the time, andone cop or another\\'s never far around the corner.  Three weeks agoPhil Beekman, one of her best customers, tried to balance a lamp onhis nose and broke it, and Riley was there to arrest him fordisorderly conduct before the boy could get to his wallet.  He had topay twenty-five dollars--half went to Riley--for that fifteen-dollarlamp that Rose had insured for eighteen.  We\\'re all that w\\'y; we allhave to be spies on the rest.  I am, you soon will be, and thatlittle Wanda--well, of course, Rose makes too much fuss over her.\"\"What do you mean?\" asked Violet.But Evelyn only shook her towsled yellow head.\"I mean, my dear,\" she said, \"that there are some things, you know,that even I don\\'t fancy discussing.\"\"She was an immigrant, wasn\\'t she?\"\"Oh, yes,\" Evelyn acquiesced, with a yawn.  Already her restlessheart was tiring of the conversation and her insistent thirst wascrying for more alcohol.  \"Wanda came over here to be a housemaid.She landed in Philadelphia and went directly to an employment agency,like a good girlie.  They took her money for their commission ingetting her a job, and then they sold her right over here to asailors\\' joint.\"\"For housework?\"\"Housework?  My dear, you overact your part.  There\\'s no houseworkdone in those plices; but Wanda\\'s won her w\\'y up in the world.  Hereshe is at Rose\\'s, if you please, though by what sort of housework Ishan\\'t tell you.\"\"I wish----\"\"Not another word, my dear.  Talking is a dry game.  After all,drinking is the king of indoor sports.  Come on down and rig a bit offizz.\"But Violet did not join in this predatory expedition.  She forgot theplight of the new captive whose cries she had heard; she forgot eventhe details of Evelyn\\'s just-related case; she remembered only somuch of the general situation, now made clear to her, as bore uponher own position, and she came at last to a pitch of crafty couragethat was far more promising of success than any of the hystericaldeterminations that she had previously experienced.  Open revolt wasfutile; she would employ methods more circuitous, and would usewhatever weapons were at hand.It was, as Evelyn had said, a house of spies and eavesdroppers, and,at the next opportunity--which occurred that night--Violet soughtagain her secret place of vantage on the back stairs, and listenedagain to her jailer in conversation with the Italian.  Her time, asit chanced, was brief, but she heard enough to know that Wesley Dykerwas the subject of the conference, and that betrayal of some sort wasits intent.\"Nothin\\' much,\" Rose was saying, in apparent answer to some questionasked before the spy had taken up her breathless post in the darkenedstairway.  \"I\\'ll get more out of him later on.\"\"Yas,\" replied Angel, \"but how mooch?\"\"He said he thought he\\'d pull it off, all right, but wasn\\'t sure ofO\\'Malley.  Said he\\'d got a bunch of kind words from up top, but wasscared for fear O\\'Malley would knife him.  He\\'s a pretty wise guy forall he\\'s a swell, and he\\'s lookin\\' out for the double-cross from yourcrowd.\"\"He ast you to helpa keepa lookout?\"\"Sure he did.  Said if O\\'Malley\\'s man put up a bluff at runnin\\'independent, I was to tip him off when O\\'Malley began registeringvotes here.\"\"That isa good.  More?\"\"Some.  Said he wanted me to keep my ears wide for any news.  Wantedme to pump you.\"\"He deed?\"  The voice grew threatening.  \"Say, now, you tella me whyhe knaw you knawa me?\"\"I guess he has as good ears as most people.\"\"But how he knawa me an\\' you----\"\"He don\\'t know that, Angel.  Keep your hair on.  He don\\'t knownothin\\' about it.  If he did, do you think he\\'d stand for it, an\\'cough up all these here straight tips to me?\"\"Na-aw,\" the Italian drawlingly admitted, in slow mollification.\"Naw, maybe he woulda not.\"\"He certainly wouldn\\'t.  He don\\'t know nothin\\' about it.  What he\\'safraid of is that somebody might think _he_ stood in too good here.\"\"He say that?\"\"Yep.\"\"Alla right.  Now, you tella him when he comes again, O\\'Malleymeans----\"The voice dropped to so low a whisper that Violet could hear no more,and, before it was raised, the doorbell had sounded and she had heardCeleste, upstairs, calling her.  She tiptoed back to the upperhallway.\"Cassie say you\\' New York Central frien\\' ees askin\\' for you,\"volunteered the French girl as they met.\"All right,\" answered Violet.  \"I\\'ll be right down.  I was trying toswipe a bottle.  And say, Celeste, how does that Wesley Dyker come tohave such a pull with Miss Rose?\"\"Oh-h!  You don\\' know?  That Wes\\' Dyk\\' \\'e mabby be a magistrate nex\\'\\'lection.  \\'E\\'s one gran\\' man now for bail an\\' lawyer when troublecome.--\\'Es\\'s frien\\'s with so many politicians, too.

But doesn\\'t she keep standing in, on the quiet, with theother people who want the place, too?\"Celeste nodded a cheerful agreement.\"But of a certainty,\" she said.  \"Meess Rose, she know \\'er beezness.Whoever get that \\'lection, Meess Rose, she will \\'ave been \\'eesfrien\\'.\"Violet asked no more.  She had learned enough to put into her handsthe best weapon just then available.XIION STRIKEKatie Flanagan arrived at the Lennox department-store every morningat a quarter to eight o\\'clock.  She passed through the employés\\' darkentrance, a unit in a horde of other workers, and registered theinstant of her arrival on a time-machine that could in no wise besuborned to perjury.  She hung up her wraps in a subterraneancloak-room, and, hurrying to the counter to which she was assigned,first helped in \"laying out the stock,\" and then stood behind herwares, exhibiting, cajoling, selling, until an hour before noon.  Atthat time she was permitted to run away for exactly forty-fiveminutes for the glass of milk and two pieces of bread and jam thatcomposed her luncheon.  This repast disposed of, she returned to thecounter and remained behind it, standing like a war-worn watcher onthe ramparts of a beleaguered city, till the store closed at six,when there remained to her at least fifteen minutes more of workbefore her sales-book was balanced and the wares covered up for thenight.  There were times indeed when she did not leave the storeuntil seven o\\'clock, but those times were caused rather by customersthan by the management of the store, which could prevent new shoppersfrom entering the doors after six, but could hardly turn out thosealready inside.The automatic time-machine and a score of more annoying, and equallyautomatic, human beings, kept watch upon all that she did.  Theformer, in addition to the floor-walker in her section of the store,recorded her every going and coming, the latter reported everymovement not prescribed by the regulations of the establishment; andthe result upon Katie and her fellow-workers was much the resultobservable upon condemned assassins under the unwinking surveillanceof the Death Watch.If Katie was late, she was fined ten cents for each offense.  She wasreprimanded if her portion of the counter was disordered after amauling by careless customers.  She was fined for all mistakes shemade in the matter of prices and the additions on her sales-book; andshe was fined if, having asked the floor-walker for three or fiveminutes to leave the floor in order to tidy her hair and hands, inconstant need of attention through the rapidity of her work and thehandling of her dyed wares, she exceeded her time limit by so much asa few seconds.There were no seats behind the counters, and Katie, whatever herphysical condition, remained on her feet all day long unless shecould arrange for relief by a fellow-worker during that worker\\'sluncheon time.  There was no place for rest save a damp, ill-lighted\"Recreation Room\" in the basement, furnished with a piano that nobodyhad time to play, magazines that nobody had time to read, and wickerchairs in which nobody had time to sit.  All that one might do was toserve the whims and accept the scoldings of women customers who knewtoo ill, or too well, what they wanted to buy; keep a tight rein uponone\\'s indignation at strolling men who did not intend to buy anythingthat the shop advertised; be servilely smiling under the innuendoesof the high-collared floor-walkers, in order to escape their wrath;maintain a sharp outlook for the \"spotters,\" or paid spies of theestablishment; thwart, if possible, those pretending purchasers whowere scouts sent from other stores, and watch for shop-lifters on theone hand and the firm\\'s detectives on the other.\"It ain\\'t a cinch, by no means\"--thus ran the departing CoraCostigan\\'s advice to her successor--\"but it ain\\'t nothin\\' now to whatit will be in the holidays.  I\\'d rather be dead than work in thetoy-department in December--I wonder if the kids guess how we thatsells \\'em hates the sight of their playthings--and I\\'d rather be dead_an\\'_ damned than work in the accounting-department.  A girl friendof mine worked there last year,--only it was over to Malcare\\'sstore--an\\' didn\\'t get through her Christmas Eve work till two onChristmas morning, an\\' she lived over on Staten Island.  Sheoverslept on the twenty-sixth, an\\' they docked her a half-week\\'s pay.\"An\\' don\\'t never,\" concluded Cora, \"don\\'t never let \\'em transfer youto the exchange department.  The people that exchange things allbelong in the psychopathic ward at Bellevue--them that don\\'t belongin Sing Sing.  Half the goods they bring back have been used fordays, an\\' when the store ties a tag on a sent-on-approval operacloak, the women wriggle the tag inside, an\\' wear it to the theaterwith a scarf draped over the string.  Thank God, I\\'m goin\\' to bemarried!\"In these conditions Katie found many imperative duties, but nonequite so immediately imperative as the repression of Mr. Porter.  Shehad not made her first sale at the main women\\'s hosiery counter onthe first floor, to which she had been assigned on herarrival--pretty girls always being favored with first-floorpositions--when that tall, gray-whiskered gentleman, his duties inhis underground office not at this hour holding him, majesticallyapproached her.\"Good-morning, Miss Flanagan,\" he said, with a beneficent smile, ashe placed his white hand upon her quailing shoulder.Katie became very busy with the stock that was new to her.\"Good-morning, Mr. Porter,\" she answered.--\"Say, Miss Isaacs, howmuch do these lisle ones sell at?\"\"I thought,\" said Mr. Porter, fixing her with his apparentlyemotionless gaze, \"that I would just come over and see if you werewell taken care of.\"\"None better, Mr. Porter.\"  Katie smiled sweetly as she said it, andstill more sweetly as she significantly added: \"Them\\'s always takengood care of as are used to takin\\' good care of themselves.\"Mr. Porter blinked, but his expression, or lack of expression, didnot alter.\"No doubt,\" he responded, as he reluctantly made ready to go away;\"but I shall be glad to be of help at any time I can.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\"And I shall drop around now and then to see that all goes well.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\"Because I was always interested in Miss Costigan--very muchinterested, and she was very pleasant to me--and I am naturally verymuch interested in her successor, too.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\"And, by the way, Miss Flanagan,\" he added as his Parthian shaft, \"Itrust you won\\'t worry over that little loan, you know; there\\'s nohurry in the world about repayment.\"Katie met his vacant glance with the innocent eyes of a gratefulchild.\"That\\'s kind you are, Mr. Porter,\" she answered, \"and since you sayit, I shan\\'t worry, sir.\"But for all that, she did not by any means dismiss the man from herthoughts.  Her true schooling had been received from the textbook oflife, and she had readily observed in Porter\\'s demeanor the tokensthat announced the beginning of a chase.  To one class of huntersthere is no closed season, and Katie knew that this class consideredher and her kind fair game.There had been occasions when she had debated seriously, sometimeswith herself and sometimes with a companion, whether it was worthwhile to continue the flight, whether from three to six years ofcaptivity, of toil that must end in death, but that was at leastassured of food, were not to be preferred to the continuance of aprecarious dodging through the industrial forest with the possibilityof starvation lurking behind every bush.  But this question she hadalways, thus far, answered in the negative, at first because of herinherent disinclination to confess defeat in any struggle thatengaged her, and at last because of Hermann Hoffmann.To Katie\\'s cheerful cynicism that blind optimist was an object ofunfailing tenderness.  She knew how he had been left, when hisfather\\'s heart was broken after a long battle against an oppressivelandlord system, with a gentle mother whom he worshiped and who thusbecame entirely dependent upon him; how he had sold the few remainingfamily belongings, escaped the threat of a compulsory militaryservice that would have left Frau Hoffmann in destitution, and come,lured by the glittering promises of one of the immigration agents ofa steamship company, to the land where he had been told there existedequality of opportunity for all men.  And he had told Katie, in hisconvincingly simple English, how, a shred at a time, the fabric ofhis ideal had been torn away; how bitterly he had toiled only to keephis foothold; how the little mother had fallen beneath the stress,and yet how, to the last, he still retained his high hope, and stilldreamed of a genuine democracy in a country where the men that workedwould eventually become the owners of the wealth that their handscreated.She was thinking of this when, that night, she returned to hertenement and found waiting at her door her neighbor Carrie Berkowicz,the shirt-waist worker, who had told her of the chance of a positionat the Lennox shop.\"Hello,\" said Katie.  \"Lookin\\' for me?\"\"Yes.\"\"Come on in.\"Katie led the way and lit the lamp, which threw a kindly light overthe neat, bare room, with its stiff wooden chairs, itsoilcloth-covered table, and the lithograph of Our Lady of the Rosarytacked against the room door.  A gas-stove, a cot, a bureau, and ascreened-off sink completed the furnishings.\"I\\'m just gettin\\' a bite of supper,\" she said, before she asked thecause of Carrie\\'s visit.  \"You\\'d better have some.\"\"No, thank you,\" replied the caller, with her careful night-schoolinflection.  \"I had mine early.\"Katie looked at the speaker, whose round cheeks seemed drawn in a newdetermination, and whose jaw was swollen as if from a blow.\"How did you get through so early, Carrie?\" she inquired.The little Lithuanian\\'s eyes sparkled.\"We\\'ve done it,\" she said.\"Done what?\"\"Gone out.\"\"Struck?\"Carrie nodded.\"You know how it was,\" she explained; \"all the girls around here do.We\\'ve had to work all day long from early morning till late night,Sundays too, and five dollars for the seven days is counted prettygood wages.\"\"But somebody said the firms\\' books showed your pay was higher.\"\"Oh, the books did show it.  You see, they carry only a few of us ontheir salary list, and then each of the foremen hires helpers paidout of one girl\\'s wages.  You know as well as I do that most of uslive on oatmeal and crackers, and rent one bed in somebody else\\'stenement.\"Katie was acquainted with enough of the shirt-waist makers to beaware that this was true.\"That\\'s so,\" she granted; \"only I thought them things were all endedafter the last row.\"\"Well, they weren\\'t ended; they were only helped for a few months,and now it\\'s summer and most of us would have been laid off.  It\\'sthe worst time to strike--we know that--but things came to a pointwhere we had to make a fight, or there wouldn\\'t have been any of usleft to fight when a better time did come.\"\"You\\'re talkin\\' about the union?\"\"Yes, that\\'s the real point.  The bosses started a union of theirown.\"\"Among themselves?\"\"No--they\\'ve always had that.  I mean they got the new girls intowhat they called a beneficial association, with the bosses forofficers.  If you join that, you get all sorts of favors, but youcan\\'t join unless you leave the old union.\"\"Well?\"\"Well, then, as soon as they get the beneficial association fullenough, they discharge the union girls and, little by little,withdraw the privileges from the Association members, so that thingsgo back to where they were before.\"The girl spoke quietly, but Katie remembered many of the evils thatCarrie had not mentioned.  She recalled how each moment\\'s pause inwork meant a deduction from the worker\\'s pay; how the elaboratesystem of fines taxed the girl whose fingers left her task torearrange a straying lock of hair, and how the tears forced byoverstrained nerves or over-exerted muscles cost the offender almosta fixed price apiece; how the girls that did piecework received nomoney unless they brought the little check for every article made,the firm thereby saving, through the inevitable loss of some of thesechecks, a proportion of payment as well known to them and as certainas the mortality rates of life insurance.\"An\\' so you went out, Carrie?\" she said.\"Yes; they turned down our committee at three o\\'clock this afternoon,and at three-fifteen we had all left the shops.  Oh, it was great!But they\\'ve got a lot of hands left, and they\\'ll have some of theirorders filled in Newark.  I don\\'t know how it will end.\"\"The bosses wouldn\\'t budge?\"\"Not an inch.  The most they did was to get some of us aside, eachaway from the rest, and offer us seven dollars a week apiece if we\\'dfix things up so that our friends would go back to work without anymore trouble.\"Katie, who well knew what seven dollars a week must mean to thiscalm, hardworking Lithuanian girl, who had come to America alone andwas saving to send her parents money enough to follow, shot asidelong glance at the speaker; but Carrie\\'s tone had not changed;she seemed unaware that she was narrating anything unusual.\"An\\' you turned down the offer?\" asked Katie.\"Last strike,\" said Carrie, \"one of those union girls was sent out tosell copies of a special edition of _The Call_ for the benefit of thestrikers.  She hadn\\'t had anything to eat for three days.  One mangave her a five-dollar bill for a single paper.  Nobody saw him giveit; she didn\\'t have to account for it; and she was nearly starved;but she came back and turned in that whole five dollars to the fund.That was one of the girls I was representing this afternoon.  Do yousuppose I could go back on such girls?  Do you suppose I could helpmyself when I knew it was hurting the others?\"Katie did not immediately reply, but her blue eyes shone.  Presentlyshe asked:\"Picket-duty, now, for yours?\"\"I began it right away.  I spoke to one scab as she came out--justasked her wouldn\\'t she join the union for her own good and ours--justlaid my hand on her wrist--but they had the cops ready and their ownstrong-arm men, and had three of them beating me for my pains.\"\"Pinched?\"\"Of course.  The magistrate let me off with a lecture on the rightsof every girl to work for starvation-wages if she felt like doing itand like making others starve.--But next time it will be a fine orthe workhouse.\"Katie had begun to busy herself with the preparations for her meal.She had warmed some coffee on the gas-stove and taken from thecupboard a roll and a few slices of dried beef.\"Look here,\" she said, stopping in the midst of this task; \"how muchmoney have you got?\"\"Oh, I\\'m all right, thanks.\"\"Maybe you are, but you might as well be better.  Now, the while thestrike lasts, just you give up that room acrost the hall an\\' comeover here with me.\"Carrie\\'s brown locks shook in doubtful refusal.\"You\\'re the real goods,\" she said; \"but I don\\'t have to do that.\"\"Of course you don\\'t have to, but I\\'d take it a real kindness.What\\'s the use o\\' keepin\\' a whole room to yourself when you\\'ll bespendin\\' parts of the time in jail?\"Carrie laughed.\"Will you let me pay half?\" she asked.\"Sure I will.\"\"Then perhaps----\"\"That\\'s settled,\" ended Katie, and it was arranged that Carrie\\'s fewsticks of furniture should be moved into the Irish girl\\'s quartersthe next morning.The details had just been settled when Hermann entered, his cheerfullips concluding the last bar of \"Die Wacht Am Rhein.\"\"Hello!\" said Katie, smiling.  \"Are you out of a job, too?  Or areyou just goin\\' to be late the night?\"Hermann pulled his cap from his blonde curls and, with blushingcheeks, grinned broadly.\"Needer,\" he answered.  \"I\\'m chust on my vay to de saloon.\"  Hetwisted his cap between his awkward fingers.  \"I vanted only to askyou somesing, Katie.\"\"All right.  Sit down an\\' ask it.  You know Carrie.  Don\\'t mind her.\"\"Sure I know her, only----\"Carrie rose.  She was aware of the pair\\'s relations, and too firmlybound by East Side etiquette to think it well to make of herself thatthird person who constitutes a crowd.\"I\\'ve got to be going,\" she said.\"Don\\'t you pay no attention to him,\" Katie objected.  \"Sit still.Have some coffee, Hermann-boy?\"But Hermann shook his head.\"No, thank you,\" he said.  \"I\\'ve got chust a minute.\"\"Then what was it you were wishin\\' to say?\"\"Aboud dot girl I dalked to you aboud on our vay to Coney.  You seenow you have a tshob, it seemed like ve might do somesing for her.\"Katie dropped all trace of banter.\"I\\'ll tell you how it is, Hermann,\" she said, and she did tell him.As soon as she had secured her place, she had determined to help.  Atpresent much financial assistance was impossible, and employmentthere was none.  It would be dangerous, moreover, to allconcerned--not least of all to Violet--for the girl to make a dashfor liberty in any manner that would give to Rose a chance to securevengeance through her friends the police.  But Katie was decided, andCarrie at once agreed, that, could the escape be arranged, Violetmight at least be sheltered in Katie\\'s room until some work should befound for her.\"All I want to know, Hermann-boy,\" concluded Katie, \"is however inthe world we\\'re goin\\' to get word to her.\"\"Dot\\'s chust vat I vanted fer to tell you aboud,\" said Hermann.  \"Youknow Conrad Schultz.  He\\'s now got my route vith de brewery-vagon.De stable\\'s chust two doors round de corner.  I\\'ve explained to him,und he\\'ll slip a note to Miss Violet the first dime he sees her.\"\"We\\'ll write to-night,\" said Carrie.\"An\\' I\\'ll hand it to him on my way to work in th\\' mornin\\',\" addedKatie.  \"Now you run along or you\\'ll be docked.\"Hermann assented, smiling.  He turned to the door, fumbled with theknob, and dropped his cap.  Katie, a steaming cup of coffee in onehand, stooped to recover it just as Hermann himself bent forward.  Inthe presence of a third person, the German felt a sudden thrill ofcourage.\"Ach, but you\\'re a goot girl, Katie!\" he cried.  \"Und here\\'s a liddlerevard fer it!\"He seized his cap, jerked her black head toward him, and imprinted aresounding kiss on her pink cheek.Katie laughed and broke free.  She spilled some of the coffee, butshe administered a smart blow with her open palm on the offendingmouth.\"You\\'d never dared to do it if you hadn\\'t thought I had me handsfull!\" she called after her lover as he clattered heavily and happilydown the stairs.  \"An\\' just in revenge for that,\" she added, stillblushing, to Carrie, as she closed the door, \"me an\\' you\\'ll go outfor a little spree of our own to-night.\"\"Where to?\" asked the factory-girl.\"To a dance,\" answered Katie.  \"Me feet have got that lazy walkin\\'after a job that I\\'m afraid they\\'ll forget all the dancin\\'-steps theyever knew, unless I hurry an\\' get some practicin\\' again.\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Carrie, doubtfully, \"I\\'ve got to get up early inthe morning.\"\"An\\' what about me?  Besides, haven\\'t I got me friend, thealarm-clock?\"\"But my jaw\\'s smashed from that fight.\"\"Who\\'ll see it?\"\"Let\\'s make it a moving-picture show.\"\"An\\' pay the same for half an hour\\'s headache that we could get awhole night\\'s dancin\\' for?\"\"I\\'ve got to be walking the picket-line all day to-morrow.\"\"Yes, an\\' I have to be standin\\' behind a counter.  You haven\\'t gotnothin\\' on me there.  Get your wraps together now an\\' come ahead,Carrie.  I hear there\\'s a new place opened on Grand Street.\"Carrie knew how to dance--the poorest girl on the East Side knowsthat, because not to dance is to miss the one amusement obtainable bythe very poor--and, like Katie, she was of that relatively small armythat can frequent the dance-halls for perhaps as much as a yearwithout contamination.  Before she had taken her course at thenight-school, she had even danced in the rooms that the Hebrewpoliticians provide behind their saloons near Houston Street, whereshe had seen cadets successfully ply their trade among bland-facedimmigrant girls whose very language was unknown to them; and she wastherefore wholly prepared for the picture that she confronted when,Katie having paid her ten cents for the two admissions, they enteredthe low-ceilinged basement of a saloon and tenement-house, and cameupon the meeting-place of the Danny Delancy Social Club.Through a veil of dust raised by stamping feet and swirling skirts,through a cloud of heat from a room with every window closed, througha blast of odors compounded of the fumes of alcohol, the scent oftobacco, and the miasma of sweating men and women, there rose, fromsomewhere, the cries of a beaten piano, struck and thumped into ashrieking likeness to the \"Chocolate Soldier\" waltz, which only nowand then was made at all audible above the rhythmic hubbub.  Althoughthe evenings of Saturdays and Sundays were the most popular fordancing, the floor was so crowded that only the expertness of thesetrained dancers prevented collision and panic.  The steam from thebodies of the performers joined with the dry dust in half obscuringthe blue-burning gas.  The strident laughter of the patrons helpedthe scraping of their feet in subduing the sounds of the piano.  Themen gyrated grimly in wet shirt-sleeves, and the women, affecting themost somber shades chosen for the longest wear, spun in theirpartners\\' arms with stolid, gum-grinding jaws and lips that weremirthless.  Except for the youthful \"spielers\" admitted withoutcharge, or even hired, to dance with the awkward or make wall-flowerssufficiently happy to insure their return, there were but two typesof men among the patrons.  There was the native of the quarter,heavy-faced, large-muscled, quick to anger and ready with the fists,a hard-drinking, hard-living sort, no more careful of his neighbor\\'smorals than of his own, yet good-natured, easy-going, pliable.  Andwinding in and out among these, slow and suave, like some sleekspecies of vulture, were the young men that came there not forpleasure, but for profit, always-smiling young men with mannersoffensively elaborate, whose shining black hair smelled of oil, whoseskin was like decaying dough, and whose entire time was spent inmaking the acquaintance of new girls, giving dancing-lessons to newgirls in crowded corners, and taking new girls into the adjoiningback-bar for a drink.To these types the attending women more or less corresponded.  Mostof them came alone, or in groups of two or three--a plain girl alwaysbefriended by one of more charm--because etiquette demanded that, ifa man brought a companion, his companion must give him what dances hewanted, and so she would have few offers from his fellows, whoobserved a rigid code that forbade poaching upon a friend\\'s preserve.There were some that could afford to wear gay dresses because theywere frankly in a business that, of however brief duration, made gaydresses possible as a luxury and necessary as an advertisement, andthis appearance of wealth was never absent from the hungry eyes ofthe young women about them.  There were others, also few, who wereplainly new either to the country or to this particular form ofamusement.  But the majority came from the factories and shops, luredby nothing worse than youth\\'s natural craving for its right topleasure, seeking to forget the exertions of the day in these newexertions of the night, drifting whither they neither knew norgreatly cared, the necessary factors of an industrial system toofatuous to conserve their efficiency.On every chair along the reeking walls, now trodden underfoot on thefloor, and now picked up like dry leaves and twirled about in thelittle eddies of warm air created by the romping dancers, were cardsand handbills--\"throwaways\" the patrons called them--which, often incurious English, announced special balls and \"grand receptions\"shortly to be given in this or some similar club.  Here one was\"cordially invited\" to the \"third annual dance given by the twowell-known friends, Greaser Einstein and Kid Boslair, at NewStarlight Hall, Gents Twenty-five and Ladies Fifteen\"; there one wascautioned not to miss the \"Devil Dance\" that would form a part of theforthcoming \"reception of the Harry Cronin Association, Young Theo,floor-manager\"; and again, one was told that the \"Special Extra Eventof the Season\" would be the ball of the \"Ryan McCall Social,Incorporated, Tammany Hall, ticket admit gent including wardrobe,Thirty-five cents; ladies free.\"Katie and the shirtwaist-maker got seats near the door, waved andcalled to half a dozen acquaintances and strained their eyes to seethrough the swirling mist.\"It looks like old times,\" said Carrie.\"Smells like \\'em,\" Katie amended; \"only I\\'ve been away from theseplaces for awhile an\\' I notice that, new place or old, the faceschange pretty quick.  Who\\'s the woman in red, with the yellow hair,Carrie?\"She pointed to a figure spinning about the center of the room, hercrimson skirt flying far behind her like the trail of a comet.\"I know her,\" said Carrie.  \"A year ago she came to New York from thecountry to find work.  When she was about starved, she rang a bellunder the sign \\'Helping Hand Home\\'--she didn\\'t know what that meantexcept that it meant charity.  The superintendent told her his placecouldn\\'t do anything for her; she might be spoiled by associatingwith the people he helped; his mission was for bad women that weresorry; not for good women that hadn\\'t anything to be sorry about.\\'But I\\'m hungry,\\' she told him.  \\'Can\\'t help it,\\' he said; \\'you\\'renot qualified.\\'  This girl went away, and came back a month later.\\'I don\\'t want to come in just yet,\\' she said; \\'but I do want to tellyou that I\\'m qualified now\\'--and she was.\"Katie took the facts for what, amid surroundings where such facts areplentiful, they seemed worth.\"Hard luck,\" she said, though not without meaning.\"Yes, and look at her clothes.\"\"That\\'s the trouble,\" said Katie; \"we can\\'t help lookin\\' at them--thelikes of us--any more than she can help wearin\\' them.  It\\'s that or atenement with two dark rooms an\\' the rent raised every year.\"They danced, for among the soberer men there were many that knewthem, and neither girl remembered the weariness of her work in theexhaustion of her dancing.  Between dances, in the dressing-room,they talked with their acquaintances among the girls, gossiping ofthe men and the other women, and now and then, their throats dry andtheir faces streaming, they were taken into the dingy side-bar andwere bought a glass of beer.As midnight drew closer the dance became more stormy.  Many of theworking-girls went home, and their places were filled by women of thebrighter dressed class.  There were some that were plainly drunk, andthese clumsily imitated the suggestive contortions of the salarieddancers now sent upon the floor to stimulate the amateurs.  One girl,in a cleared space surrounded by laughing men and envious, thoughapparently scornful, women, performed a dance popularly supposed tobe forbidden by the police.  There were several fights, and in oneespecially nasty scuffle a lad was badly cut by the knife of ajealous partner.\"I guess that\\'s about plenty for us,\" observed Katie, as she andCarrie shouldered their way from the crowd surrounding the woundedboy and his shrieking assailant.Both girls were sufficiently familiar with such episodes to acceptthem with calm, but both were at last tired out.\"I suppose you\\'re right,\" Carrie assented, \"though I did have a goodtime.\"\"An\\' it was you didn\\'t want to come!\" grinned Katie as they went outupon the cool street.\"I know.\"  Carrie\\'s round face grew hard and puzzled.  \"I know,\" sheadmitted, \"only sometimes----\"\"Och, come on, an\\' cheer up!  We must write our letter for thebrewery-man before we get to bed, Carrie-girl.\"They did write it, but Carrie, when she had gone into her own roomfor the last night she was to spend there, sat for some timemotionless upon the edge of the cot.\"I know,\" she repeated as if to some invisible confessor; \"I knowboth sides of it, and, honestly, I don\\'t know which is worse.  I knowall that can be said, only--sometimes--I wonder----\"XIIIJAIL-DELIVERYRose was ill--she had been drinking too much for the past week--andViolet, in her no longer fresh red kimona, was in the kitchen talkingto Cassie when, one morning, the new driver of the brewery-wagonstopped at the door.\"Morning,\" he said with what at once struck Violet, who was nowconstantly on the watch, as a visible effort at nonchalance.Conrad Schultz was a tall, raw-boned German-American, with a longnose and pale, sorrowful mustache, but with an eye in the ceruleandepths of which there lurked the cold fire of reliable strategy.\"Come in,\" said Violet, \"an\\' have a drop of something.\"\"Thanks.\"He came in cumbersomely, and took an uneasy seat.\"Some chilly for this season,\" he remarked, with a cool glance in thedirection of the ebony Cassie, hovering glumly in the background.Violet thought she caught the meaning of the man, whom she knew wasHermann Hoffmann\\'s successor.\"It is chilly for this time of year,\" she said.  \"What will you have?It better be something warming.  There\\'s whiskey here, or, if youdon\\'t mind waiting till Cassie goes for it, there\\'s some good brandyin the cellar.\"Schultz appeared to hesitate, and Violet, watching him, could not,for a moment, decide whether there was, after all, any foundation forthe hope that his appearance had wakened.\"Well, if it ain\\'t no trouble,\" he at last blurted, \"I would like ataste of real brandy.\"\"Cassie,\" said Violet, \"bring up a fresh bottle of brandy forMr.--Mr.----\"\"Schultz,\" prompted that individual.\"For Mr. Schultz, Cassie.\"Cassie, however, seemed to have scented surrounding mystery.\"Ah reckon there\\'s a bottle som\\'ares about yhere, Miss Vi\\'let,\" shedemurred.\"No, there isn\\'t.\"\"But, Miss Vi\\'let, there was one jes\\' half empty las\\' night.\"\"Miss Rose took that to bed with her.  Don\\'t talk so much.  Go downan\\' get a fresh bottle for Mr. Schultz.\"The girl left the room slowly and sullenly.Schultz sat silent and motionless until a moment had followed theclosing of the door.  Then the cold flame was relighted in his eye.\"She called you Miss Violet?\" he asked, though still in the mostcommonplace of tones.\"That\\'s my name.\"\"Did you ever talk to the man that had my job before I had it?\"Violet, with the catlike quiet and ease that always characterized hermovements, stepped to the door through which Cassie had just passed.She flung it quickly open.  The black girl nearly fell headlong intothe room.Without an instant\\'s hesitation, Violet did the one effective thing.She smacked the negress smartly across the face.\"I heard you!\" she said, in tones that were all the moreawe-inspiring because they were low.  \"What do you mean by spying onme, you black devil?  Think I want to cheat the house?  I\\'d not be soclumsy about it, if I did!  Think I\\'m trying to skidoo?  I\\'d walk outif I felt like it!  I\\'ll go right to Miss Rose about this, an\\' haveyou fired so quick you won\\'t have time to pack your duds!\"The servant remained as she had sprawled.\"Oh, please don\\', miss!\" she wailed.  \"Please don\\' tell Miss Rose!Ah wasn\\'t tryin\\' to spy on youse.  Ah jes\\' drapped somethin\\' yhere,an\\' ah was jes\\' tryin\\' to fin\\'----\"\"Don\\'t you lie to me,\" said Violet, her cheeks, now always so wan inthe morning light, flushing to something like their former color.\"Get up off your knees.\"\"Miss Vi\\'let, please don\\' tell on me.\"The black girl\\'s voice threatened to rise to a dangerous wail.\"All right,\" said Violet, quickly.  \"I\\'ll let it go this time; butyou hurry up and get that brandy, or I might change my mind.  Pullthe cork while you\\'re at it, and fetch a decent glass from thedining-room.\"Cassie, murmuring thanks with her thick lips, and wiping her eyeswith the big knuckles of her right fist, scrambled to her feet, andstarted again upon her errand.This time Violet left the door open.  She waited till the servant wasout of earshot.  Then she opened the door to the back stairway, whichshe herself had twice used to excellent purpose, and, finding nobodythere, returned to Schultz.\"Got something for me?\" she whispered.But no haste upon her part would speed his Teutonic caution.\"I asked you,\" he said, as if he had not observed the littleencounter through which he had sat serene and unconcerned, \"whetheryou knew the man who had my job before what I had it.\"\"Yes--yes, I knew him.  Quick!\"\"And your name is Miss Violet?\"\"You heard the girl call me that.  Can\\'t you hustle?\"\"I don\\'t want to hustle.  If you\\'re the girl I want, you\\'ve kept mewaitin\\' here three mornings already.\"\"Well, I\\'m the person all right.  You know that now.  Oh, won\\'t youplease hurry?  Don\\'t you see how things are here?\"\"I seen enough to make me want to go slow.\"\"You\\'re going slow all right.  What more do you want to know?  Italked to the man you\\'re telling me about and he said he\\'d see whathe could do.\"Her replies came with the rapidity of musketry, but Schultz spokewith stubborn deliberation.\"Was that all he told you?\"\"Sure it was.\"\"Nothin\\' more?\"\"No.--Can\\'t you hurry?  Can\\'t you believe me?--He didn\\'t say nomore.--Quick!--Oh, yes, he said he\\'d talk to his girl Katie aboutme.--Quick!--Hush-t!  Here she comes!\"Cassie\\'s step sounded only a few yards away, but Schultz, nowapparently satisfied of Violet\\'s identity, displayed an unlooked forspeed.  The heavy hand that had been clumsily reposing in the bulgingside-pocket of his coat shot free.  Violet seized a fist that openedand withdrew as her own fingers closed on a bit of paper.Cassie entered to find them the width of the kitchen apart.  Violetwas pouring herself a drink of whiskey into a soiled glass, and, ifher hand trembled, the silk swathed back that was presented to theservant hid all tokens of nervousness.She waited until Schultz had slowly drunk his brandy.  She waited toexchange a few more words and to see him go.  She even waited alittle longer in order not to make her retreat too patently hurriedand in order to subdue by threats and cajolery whatever suspicionsmight still be lingering in the black breast of the apparentlypenitent Cassie.  But at last she made her way to her own room andunrolled the bit of paper.It was a letter dated from Katie\\'s address four days previous to theday of its receipt, and it was couched in stiff and formalphraseology.  She read:\"Miss VIOLET,\"_Dear Miss Violet--_\"This is to inform you that I am Miss Katie Flanagan, particularfriend of Mr. Hermann Hoffmann, who used to drive the brewery-wagonthat left beer at your house.  He told me about you and what youwant, and I told a lady friend, Miss Carrie Berkowicz, who is comingto live with me.  I have just got into a small job and Carrie hasjust got out of one, and we don\\'t know of none yet for you, but we\\'llkeep looking and sure will find one, and meantime we want you to comehere and stop with us just as soon as you can beat it from that placewhere you are.  Don\\'t you lose your nerve, and don\\'t bother to talkabout things when you get here, because we know how it is.  Youneedn\\'t worry about how we feel, we have too many friends who had thesame bad luck as you, and least said soonest mended, we think.  Socome right here first chance you get and stay as long as you like,and if we\\'re not home when you get here sit on the step till we doget home, and if anybody asks any questions just say you\\'re a friendof ours, because you are, and that\\'s none of their business anyhow,and nobody won\\'t bother you any more.\"Now keep your head cool and God bless you with best wishes!  \"From your friend          \"MISS KATIE FLANAGAN.\"Without daring to lessen her courage by giving way to the feelingsthat this letter stirred, Violet read it twice, tore off the address,concealed it in one of the \"rats\" on which the structure of herrusset hair was founded, and then tore the rest of the epistle intosmall bits, which she flung out of the narrow space between theriveted shutters of her room.  She was now almost ready to strike.In her captivity, she had, after the first shock, made it herbusiness to learn what she could of those about her.  She knew thatWesley Dyker had once been what was called a straw-bail man, an agentwho, for a high consideration, provided bogus bail for such women asthe police, to keep up appearances, were forced from time to time toarrest.  She had been told that he was wont, for a still higherconsideration, to appear at court for these clients, in the rôle of adefender of the wronged poor, and in a very different rôle in theirbehalf with the dispensers of justice to the underworld.  She hadgathered that his friendship with one political faction aided insecuring Rose the chance to purchase that expensive police-protectiontoward which Angel, unknown to Dyker, assisted Rose through anopposing faction.  And she believed that his ambition was now to gaina magistracy from which he could grant bail on bonds signed by hisown servants, secure for prisoners the legal service of men thatwould return him a commission, and pronounce judgment or dispensemercy for the furtherance of his own fortune and the strengthening ofhis own power.  Out of these threads of knowledge Violet resolved toweave the net in which to catch freedom.That afternoon Evelyn informed her that Rose was still abed and hadsent for her favorite, Wanda, to console her.  This meant that shewould not descend to the ground floor or be visible to any visitorsbefore the next evening, and that the Englishwoman, promoted totemporary command, would have to pass the night in that reception ofcallers which necessitated the appearance of drinking much and thefact of drinking almost nothing.\"She does that every time she goes on a bust, my dear,\" complainedEvelyn.  \"Of course she jolly well knows that she can trust me andthat I have some manners too, but I wish she would remember that Ialso have a thirst and can\\'t do without my drop of real liquor.\"Violet\\'s nerves tingled.  With her best effort to bury all signs ofher mounting hope, she ventured:\"I wish I could help you.\"\"You, my dear?\"  Evelyn\\'s eyebrows raised and her contralto voicefollowed them.  \"Catch the madam letting anyone but me take charge!You know you\\'re none of you allowed down in the front hall unlessyou\\'re sent for.  Things are ticklish enough, thank you, with thatnew girl upstairs.\"It was almost the first mention that had been made to Violet of thelatest captive since the recent day of Evelyn\\'s exposition of theentire traffic.  Violet had not dared to ask any more questions thanthose that she deemed necessary for the perfection of her own plans,and she dared ask none now.\"I do hate the job,\" Evelyn was continuing, \"even if it does mean afew bits extra.  Rose says that fellow Dyker is due to-night.  She\\'snot fit to see him above all men, and he\\'s the one I mostparticularly hate to meet, because he was a friend of my friend thedoctor and used to call with him now and again at my flat.  I alwaysfancy he\\'s making comparisons under those narsty low lids of his.\"Violet, in sudden reaction, felt choking with despair.\"I could see him,\" she said.But Evelyn\\'s honors sat heavily upon their possessor.\"You\\'re not a trusty yet, my dear, by any manner of means,\" sheresponded.  \"No, no; you will go to your own room after dinner andstay there till you are wanted.\"She tilted her sharp chin and strolled kitchenward for a drink; but,though she left behind Her a Violet discouraged, it was not a Violetbeaten.In fact, the girl made her own opportunity.  Noticing that eveningthat Evelyn took up a dignified position in the parlor and had Cassieconduct all the guests thither, Violet quickly disposed of the firstperson that claimed her attention, and, having made her besttoilet--having restored her cheeks to a resemblance of their pristineglow, coiffed her russet hair, and donned her best of linen--shedescended quietly to the first landing on the stairway, there to takeup her watch.  Before she was again in demand, she saw the servantadmit Wesley Dyker.  She ran quickly downward and, just as Cassiestepped forward to precede him, brushed by him in the rosy twilightof the hall.\"Ask to see me,\" she whispered.  \"Ask to see Violet.  Don\\'t let on Itold you.  I\\'ve heard something you want to know about O\\'Malley.\"Before the man\\'s shadowy figure could come to pause, she had passedhim and caught up to Cassie.\"Where have you been?\" she asked.  \"I\\'ve been calling for you forfive minutes.  I need some more water in my room.\"She turned and reascended the stairs, but her door had not long beenclosed before the servant was knocking upon the panel.\"Here\\'s you\\' water, Miss Vi\\'let,\" said Cassie.  \"An\\' Miste\\' Dykerwants fer to see you daown in de back parlor.\"Violet took the useless pitcher, made sure that the remnant ofKatie\\'s note was secure in its hiding-place, and hurried, with Cassiefollowing, to the garish room in which Dyker was awaiting her.He was seated on the lazy, pillowed sofa on which Violet had fallenasleep so soon after her arrival in this house.  He was inevening-clothes that served him, on the East Side, much as theadvertised portraits of certain patent-medicine makers serve theirproprietors, the flaccid whiteness of his face still bearing tracesof past beauty, the weakness of his mouth hidden by his crisp, short,brown mustache, and his heavy lids concealing the secret of hissteel-gray eyes.He half rose as she entered, but she motioned him to sit still.\"Hello!\" she said, with the easy manner of the house, which alwaysseemed to presuppose a previous acquaintance.  \"Have you orderedanything?  I\\'m terribly dry.\"He took her hand and caught her meaning,\"So am I, Miss Violet,\" he answered.  \"Let\\'s have something.\"Violet turned to the servant.\"Cassie,\" she said, \"bring up a couple of bottles.\"She waited for the door to close, and then sat down beside Dyker.\"Speak low,\" she cautioned.  \"That girl will listen if she can.You\\'ll have to pretend to be making love to me.\"Dyker regarded her with smiling approval.  Her blue eyes shone withexcitement and red blood fought through the rouge on cheek and fullyripe mouth.\"What you ask will be both easy and pleasant,\" he answered.\"No, no; none of that.  This is no time for bluffing.  Put your armaround my shoulder.  That way.  Now then, you heard what I told youin the hall?\"Dyker, with his type\\'s disinclination to take seriously anything thatany woman has to say upon serious matters, smiled assent.\"You seem to have been doing some listening yourself,\" he said, ashis lingers tightened unnecessarily upon her shoulder.\"Yes, I did, and it\\'s lucky for you I did it.  Will you promise notto give me away?\"\"Of course I promise.\"\"Not even to Miss Rose?\"\"Not even to Rosie.\"\"And if I help you, will you do me a favor?\"\"To look at you I should say that I\\'d do you any favor you asked, anddo it without expecting anything in return.\"His pale lips were curled in a half-scoffing smile, but Violet\\'s nextwords brushed from his flaccid face all traces of amusement.\"You remember that night you told Miss Rose about what you wanted toget at the next election?  You said you were afraid of O\\'Malleygiving you the double cross.\"Dyker stiffened.\"Did you hear that?\" he demanded.\"Hush!  Keep your voice down, or I won\\'t tell you nothing of what Iknow.  Remember you\\'re supposed to be making love to me.\"\"All right, all right; but I want an answer to my question.\"\"Well, then, of course, I heard it.  I was at the keyholethere--that\\'s why I want you to whisper now.--And I heard more.\"\"What was that?\"\"Wait a minute.  You\\'ll do me a favor if I tell you?\"\"Anything,\" he smiled.\"But this is business.  If I tell you something that it\\'s worth yourwhile to know, will you promise not to blow on me to Miss Rose?\"\"I promise.\"\"And to do something more that I\\'ll ask you?\"Wesley was now certain that he must not stick at promises.\"Surely.\"\"Then sit tight.  I don\\'t know as much about O\\'Malley as I pretendedout there in the hall, but I do know about Miss Rose.  I don\\'t knowwhether O\\'Malley is goin\\' to double-cross you or not, but I do knowthat Miss Rose has given you the double-cross already.\"She had thought that passion played a large part in his relationswith her mistress, and she had counted upon awakening his jealousy.What, however, had far exceeded his affection was a poor pride ofpossession, and when Violet\\'s words, in addition to touching hisambition, struck at that pride, they aroused an anger that was farmore dangerous than any sense of love betrayed.\"What\\'s that?\" he demanded.Two red beacons flashed into his pale checks, and his heavy lids,shooting upward for a single instant, disclosed hard, gray eyes gonehot and malevolent.\"Be careful.  Speak low, I tell you,\" she cautioned; \"and rememberyour promise.\"\"I don\\'t believe----\"\"Here\\'s Cassie!\"They waited while the black opened the champagne and filled theglasses.Violet brushed Dyker\\'s hair over his eyes and laughed at the effect.Dyker caught the offending hand and kissed it by way of punishment.\"Cassie,\" he banteringly asked, \"why didn\\'t you ever tell me therewas such a nice little girl in this house?  I had to get the newsfrom a friend on the outside.\"He tossed the now grinning negress a dollar and, as soon as she hadleft them, dropped the farce as promptly as did Violet.\"I say I can\\'t believe you,\" he resumed, the two spots of anger stillglowering in his cheeks.Violet knew that her whole hope rested upon her ability to forceconviction.\"You\\'ve got to believe me,\" she said.  \"I\\'ll tell you all that youtold Miss Rose till I had to run away, that evening.\"She did it, omitting scarcely a particular.\"That\\'s right, ain\\'t it?\" she concluded.\"May be.  But what does that prove?  It only shows that you heard me.\"\"It shows that I can hear Miss Rose when she talks to somebody else.And I did hear her.\"\"Whom was she talking to?\"\"The man you asked her about.  To Rafael Angelelli.\"\"Well, but I told her to talk to him.\"\"An\\' she did it.  But the first time I heard her was just before youtold her to.\"\"That same night?\"\"He was in the kitchen with her when you came in.  Why, he\\'s here allthe time!  I don\\'t care what she pretends to you, she\\'s stuck on him,an\\' every girl in the house knows it.\"Rapidly, but as fully as she had sketched the dialogue between Roseand Dyker, she now described the first conversation that she hadoverheard between her mistress and the Italian.\"I\\'d come down to graft a drink,\" she said, \"an\\' I heard them fromthe stairs.  That\\'s how, after he\\'d left, I came to listen to youtoo.\"Dyker had quailed under the revelation, thus made to him, ofpolitical danger.  He now quivered in anger at the comments uponhimself, somewhat colored, that Violet had placed in the mouths ofRose and Angel.\"I\\'ll find out about this!\" he said, struggling against the desperatearms flung swiftly around him to keep him on the sofa.  \"Let me go!By God, I\\'ll have that drunken cat down here and squeeze the truthout of her throat!\"All the caution, all the craft, all that she had counted upon as thereal Wesley Dyker seemed to have escaped him.  His voice was stilllow, but in every other respect he was a raging beast.She fought with him, mentally and physically.\"You can\\'t get anything out of her that way,\" Violet urged, as theman twisted under her strong hands.  \"Of course she\\'ll say it\\'s alllies.  And you\\'d only be warning her.  You don\\'t want her to knowthat you know; you want a chance to block her game.\"Partly convinced by this argument and partly subdued by the physicalrestraint that accompanied it, Dyker ceased his struggles.\"But I want to be sure,\" he muttered sullenly.\"You can\\'t be sure by goin\\' to Miss Rose.\"\"Well, I ought to tell her.\"  The high tide of his anger was slowlysubsiding, and the rocky Dyker that she had built on was beginning toshow its crest above the still hissing waves.  \"Look here, Violet,\"he said, \"I\\'m sorry I behaved like such a fool.  I beg your pardon,but you must see that I have got to put this thing up to Rose.\"\"You forget your promise.\"\"No, I don\\'t, but I must make sure.\"Violet thought rapidly.\"Listen,\" she said; \"I told you I wanted you to do something for mean\\' you gave your word you\\'d do it.--Will you?\"\"Of course I will, only I\\'m thinking a little about myself.\"\"This will help you, too.\"\"What do you want?\"Violet drew a long breath.\"I want you to go over to the avenue right away,\" she said, \"and buyme a long cloak and a hat and bring them back, and then take me outof here without a word to anybody.  You needn\\'t walk more\\'n threesquares with me, an\\' then I won\\'t bother you no more.\"Dyker drew away and whistled softly.  His face grew quite composedagain.  The heavy lids fell over his eyes.\"So that\\'s it, is it?\" he asked.\"I want to get away,\" said Violet.\"And so you\\'ve cooked up this little mess of lies to make me thegoat, eh?\"Violet felt the sands slipping beneath her feet.  She laced herfingers together till the knuckles bruised her flesh.\"Don\\'t do that,\" she pleaded; \"don\\'t take it that way; it\\'s true,what I told you, every word of it.  I only want you to keep yourpromise to me.\"She stopped with a sob, and waited.Wesley reached calmly for a glass of wine, drank it, put down theglass, thrust his hands deep into his trousers\\' pockets, and,stretching out his long legs, regarded, humming, the toes of hisshining pumps.\"I don\\'t believe you,\" he said at last.\"But, Mr. Dyker----\"\"It\\'s too thin.\"\"Even if it was a lie,\" Violet despairingly persisted, \"you ought tohelp me.  Do you know who I am?\"\"That\\'s the point.\"\"Do you know how I was brought here?\"\"I can guess.\"\"I was tricked.  The man said he wanted to marry me.  I didn\\'t know.I believed him.  An\\' they beat me an\\' starved me and did things Icouldn\\'t think about an\\' couldn\\'t help thinkin\\' about.  An\\' all Iwant is just for you to do me this one little favor.  I won\\'t botheryou.  I won\\'t blow on you----\"\"What\\'s that?\"\"Oh, you know I wouldn\\'t blow on you!  I couldn\\'t.  I want to forgetthe whole thing.  I\\'ve got friends to go to who\\'ll get me work.  Ionly want you to get me out of the door and safe away.\"Like most men of his sort Dyker, although ready enough to make aliving out of the results of cruelty, hated the sight of cruelty\\'sself.  The girl\\'s words touched, though lightly, his selfish heart.\"But I can\\'t afford to help you,\" he protested.  \"You see how I\\'mtied up here.  I can\\'t have Rose jump on me now.\"\"You know she\\'s jumping on you already.  You know she\\'s knifing youin the back.  The only way you can stop her is by using what I\\'vetold you.\"\"Of course,\" said Dyker in the tone of a man thinking aloud, \"if shereally was playing both ends against the middle, I could pull herteeth by going straight to O\\'Malley and telling him so.\"Violet did not wholly understand this, but she agreed immediately.\"Of course you could,\" she said.\"And I suppose I could have her pinched then, if you\\'d testifyagainst her.  Would you do that?  Would you go into court?\"Violet\\'s fingers closed spasmodically.\"Just give me the chanc\\'t,\" she said fervently.\"And of course there are other girls who\\'ve been in the same scrapehere?\"\"There\\'s a new one upstairs this minute.\"\"There is?  Um.  That\\'s good.\"  He rattled the money in his pocket.\"Only, look here,\" he persisted, \"if you have been telling the truth,it will probably make me solid with O\\'Malley, but if you haven\\'t,I\\'ll go clean to smash.\"Violet saw the turn of affairs and, with hope\\'s revival, her mindcleared immediately.\"I haven\\'t told you all,\" she said, \"and I guess the rest will makeyou sure enough.\"\"There\\'s more then?\"\"A lot.\"\"What is it?\"\"Will you help me out of here?\"\"If you convince me.--Let\\'s see; the shops around here are stillopen.--Yes, if you convince me, you\\'ll be out of here in half anhour.\"It was her only chance.  She did not hesitate.  She told him thewhole of what she had heard of the later assuring interview betweenRose and Angelelli.This time he listened quietly, his face inscrutable.\"That all?\" he asked when she had ended.\"That\\'s all,\" she said.\"It\\'s the truth?\"\"Ain\\'t I sayin\\' it proof that it\\'s true?  How could I make it up?  Idon\\'t know all that it means.\"\"You knew enough to pass it on to me.\"\"Lucky for you I did, too; but I don\\'t know all it means--how couldI?--and you do know, an\\' that ought to be proof enough that it\\'sGod\\'s truth, Mr. Dyker.\"She stopped.  Her case was with the jury.Dyker rose.\"Cassie!\" he called.Violet leaped to her feet and laid her hands on his arm.\"What are you goin\\' to do?\" she whispered.He silenced her with a gesture.\"What you want,\" he said.Cassie put her black head in at the door.\"Cassie,\" he continued, flipping the maid another dollar, \"I\\'m alittle off my feed.  I\\'m going to the drugstore on the corner and getfixed up.\"\"Thank you, Miste\\' Dyker.--Ah kin go fer you, Miste\\' Dyker,\" said thenegress.  \"Thank you, sah.\"\"No, thanks, Cassie, I can go myself; I want the air.  But you can dosomething else for me.  You can just not let this girl run away fromme.  I know she would run if she could, but I like her too well tolet her, so if anybody wants her, just you say she\\'s in here andengaged for the evening by me.  I\\'ll be back in fifteen minutes.\"He left one door as the willingly assenting Cassie closed the other,and Violet flung herself on the sofa and buried her face in thecushions, now fearful that the servant, notwithstanding theirprecautions, had overheard her, now afraid that Dyker would changehis purpose and fail to return, and again dreading that he mightbetray her to Rose.  Since the night she had waited for Max totelephone in the café, since the terrible morning that had followed,it was the longest quarter of an hour that she had known, but it atlast dragged its quivering length away.  The doorbell rang.  Cassiepassed through the room to find Violet sitting suddenly upright, andat once returned with Dyker, his summer raincoat tossed across hisarm.As the servant left them, he lifted the coat.  Below it, not wrappedin the paper usual to a new purchase, was a dark cloak.  He unrolledit, uncovered a beaver hat, and handed them both to the pantingViolet.\"Here you are,\" he said quietly.She seized them and began to put them on.\"No,\" he cautioned, \"on second thought, I guess I\\'d better carrythem.  The parlor door\\'s open, and Evelyn and Fritzie are in therewith a couple of men.  I\\'ll go ahead and open the vestibule door andthe front door.  Then you come by as if you were going upstairs.\"\"Evelyn\\'ll come out to see if I have any money.\"\"She\\'ll never learn that, though here, by the way, is a ten-dollarbill that will come in handy.--The doors will be open and I\\'ll be onthe pavement.  Keep only a yard behind me.  Riley\\'s at the other endof his beat, and I have a cab at the curb.  Ready?\"She could not speak, but she nodded her russet head.He passed before her up the rosy twilight of the hall.Violet, following, her lips tight, her breathing suspended, her heartpounding against her breast, was dimly aware of her own softfootfalls sounding hideously loud, of the blast of light and laughterfrom the parlor.Dyker flung wide the vestibule door.\"Good-night!\" he called to Evelyn.\"Going?  Good-night!\" Violet heard the Englishwoman answer.She heard Evelyn rise.  She heard the front door open.  She sawWesley raise his arm.She hurried by the parlor door, and then, instead of turning to thestairs, gathered up her red kimona and ran through the vestibule,through a patch of soft, fresh darkness, and was tossed precipitatelyinto a cab into which Dyker followed her just as the horse, under aquick blow, dashed madly up the street.At the open cab-window the night air beat upon her fevered face.  Shedrank it deep into her thirsting lungs.  It was the wine of freedom.XIVRIVINGTON STREETThe eastern end of Rivington Street is a hectic thoroughfare.  Oftenit is so hectic as to be no thoroughfare at all, but only a tossingfever-dream, a whirling phantasmagoria of noisy shadows, grotesqueand reasonless.  It seems a street with a bad conscience, for itnever sleeps.The dawn, even in summertime, hesitates long before it comesshivering up from the crowded East River to drop a few grudged raysof anæmic light on Rivington Street.  Already, out of the hummingcourts, the black alleys, and the foul passages that feed this avenueas gutters feed a sewer, a long funeral procession of littlehandcarts has groped its way and taken a mournful stand beside thefetid curbs; and soon, pausing at these carts to buy the rank morselsof breakfast that there is never time to eat at home, the gray armyof the workers begins to scurry westward.First come the market-laborers, with shoulders bowed and musclescramped from the bearing of many burdens.  Upon their heels march thepale conscripts of the sweatshops, their hands shaking, their cheekssunken, their eyes hot from loss of sleep.  Follow the sad-lippedfactory-girls, women before their time, old women before their youth,and then the long line of predestined shop-clerks, most of them stillin short skirts and all of them, befittingly, in mourning-black.Swiftly they go, the whole corps of them, the whole corps strangelysilent.The street is not emptied of them before it is filled again, now bysolemn children on their way to school, children whose gaze is fixed,whose mouths are maturely set, and whose voices, when they are heardat all, are high, strident, nervous.  As these go by, the shops beginto do business: the cheap food-shops, the old-clothes shops, theshops that sell second-hand five-cent novels for a copper, and thepawnbrokers\\'.  The shawl-hooded housewives clutter in and out,selling first that they may buy afterward, and continuing like antsswarming about an ant-hill until noon strikes and the children paradestolidly away from school for luncheon, and back again.At that hour the underworld of Rivington Street enough recovers fromits drunkenness of the night preceding to stagger forth and drinkagain.  The doors of the shouldering saloons swing open and bang shutin a running accompaniment, and the highway rocks with it until acloud of clattering two-wheeled push-carts swoops from \"The Push-CartGarage\" around the corner and alights as if it were a plague ofpestilent flies.  Bearded Jews propel these, Jews with shiningderbies far back upon their heads, who work sometimes for themselves,but more often for the owners of the push-cart trust, who squabblefor positions in the gutter where an impotent law forbids any of themlong to remain, but where, once entrenched, they stand for hours,selling stockings at five cents and shirts at ten, mirrors andvegetables, suspenders and lithographs, shoestrings andpicture-postcards, collars of linen and celluloid, all sorts of cheapdress-material, every description of brush, fruit, and cigar-butts.The carts are end-to-end now; one could walk upon them fromcross-street to cross-street.  Each has its separate gasoline torchleaping up, in flame and smoke, to the descending darkness.  Uponthem charge the returning army of workers.  The crowd is all movingeastward; you could not make six yards of progress to the west; thesidewalks overflow, the street is filled.  The silence of the morninghas changed to a mad chorus of discords.  The thousand weary feetshuffle, the venders shriek their wares; there is every imaginablesound of strife and traffic, but there is no distinguishable note ofmirth.  Wagons jostle pedestrians, graze children, are blocked, heldup, turned away.  The thoroughfare is like a boiling cauldron; it canhold no more, and still it must hold more and more.Only very slowly, as the night wears on, do the crowd and noiselessen; but at last, by tardy degrees, they do lessen.Imperceptibly, but inevitably, even this portion of New York breathessomewhat easier.  By twos and threes the people melt away; a note ata time, the cries weaken and the shuffling dies; and finally, in thesmall hours of the morning, Rivington Street turns over, with atroubled sigh, to a restless doze.But to doze only.  Its bad conscience will grant it no absoluteoblivion, no perfect rest, however brief.  Cats yell from the dizzyedges of the lower roofs; dogs howl from the doorsteps.  Back in thenarrow courts and alleys and passages, drunken battles are won andlost.  The elevated cars roar out the minutes through the nocturnaldistances.  An ambulance clangs into a byway street.  A patrol-wagonclatters past.  Rivington Street turns and tosses on its hot couch,and through its dreams slink hideous shadows that dare not showthemselves by day.  One, ten, a hundred, each alone, they come andgo: vague, inhuman.  And then, reluctantly, the hesitant dawn creepsshivering out of the East River, and the weary day begins again.Into this street--into its noisiest quarter at its noisiest time--thecab that bore Violet on her way to liberty at last turned andproceeded as far under the flaring gasoline torches as the eveningcrowd of workers, buyers, and sellers, would permit.  The girl,through the dark thoroughfares that had preceded it, had answered ascore of questions, which Dyker had asked her, the fever of escapebeating high in her breast and tossing ready replies to her heatedlips; but now, in the roar and brilliance of Rivington Street\\'snocturnal traffic, there had come upon her a terror almost equal tothat which had assailed her when, with Max for her guide, the lightedlength of East Fourteenth Street had first unrolled itself beforeher.  The city was again an inimical monster awaiting her descentfrom the cab, and the newly acquired habit of seclusion, the habit ofthe prisoner, recoiled upon her.  Freedom was strange; it becameawesome, and when the horse was stopped and Violet knew that she mustsoon fare alone, she cowered in a corner, breathing hard.\"Can\\'t go no furder, boss,\" said the cabby, leaning far around fromhis seat.  \"Where to now?\"\"Nowhere right away,\" answered Dyker.  \"Just stand where you are fora minute.\"Then he turned to Violet.\"Now,\" he said, not unkindly, \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to drop you here.It wouldn\\'t do for me to figure publicly as an active agent in thiscase, you know.  But you needn\\'t worry.  Just get out and walk to thenext corner.  Turn to your right, take the next cross-street to yourleft, go up the first narrow street you come to, and your friend\\'shouse ought to be about the third in the row.  It will be a littledark, but you won\\'t have any trouble finding it.\"Violet hesitated.\"I hope I won\\'t,\" she said.\"Surely not.  If you have, just ask the way of the first policemanyou see.\"\"Not a policeman, Mr. Dyker!\"\"Of course, a policeman.  He won\\'t hurt you as long as you keep yourcloak tight.  Now, you\\'re sure you\\'ve given me the right address?\"\"I gave you the one the man gave me.\"\"Yes, but I mean you\\'re not lying to me?\"Violet\\'s wide eyes should have been sufficient denial.\"Why would I do that?\" she asked.\"That\\'s so; only I thought--well, I beg your pardon, Violet.  Youhave my office-address on that card.  I\\'ll send for you in a day ortwo--be sure to be home every afternoon--and then we\\'ll fix MadameRose with the District-Attorney.--Good-by.  Sure you\\'re not afraid?\"Her gratitude would not permit her to acknowledge fear.\"Not afraid,\" she smiled, rather grimly.\"Then remember: the first street to your right, the next to yourleft, and then to your right again--third or fourth house in the row.\"He opened the cab-door and alighted, holding out his hand.She straightened her beaver hat, drew the folds of her dark cloaktightly over the betraying crimson of her kimona, and, helped by hisgrasp, followed him to the swarming curb.\"I--I don\\'t know how to thank you,\" she said.\"Then don\\'t try,\" returned Dyker, laughing easily.  \"You can make itall right with me when you testify against Rose.\"She kept his hand a moment longer, partly in fear of the humanmultitude about her and partly in genuine gratitude.\"But I do thank you,\" she said.Dyker, not too well liking the white light of publicity in which thislittle scene was being enacted, pressed her hand and dropped it.\"That\\'s all right,\" he responded.  \"Just don\\'t forget your promise.\"He stepped back into the cab.  \"Good-by, and good luck,\" he said.\"Good-by,\" he heard her answer, and then, with his head out of thecab-window, he saw her pause bewilderedly.  \"To your right,\" hecautioned.He watched her turn.  He saw her plunge into the crowd.  He saw thecrowd swallow her up.\"Take me over to my office,\" he ordered the driver, and added hisaddress.Once there, he dismissed the cab, climbed the steps of what seemed anold and modest little house, and, opening the door and turning intothe front room, lit a gas-jet the flame of which revealed anapartment surprisingly new and arrogant.  The walls were lined withnew bookcases holding rows of new law-books, and surrounded by rowsof new chairs.  The flat-top desk in the center, at which hisstenographer sat by daylight, was a new desk, with new wire-basketsupon it, and a new telephone, to which Dyker now immediatelyproceeded and called a number.\"Hello,\" he said into the transmitter, adopting the low tone that healways used in his wired conversations.  \"Is that Schleger\\'s?--Itis?--That you, Ludwig?--This is Dyker.--Yes, good-evening,Ludwig.--Yes, pretty good, thank you.  How are you, and how\\'sbusiness?--That\\'s good.  Mrs. Schleger and the babies allright?--I\\'ll bet that boy\\'s gained three pounds!--He has?  I\\'m gladto hear it.  You\\'re a wonder.--Yes.--That\\'s what I said.  And, say,Ludwig, is O\\'Malley anywhere around?--He isn\\'t?--Hasn\\'t been in thisevening?--Oh!  Well, I wonder where I can find him.--You don\\'t?Perhaps he\\'s at Dugan\\'s place.--No, it\\'s not anything important: Ijust wanted to take a drink with him, that\\'s all.  He\\'s sure to be atDugan\\'s or Venturio\\'s, but I guess I won\\'t bother.  Ever so muchobliged, Ludwig.--Good-by.\"In spite of his word, Dyker did, however, bother.  He called threeother numbers in his quest of the political boss, and when he foundhim, the underling made a pressing appointment for an importantconference on the next morning, though what it was that he wantedthen to discuss he carefully neglected to mention over atelephone-wire.He hung up the receiver in a glow of satisfaction.\"And now,\" he said, \"I think I\\'ll get away for the night.  I don\\'tcare to have any arguments with Rose for a day or two.\"Yet, even as he said it, the telephone-bell uttered its staccatosummons.  He stood uncertainly beside the desk.\"She wouldn\\'t have the nerve to use the wire,\" he argued.  \"Perhapsit\\'s O\\'Malley with more to say.\"Again the bell rang, and his curiosity overcame his caution.  He tookup the receiver.\"Hello!\" he said sharply, and then his tone mellowed, for the voicethat came to him across the hurrying New York night was the voice ofMarian Lennox.\"Is that Mr. Dyker\\'s office?\" it asked.\"It is the head of the firm himself,\" he answered, \"and mighty gladto hear from you.\"\"I am glad you\\'re glad,\" the voice pursued, \"because I want to ask afavor.\"\"It is as good as performed.  What is it?\"\"I have been down town, and remained longer than I intended, and Iwant you, please, to take me home.\"\"I thought you were asking a favor, not bestowing one.  Where areyou?\"\"At the settlement.\"\"In Rivington Street?\"  Wesley set his teeth as he asked it.\"Yes.\"\"Very well, I\\'ll be over right away.\"He rang off and left the office.  He was sorry that he had dismissedthe cab, for he expected to need it when he reached the first stageof his journey; but the way was not long to the place that Marian hadnamed, and, even had it been twice as far to the settlement, Dyker,who walked thither with the feet of chagrin, would not have remarkedthe distance.In the midst of Rivington Street, in a house that used, long ago, tobe a Methodist parsonage, a little group of devoted women are doingtheir best to redeem, by social activities, the people of theneighborhood from the benighted condition in which the people\\'s lotis cast.  This best has now been done for more years than a few, andthe people, still considering it necessary to remain alive, and stillknowing that to remain alive they must submit to the economic systemimposed upon them, continue discouragingly unredeemed.  But thedevoted women, though they neglect the disease for its symptoms,persist as only feminine natures can persist.They are college-bred women with the limitations and emancipations oftheir class; and they have a great deal to occupy their attentionbesides their essays in social entertainment.  For the most part theypass their days in really practical investigation.  One of them willinspect the public schools and impartially consider curricula andventilation.  Another will visit tenements and ask housewivespersonal questions for the tabular benefit of the Russell SageFoundation.  A third goes into the laundries of the best hotels andfinds that these hostelries force their washerwomen to sleep twentyin a room.  Yet, when they return to Rivington Street, these daylightinvestigators spur their wearied nerves to further exertion and goforward, not to teach the toilers the practical cause and remedy ofthe economic evil, but to form the boys and girls, the young womenand young men, into reading groups, debating clubs, sewing circles,cooking classes, and elocutionary juntas.  Their zeal is boundless,their martyrdom sadly genuine, and, if there is humor, there issomething more than humor in their ultimate complaint:\"Some of our people we retain, but most of them slip away, and, evenwith the best of fortune, we seem, somehow, able to do so little.\"Dyker knew the place by reputation.  He had always scorned it for itsown sake, and now he had come to hate it for Marian\\'s.  For want of abetter term, it may be repeated that he was in love with Marian.Moreover, he wished the assistance that an early marriage with thedaughter of a wealthy department-store owner would give him in thecoming campaign.  And, finally, his peculiar legal activities werealready well enough known on the East Side to make it probable thatany young woman entering the settlement would speedily learn of them.After the night of the opera his cooler reflection had rejectedMarian\\'s plan of joining the Rivington Street colony as a ferventlygirlish dream destined to fade before the reality of action.  He haddecided that the best way to aid its dissipation was no longer tocombat it, and he had even, during the months that had followed, seenMarian but rarely, and never alone.  Occupied with politics andknowing the tactical value of restraint, he had not so much aspressed his wooing.  He had relied upon what he chose to describe ashis sweetheart\\'s basic commonsense to work out their commonsalvation, and had decided that, this commonsense being what heesteemed it, Marian was a woman more likely to be won by a Fabiancampaign than by a Varric attack.The point wherein these calculations erred was their underestimationof the momentum of a girlish impulse.  That method of considerationwhich makes one slow to reach convictions works beyond theconvictions and retards one from action upon them, once they areachieved, but the impulsive mind that bolts a creed unmasticatedstraightway drives its owner, in the creed\\'s behalf, to thethumbscrews or the wrack.  It is from the pods of half-baked opinionsthat there is shaken the seed of the church: Marian meant to keep toher purpose.Perhaps Wesley\\'s silence and the subtle sense of pique that itawakened played a part in this; perhaps the purpose wasself-sufficient; but, in either case, Marian missed scarcely anevening at the settlement.  Two of her former classmates wereknee-deep in the work there, and what she saw and what they told herserved only to confirm her.  It thus happened that, anxious again tosee him alone, and more anxious to let him know the endurance of herresolution, she had, on this evening, telephoned on the chance offinding him late at his office.\"Good heavens!\" he gasped as she met him at the settlement\\'s door.\"What on earth are you doing in this part of town at this hour of thenight?  Let me \\'phone for a taxi.\"What, as a matter of fact, she had been doing was to listen to slimlittle Luigi Malatesta and fat little Morris Binderwitz respectivelyattacking and defending the proposition that Abraham Lincoln was agreater American than George Washington; but what she thought she hadbeen doing was assisting in raising the lower half of society.  Underthis impression, her fine brown eyes shone with the consciousness ofmoral rectitude, her mouth was even more than usually firm, and herhead even more than usually like some delicate cameo.\"One thing at a time, please,\" she imperturbably answered.  \"First,no taxicab.  It isn\\'t far to Second Avenue, which is quiet enough,and I want to walk for a few blocks.\"She took the arm that he grimly offered, and he began to break hisway through the noisy crowd under the flaring gasoline lamps of thepush-carts.  Coherent conversation was at first impossible, but Dykerfelt a glow of pride as, with her fingers closed in tight trust uponhim, he shouldered a passage for her, and Marian herself was notinsusceptible to the thrill inherent in the situation.  Nevertheless,the girl, as soon as they had turned northward, reverted to herformer attitude; and the man, knowing well that all this meant thatshe was still determined upon a course necessarily delaying hiswooing and perhaps resulting in his discovery, frankly resumed hisopposition.  He did more and worse: he swept aside all his method ofsilence, all his plans of conquest through non-resistance.\"Now,\" he said, continuing their interrupted talk, \"I should reallylike to know what you, of all people in the world, were doing onRivington Street.\"\"I was there,\" she announced serenely, \"because I have made up mymind that it is I, of all people in the world, who ought to be there.\"\"Marian,\"--he almost stopped as he said it--\"are you really inearnest about this fancy?  Do you honestly mean that you areseriously considering any such chimerical course?\"He had, naturally, chosen precisely the tone that, were anyadditional incentive required, would have compelled her toresolution.  Her mind, as it chanced, was, however, made up, and whathe now said served only to turn her toward that feminine logic whichassumes as done that which is determined.\"I am past consideration,\" she said.  \"I have already virtuallybegun.\"\"Marian!  You\\'re joking.\"\"I am simply stating a fact.  Why do you suppose I have been stayingin town this summer?  I begin my real work at the settlement with thefirst of next week.\"Her classmates in Rivington Street, could they have heard this, wouldhave been pleased, but they would also have been surprised.Nevertheless, she at once mentally decided to make good herdeclaration.In the darkness Dyker bit the lip that, under his short, crispmustache, trembled with vexation.\"You really mean that?\"She bowed a brief assent.\"Then what, if you please, do you propose to do when you get there?\"As to that Marian found herself suddenly certain.\"You ought to know,\" she said, \"how these people are living; youought to know how the girls--hundreds and hundreds of them--are everyweek going into lives of shame and death.  I mean to do what I can tostop them.\"It would have been a hard thing for her to say to him had he notwrought upon her anger, and had not the freshness of her partialglimpse of earth\\'s lower seven-eighths fired her heart with a blindinspiration.  She had the partial vision that makes the martyr: avision that shows just enough of an evil to confirm the necessity ofaction and not enough to prove how little individual actionindividually directed can be worth.For the second time Wesley gasped.  Here were depths in her of whichhe had not dreamed, and because he had not dreamed of them he wouldnot admit them.\"But you can\\'t!\" he protested.  \"It is impossible that you should.It\\'s inconceivable that a woman of your delicacy should go into suchcoarse work!\"\"Is it better that it should be left to coarse women?  It seems to methat there has been enough of coarseness in it already.\"\"But this--why, it\\'s something that one can\\'t even speak about!\"\"Yes, something that we are not permitted even to mention, Wesley;and because we aren\\'t permitted even to mention it, the thing growsand grows, night by night.  It thrives in the shadow of our silence.They tell me that the liquor laws are broken, because nobody willmention it; that bestial men get rich in it, because nobody willmention it; that in this city alone there are three hundred saloondance-halls intended to furnish its supply, because nobody willmention it!\"Figuratively, Dyker threw up his hands in horror, but actually, likeall desperate men, he seized at the straws of detail.\"Now, that just shows how wrong your view of the whole subjecthappens to be,\" he declared.  \"My work has put me in a position toknow something about these dance-halls, and I know that they existsimply because the girls that go to them want them to exist--thegirls, mark you; not the men.  Why, the girls aren\\'t taken to suchplaces; they go of themselves, they pay their own admission, and itis the usual thing for a girl earning six dollars a week in a storeto save fifty cents out of every salary-envelope for the dance-halls.\"\"Then you want me to conclude that the fact that they want to do thething makes the thing right?\"\"You don\\'t understand----\"\"Precisely; and so I mean to learn.\"\"You can\\'t learn.  No matter how closely you study this whole matter,you can\\'t learn, Marian.  How can a clean-hearted, clean-livedAmerican girl ever get the point of view of these low-down,low-browed foreigners?  It\\'s the sort of thing they\\'re used to.\"\"Before they begin it?\"\"It\\'s the survival of the fittest.\"\"Then can\\'t some be made more fit to survive?\"\"It\\'s the law of life, and it can\\'t be stopped.\"\"So was negro slavery the law of life.  It couldn\\'t be stoppedeither--until we stopped it.\"\"That is all theory, Marian; it won\\'t work out in practice.  Thegreat point is that these unfortunate women, whether they becomeunfortunate through the dance-halls or anywhere else, are simply notour sort of clay: they\\'re not Americans.\"\"They are human beings.\"\"A pretty low example.\"\"And they are more Americans than your ancestors or mine were threehundred years ago.\"\"Nonsense.  They\\'re different, I tell you--different.  Seriously, Iknow what I am talking about: I speak from systematic investigations,reports, statistics.  The very latest investigation shows that allbut about thirteen per cent. of these women were either born abroador else are the children of foreign parents.  It is always the newestimmigrants that swell the ranks, and of course the newest immigrantsare our lowest type.\"\"I don\\'t see that all this alters the question.\"\"Well, it does.\"\"The lower they are, the more plainly it is our duty to raise them.\"\"My dear Marian, how can you raise them when you don\\'t understandthem?\"Marian shook her handsome head.\"You _will_ come back to that,\" she said; \"and all that I can answeris that, not being utterly stupid, and having come to understand afew abstract problems, I have hopes of mastering something so closeat hand to me and so concrete as a fellow human being.\"\"What, for instance?\" asked Wesley, \"can you understand of thetypical Jewish girl of the East Side?\"\"A good deal, I think.  They were talking about that type at thesettlement this evening.  We were looking from the front windows atan endless stream of Jewish girls tramping home from the factorieswhere they worked to the tenements where they slept.  Somebody saidthere are nearly four hundred thousand Jews living east of theBowery; that in most Jewish families the ambition to which everycomfort must be sacrificed is the education of the boys; that forthis reason the girls must work and are worked until there is nowhereelse in the world where so much labor is got out of young women, andyet that the Jewess that is not married and a mother before she istwenty is regarded as a family disgrace.  It seems to me, Wesley,that the case of those girls is pretty easy to understand.  It seemsto me that they are on the horns of a rather ugly dilemma.\"Dyker\\'s cane whipped the air as if it were striking at the heads ofopposing arguments.\"You accept as gospel,\" he said, \"everything that is told you byanybody but me.  It isn\\'t a pleasant subject, but, if you insist uponfacts, let me tell you that there are troops of Jewesses who comedown here from the upper Ghetto and walk the streets for no otherpurpose than to get money for their wedding trousseaus.\"It was a blow at her conventions, and she shuddered; but she stood byher guns.  They had crossed down Twenty-sixth Street now and theyturned into the quiet of Madison Avenue, among comfortable houses andsilent churches, as she answered.\"If they do that,\" she said, \"it is because they have to.\"\"Have to?  Why on earth should they have to?\"\"I don\\'t know, but I know that the very use they make of the moneyshows what they do is only a means and not an end.\"\"Are trousseaus so necessary that these girls have to sell theirsouls for them?\"\"Souls have been sold for less.  Even you and I make considerablesacrifices for things that other people in other classes would notthink needful at all.\"He had done his best to bridle his annoyance, but now he could bridleit no longer.  He was wholly sincere in his inability to takeseriously either the girl or her point of view, and now, though hefelt as if he were riding a hunter at a butterfly, he charged blindly.\"Oh, please don\\'t let us jump at sentiment and theory,\" heremonstrated; \"let us keep our feet on figures and fact.  The figuresgrow with the population; they always have so grown and they alwayswill so grow.  And the plain fact is that, though a few good peoplehave been trying to stop this thing for four thousand years, theyhave never succeeded in doing anything but soiling themselves in theattempt.\"\"I know that,\" she frankly acknowledged, \"and I don\\'t know what it isthat\\'s to blame; but I know that there isn\\'t any evil that hasn\\'tsome cure if we can only find it out.\"\"Then why not leave the search for a cure to the experienced?\"\"I shall; but I propose to become one of the experienced.  I mean togive my time, at least for a while, to first-hand study.  Perhapsthen I shall learn enough to know that it\\'s useless for me to go on,but I shall keep trying to go on until I am convinced that thereisn\\'t any use in the trying.\"\"That\\'s absurd, Marian--simply absurd.  The condition is, after all,one that must be dealt with by the law, and I tell you honestly that,as yet, even the law is helpless.\"\"Has the law really tried?  Has it ever attempted, for instance, todo anything to the men that take these immigrant girls at the dockand make slaves of them?\"\"Yes, it has; it has tried just that.  In Chicago two men werearrested for taking a couple of such girls--they had brought themfrom New York--and when the case was appealed, the United StatesSupreme Court found that, though importation of girls was a violationof federal law, yet the federal law providing a punishment for merely_harboring_ such girls after their arrival was unconstitutional.\"Marian\\'s voice faltered.\"Is--is that true?\" she asked.\"Absolutely,\" said Dyker.  Like most lawyers of his generation, hisideas of what was right were limited only by the final decisions ofwhat was legal, and if the Supreme Court of the United States had, byeven a majority of one, declared that the sun moved around the earth,Dyker would have first denied and then forgotten all previousastronomy.\"Absolutely,\" he repeated, and awaited her capitulation.But Marian did not capitulate.  She merely drew a long breath andanswered:\"After all, that, of course, is just a small portion of the bigquestion, and the only way it moves me is to lessen my opinion of theSupreme Court.\"It was Wesley\\'s turn to gasp, and he did so.  He had always suspectedthat these college-settlements were hotbeds of Socialism andAnarchy--two theories that, to Dyker, were one and the same--and nowhe had his confirmation.He was too cynically wrong upon one side of their subject to realizehow emotionally wrong she, in her hope of accomplishment throughpersonal appeal, might be upon the other.  But here was a concretedenial of his one sincere conviction, and, though he was at last calmenough to see that he must not allow this conviction to wreck hissuit, he was not so calm as to maintain a clear judgment.  It wasplain that Marian would not be turned from her experiment.  His bestcourse was, he then reasoned, immediately to put on record hisopinion of its futility, even to quarrel with her in defense of thatopinion, and then, when experience brought the awakening upon whichhis own worldly experience counted, to stand ready to profit by theinevitable reaction that would most likely show the perfidy of thewomen whom Marian hoped to help, detract from the credibility of anygossip they might recount concerning him, and end by winning him hiswife.\"All right,\" he said sharply, \"it is perfectly useless to talkreasonably to anybody that can take such a view of so simple amatter.  Here is Thirty-fourth Street.  I think we had better walkover to Broadway and get that taxi.\"The worst thing that a man can impute to a handsome woman is a lackof intellect.  Marian\\'s cheeks flushed.\"I quite agree with you,\" she replied.  \"I am utterly incapable ofarguing with anybody that so confuses law and justice.\"\"Very well,\" said Dyker; \"but I want you to remember what I have saidupon the subject as a whole.  When you have trusted these women andbeen betrayed by them, when they have poisoned your mind against allthe principles you have been brought up to believe, when you haveleft the world of sentiment and bruised your poor hands withhammering at the door of fact, then you will acknowledge that I havebeen right.  I am not angry----\"\"Oh, of course not!\"\"I am not angry, but I am firm.  I only ask you to believe that Ishall never be far away from the settlement, and that you have onlyto telephone for me when you have need of me.\"Marian compressed her lips to a more severe firmness, and the ridefrom Thirty-fourth Street to Riverside Drive was made in silence; butthe following Monday found her, against all parental protests,enlisted as a settlement-worker in Rivington Street.XVIMPARTIAL JUSTICEMichael M. O\\'Malley, political boss, held his court, that nextmorning, in the back room of Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon on SecondAvenue, and, because it was to be a busy day and there were manypleas to be made and many petitions to be received, he came early tohis post.As he swung majestically up the street toward his destination, hiscarefully pressed light gray suit flapping in the warm breeze about afigure so tall and so thin that any suit approaching \"a fit\" wouldhave achieved only a caricature, his progress was almost regal.Pedestrians stepped to one side as if the bulk of his unseen dignitydemanded a far wider strip of the paved channel than was required byhis visible physique.  Workingmen touched their grimy caps, theoverseers of the street-repairing gangs bowed respectfully, childrenon their way to school bobbed their heads, and, at a corner, OfficerRiley, concluding a substitute week \"on the day turn,\" offered hisbest military salute.  The keeper of every news-stand received a nod;the bootblacks outside of each saloon were given a brief word ofgreeting; there was not a beggar but got some largess, and of theseveral men that hurried up with a request, hinted or expressed, allwere permitted to walk a few steps in the august presence, allreceived a brief, civil phrase of agreement, postponement, orconsideration.\"Trouble about your place?\"  It was thus that O\\'Malley interruptedthe voluble plea of a saloon-keeper that approached him.  \"I\\'ll havethat cop, Conners, looked into.  His eyes are too new; they seemore\\'n they\\'re paid to see.  Who\\'s tendin\\' day-bar for you?  JohnnyMager?  All right, if they take the thing up front, I\\'ll see that youget your license transferred in his name.  Keep your shirt on an\\'leave it to me.\"He had not paused in his walk; he had not raised his quiet voice orquickened his slow speech; but the suppliant retired satisfied,reassured.Indeed, O\\'Malley\\'s face was one that, if it would not inspireconfidence in a stranger unacquainted with the man\\'s reputation forguarding the interests of his dependents, at least bore theunmistakable stamp of that knowledge of life which is power.  It wassallow and long, with a long thin nose and long thin lips, and coldeyes that thrust as swiftly and as deeply as the stilettos of Mr.O\\'Malley\\'s Italian constituents.  He smiled often and his smile wasbitter; he spoke little and his words were short; but his servantshad early learned that he was as sure to keep his promise as he wasready to give it, and that, so long as his tasks were well done, hewas an indulgent master.He entered \"Schleger\\'s place\" with the air of an owner, nodded to thewhite-jacketed man behind the polished counter and before thepolished mirror, and gave a quick, firm pressure to the plump,outstretched hand of the fat and grinning proprietor.\"All well with the family?\" he asked, smiling his wry smile.Ludwig Schleger beamed assent.\"Anything doing last night?\"\"Nothin\\',\" replied Ludwig.  \"\\'Ceptin\\' Mr. Dyker called you on thetelephone.  Wouldn\\'t say what he wanted.\"\"I know that.  Haven\\'t had any more roughhousing?\"\"No,\" grinned Schleger, wisely; \"the boys are all got wise that theycan\\'t meddle with my new night-man.\"\"I see.  Name\\'s Hermann Hoffmann, ain\\'t it?\"\"That\\'s right.\"\"Hum.  Well, he may be useful.  You must get him to move into thisprecinct, or else register him from here.  Votes right, of course?\"\"I ain\\'t asked him yet.\"\"Do it to-night.\"O\\'Malley walked to the dimly lighted back-room, hung with racingprints and framed lithographs advertising a wide variety of whiskeys.He drew a wicker-bottomed chair to a stained round table, and satdown.The proprietor brought him a glass and a syphon of seltzer--theboss\\'s only drink--and disappeared.  The bar-keeper came with ahandful of black cigars for which O\\'Malley paid with a bill, refusingthe change, and also disappeared.  Then the door of communication wasshut and guarded, admission being denied to all persons not properlyaccredited, and the quiet, thin man in the light gray suit, nowsipping his seltzer, now reflectively adjusting his bright blue tie,which bore a brilliant diamond pin, and always slowly smoking, beganhis conference with such callers as he had granted appointments.They came in force--alone and in groups--all manner of men by themain entrance and a woman or two ushered through a side door.  Thisone was promised a reward for duty to be done, that one assigned tothe performance of a delicate piece of diplomacy.  Now and then ashort, sharp, cold reprimand for negligence or failure sent away acaller whipped, penitent, trembling; and here and there release waspromised for a wayward son sent to \"The Island,\" or a line of creditwritten for use at a grocer\\'s shop.Wesley Dyker came early.  He paused at the bar for a drink to stiffenhis courage, lingered a little longer until a predecessor had beendismissed, and then, his lids lowered, entered, alone, with asuccinct account of Rose\\'s attempt to play a double game.When he had finished the narrative, O\\'Malley sat for a while gazingunconcernedly at the blackened ceiling, and smoking quietly.\"Well?\" he said at last, and turned the sharp thrust of his gaze uponhis caller.Dyker, who was sitting opposite and who had been served with a drinkof whiskey, tossed off the liquor in order to gain time to muster ananswer for this unexpected query.\"Well,\" he at length replied, annoyed at thus being put into aposition where he must make his proposition in the form of a request,\"are you going to stand for that sort of thing?\"\"I dunno.\"\"_I_ wouldn\\'t stand for it,\" said Dyker.\"If you had my job you might have to.\"There was another pause.  The long fingers of O\\'Malley tapped gentlyon the table.  Dyker shifted uneasily in his seat.\"I wouldn\\'t stand for it a minute!\" he at last broke forth.  \"Andwhat\\'s more, you can have her up for something worse than thedisorderly-house charge.  She has one kidnapped girl in her housenow, and I\\'ve got another that escaped from her, and who\\'s ready totestify.\"An instant later he was sorry that he had spoken so readily.O\\'Malley tilted back against the wall until the front legs of hischair rose six inches from the floor.  He blew an easy ring of smoke.\"You seem to have come here with your case all prepared,\" he remarked.Wesley flushed and stammered.\"You see,\" he began, \"I mean that I got hot at this, and I said tomyself that it was only right to let you know this woman wasn\\'t to bedepended upon.\"The forward legs of O\\'Malley\\'s chair came down with a loud thump.Wesley started, but the boss only impaled him with another coldglance.\"See here,\" said he, \"before we can do business we\\'d betteraltogether understand each other.  Just what is it you want?\"\"I--I think I\\'ve made that clear.\"\"_I_ think not.\"\"I want this Légère woman pinched for running a white-slave place.  Iwant to see her taught a lesson that the other women down her waywill profit by.\"\"Of course you do.  But what do you want for yourself?\"The issue was too conclusively joined to permit of further evasion.Wesley took his courage in his hands.\"Why, I\\'ve not made any secret of that,\" he said, \"and neither hasheadquarters.  I want the next election for magistrate.  I told youthat long ago.\"He launched his declaration with the bravado of weakness at bay, andthen breathlessly awaited the answer.Michael O\\'Malley leaned back again in his chair, clasped his handsbehind his head, and closed his keen eyes, reflecting.His was an hereditary office, but, unlike most men that inheritpower, he had inherited also the abilities that had gained the power.His father, who had begun life as a policeman, had been a greatexemplar of the political uses of an element fully realized only bythe expert politician: the human element.  The name of O\\'Malley hadnow for a generation been, south of Fourteenth Street, a magic title.To a legion of men, women, and children, it stood for a sort ofsubstitute, and very near and practical, Providence.  It impliedcontact, fellow-feeling, the personal relation.  Acting upon thepolitician\\'s axiom that whatever is acquired is right, the elderO\\'Malley had risen from the street force until, after zealousparty-work, he had been promoted, in the palmy days of policy and thepool-rooms, to the \"Gambling Squad,\" where he had performed theastounding financial feat of saving eight times his monthly salary,had retired, and grown annually richer and stronger through politics,without once losing the esteem of his voting underlings, or onceseeming to cease being one of them.  Since his father\\'s death, nowthat gambling had declined and prostitution had risen as politicalmaterial, Michael, who had been brought up to the business, hadfilled the place of that genuinely mourned parent.  Without anypublicly acknowledged means of support, even with no headquarterssave the daily shifted back-rooms of saloons, he had extended andincreased the power and the fortune that had been left to him.  Hewas known as the friend of the distressed; he was recognized asbenefiting with his left hand the poor whom he unimpededly robbedwith his right.  To those who were without money or withoutassistance he was always accessible.  He made festival with the merryand was readily sympathetic with them that mourned.  By small giftsat all times and large gifts in days of emergency, by acting as theadviser, the employment-agent, the defender, from the law, of thepeople whom he exploited and upon whose weaknesses and vices hethrove, he won and held fast both the tribute and the allegiance ofthe vicious and the weak.It was a mighty position and yet one that, in moments like thepresent, was inherently delicate, one in which the fortunate man mustmove warily lest in gaining a new friend he lose an old.  It is allvery well to be temperate and profit by drunkenness, to be abstemiousand take money from prostitution; it is easy to give presents atChristmas and picnics in summer when the giving is in reality onlypaying a small rebate to wives for drunken husbands, to mothers fordaughters stolen.  It is easy to find a place in the municipalgovernment for the man that stuffs a ballot-box for you, or theprocurer that registers your fraudulent votes from the houses of hiscustomers; but it is fatal to punish, for what may be a passingdisloyalty, anyone that your world, perhaps ignorant that offense hasbeen committed, regards as having been placed by a careless Heavenunder your protecting wing,--fatal, that is to say, unless youacquire something more than you throw away.Of all this, though scarcely with such frankness of phrase, MichaelO\\'Malley made thought before he gave Dyker the reply for which thatclever young lawyer was waiting.  Behind his closed eyes he weighedthe chances carefully: the things to be gained against the thingsthat might be lost.Then he thoughtfully lit another black cigar.\"You\\'ve got to keep out of personal relations with these women,\" heyawned.Dyker bit his lip.\"I don\\'t have them,\" he replied.\"Yes, you do.  Cut \\'em out.  Understand?\"Surprisedly, angrily, Dyker found himself bowing obedience, like aschool-urchin detected in some breach of academic discipline.\"A woman with a past,\" continued O\\'Malley, \"is all right for thepresent, but a slow mare in the futurity.\"\"I dare say you\\'re correct,\" said Wesley Dyker.  With a single blowof the whip, the master had demonstrated his mastery.O\\'Malley smoked a while longer in silence.\"Now then,\" he at last pursued, \"about this magistracy.  You thinkthe boys\\'ll stand for you?\"\"I think they will,\" Wesley replied, with humble mien, but risingassurance.  \"And I think it ought to make the ticket look better tothe uptown people to have--if you will pardon my saying so--my sortof name on it.\"O\\'Malley grunted.\"Don\\'t you worry about the looks of the ticket, or the value of yoursort of a name,\" he said.  \"The kid-glove game is played out; it\\'sonly the monkey who\\'s always hopping about on his family-tree.\"Dyker\\'s courage ebbed again, but he knew that to stand upon hisdignity was to be overthrown.\"At all events,\" he persisted, \"I am pretty well known hereabouts bythis time, and I think honestly that I am pretty well liked.\"O\\'Malley nodded.  He knew more about that than Dyker knew.  Dykerhad, with more or less direct assistance from O\\'Malley\\'s ownheadquarters, already won some prominence for himself, and had beenof some use to the organization, in that sort of legal-practice whichis a highly specialized branch of the profession on the lower EastSide.  The purpose of that branch is simply the protection of thecriminal, especially the criminal engaged in the procuring orconfining of slave-girls, but its methods, far from being unusual,are merely a daring extension of the methods that, within the lastdecade, have increased in popularity among the seemingly morerespectable practitioners.  Evidence is manufactured or destroyed,according to immediate needs; favorable witnesses are taughtfavorable testimony; postponements are secured until a politicallyindebted judge is on the bench.  There follows a formal bellowingagainst what are called invasions of inalienable personal rights, andthen there comes a matter-of-course acquittal.  With Dyker\\'s abilityin this sort of work O\\'Malley was thoroughly familiar; for this man\\'sparty-services he was sufficiently grateful, and with the chance ofthe lawyer\\'s rise to a popularity that would be of still further helphe was well satisfied.\"If you\\'d be elected,\" he at length reflectively remarked, \"you\\'dhave a mighty responsible position, Dyker.\"\"I know that.\"\"There would be a good many ways\"--O\\'Malley knocked, with greatdeliberation, the ash from his cigar--\"a good many ways in which youcould help the party--if you\\'d be elected.\"He seemed to be discussing, disinterestedly, a purely abstractquestion; but Dyker did not miss his meaning.\"I shouldn\\'t overlook them,\" he said.\"And, _if you\\'d be elected_, there\\'d be a lot of ways in which youmight hurt--the party.\"\"I scarcely think you have any just cause for apprehension upon thatscore, Mr. O\\'Malley.  I think that my record speaks for itself.  Myrecord is regular; it is an open book to the whole city----\"\"Never mind that, Dyker; it\\'s an open book to me, anyhow.\"\"I\\'m aware of it; but then----\"\"All I want to know is two things.\"\"And they are, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\"First, are you the kind that lose their head over a good thing andland in jail?\"\"Does my law-practice seem to indicate that I should be likely tooverstep legal limits?\"\"No, I guess it don\\'t.  But you can\\'t always tell; we can\\'t afford nohogs; and that sort of a man gives all his friends a black eye.\"\"But I say to you----\"\"And next, I want to know, Mr. Dyker, whether you\\'re the kind of aman that don\\'t forget them that put him where he\\'s at.\"The low, slow spoken sentence ended with a sudden click of Mr.O\\'Malley\\'s long, vulpine jaws.  He leaned quickly forward across thetable and fixed Wesley with the stiletto of his eyes.Dyker met that gaze steadily.  He leaned, in his turn, towardO\\'Malley, and his own voice dropped to a whisper.  There was anexchange of a dozen sentences, and the two men had arrived at aperfect understanding: Dyker was as good as elected.O\\'Malley pressed the call-button.\"Billy,\" he said to the bar-keeper, \"have somebody run out and bringin Larry Riley off his beat.  I want to see him.\"As the bar-keeper nodded and disappeared, Dyker started to rise.\"I don\\'t know whether Riley had better see me here,\" he said.\"Rose\\'s house is on his regular beat.\"\"All the more reason to sit tight,\" replied the comprehendingO\\'Malley.  \"What\\'s the use of gettin\\' square with a person unless theperson knows who done it?\"\"But I am not sure that Riley would be a safe man to confide this to.He\\'s naturally a friend of Rose\\'s.\"\"He\\'s more of a friend of mine.\"The officer entered a minute later, his flushed face gravelyattentive, his helmet in his hand.\"Riley,\" said O\\'Malley, \"you know this Légère woman.\"\"I do that, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir.\"\"Well, she\\'s been gettin\\' too gay.  When you go off duty, you tellJim to have her place pinched to-night.\"Riley\\'s cheeks became a shade less red.\"It\\'s sorry I am to hear, sir, that she\\'s been misbehavin\\' ofherself,\" he murmured.\"Sure you\\'re sorry.  Tell Jim to get there early: we don\\'t wantnobody but the women.\"\"What\"--Riley wet his dry lips--\"What\\'s the charge?\"\"Runnin\\' a white-slave joint.  You\\'re to be sure to get a girl shehas in the third floor back.\"O\\'Malley\\'s tone had been conclusive; it indicated that the interviewwas at an end; but the big officer stood twirling his helmet betweenhis large hands.\"Mr. O\\'Malley, sir?\" he began.\"What is it, Riley?\"\"There\\'s nothin\\' else?\"\"Nuthin\\'.\"\"An\\'--there ain\\'t no other way out of it for Mrs. Légère?\"\"No, there ain\\'t.  But you can report her house and get the credityourself, Riley.\"\"Thank ye kindly, sir; but if ye don\\'t mind, sir, I think I\\'d ratherlet someone get it as nades it more.  Ye see, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir, thishere Mrs. Légère has been powerful kind to me, an\\'----\"\"All right, have it your own way.\"\"I--I can\\'t do nothin\\' for her, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\"Not this time.  That\\'s all, Riley.--And, Riley----\"The thin boss stood up and crossed to the bulky policeman.  His voicewas still low and soft.\"Yis, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\"If that woman gets wind of this an\\' makes a getaway, I\\'ll have youruniform off you so God damned quick you\\'ll wish I\\'d skinned youalive.\"\"Yis, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir,\" said the officer.  \"No fear of that, sir.\"But he left the audience-chamber with a heavy heart.  He lived thelife that he was compelled to live, and he did what he was ordered todo, but he could not without compunction turn upon one that hadbought a right to his own and his superior\\'s protection.There was not a little silent bitterness in his heart as, later,returning to the station-house, he thought upon these things.  Heremembered the days when he had been new upon the force.  Those werethe days when the popular tide had turned against gambling and, amidthe raids that meant the breaking of steel doors, the pursuit ofoffenders through secret passages and across steep roofs, it was fora while possible for a policeman to retain his ideals.  But heremembered also how, when the ruling powers had thus been forced todestroy the nests where once they had gathered golden eggs, the longarm of necessity swung slowly backward until it paused at the pointwhere it had since remained and, because the eggs must be gatheredsomewhere, the police were expected to gather them from the aeries ofthe vultures that preyed upon women.Riley had not minded, every pay-day, handing over to the appointedheeler the five dollars wherefor he received a receipt for a dollarand a half as dues to the political club to which he was expected tobelong.  For quite some time he had been content with closing hiseyes to saloons that were opened on Sundays by proprietors that werepowerful, and with allowing others to profit by the rewards of hisvoluntary blindness.  But at last there came the first baby in theRiley home, and then the second, and the wife\\'s long illness; andthen assessments were increased and, finally, after many a broad hintfrom the men higher up, he was given plainly to understand that hemust either hand over a goodly portion of money, every week, from theoffending women on his beat, or else lose his usefulness to the force.After that, he took what he must and kept what he could.  He had notrade on which to fall back; his domestic and political expenses grewannually, and, as an evasion of the former meant financial ruin, sothe shirking of the latter meant a charge lodged at headquarters, aspeedy hearing, and an automatic dismissal.  Even when a non-partisanman was put at the head of the department, that official\\'s practicalpower was nullified by the fact that the mayor, a party-man, wasbehind him and could remove him at a moment\\'s notice, and that behindthe mayor was the organization that had made and could break themayor.  No individual, so far as Officer Riley could see, waspersonally to blame, was himself a free agent; but the wholecollection of individuals were the irresponsible parts of a giganticmachine--from the inner council of Tammany to their spies in everymunicipal department--which, if ever broken by the recognized partyof opposition, must be so thoroughly rebuilt and so preciselyoperated in accordance with mechanical lines that the change wouldsignify only the casting out of the irresponsible parts and theirreplacement by parts equally irresponsible.  Riley could look nofarther, and, even could he have seen that the remedy must be aremedy of conditions, he could have done nothing to free himself.At the station-house he delivered the commands that O\\'Malley hadgiven him.  There his words produced consternation, but no thought ofdisaffection.  The patrol-wagon was ordered to be in its stable,ready to leave at the given hour, and Riley, as the officer regularlyassigned to night-work on the beat in which stood Rose\\'s house, wasforced to remain to accompany it.\"An\\' see here, you men,\"--these were the words with which the briefinstructions were concluded--\"you see to it nobody gets ahead of you.This is O\\'Malley\\'s job, an\\' it\\'s got to be done right.\"In the underworld of every city, news, however, travels even while itis in the making, and in no direction does it travel more swiftly,just as in no other does it travel more indirectly, than, when theslave-trade is concerned, it travels to the traders.  Riley wascareful to remain in full view of the sergeant\\'s desk from the momentthe arrangements were made until the time of execution--he would nothave dared to communicate with the friends that had thus swiftlybecome the enemy--none of the wagon-crew were seen to leave thestable, to use the telephone, or to speak to a passerby, and yet,shortly before the appointed time, through a certain club-room over anot far distant saloon--a club-room much affected by young men in MaxGrossman\\'s profession--there soon spread the definite tidings thatRosie Légère had just been \"piped off.\"The swarthy and brilliant Rafael Angelelli heard the word, andstraightway, beyond all doubting, confirmed it.  With the unheededeasy evening breeze tumbling his uncovered oily locks, he ran to thenearest booth-telephone, and hurriedly called Rose upon the wire.\"Eet ees comin\\'!\" he whispered excitedly into the transmitter.Rose\\'s voice replied with stolid assurance.\"What\\'s comin\\'?\" she asked.\"_Poliziotti_--cops,\" replied the Italian, finding more and moredifficulty with his English as his panic increased.  \"Eet ees Angeltalkin\\'.--I jus\\' getta da _nuova_.--They maka da pinch!\"\"Quit your kiddin\\'.\"\"Naw.  _Veraménte.  Crêdi tu!_  Queeck!\"His fright hit the mark.\"How\\'d it happen?\" demanded Rose.  \"Who\\'s back of it?\"\"Dees Meest\\' Dyker.\"\"You fool Dago\"--her voice grew shrill with fear and anger--\"can\\'tyou do nothin\\'?\"\"Naw.  \\'E\\'s been to O\\'Malley.\"\"You\\'re a hell of a help!  How about Riley an\\' the rest?\"\"Naw.  O\\'Malley maka them do thees.\"\"It\\'s that slut Violet, that\\'s who it is!  That\\'s gratitude for you.I\\'ve been half expectin\\' trouble since she got loose last night.--Howlong have I?\"\"I don\\' know.  Maybe five min\\'; maybe one.\"\"My Gawd!\"\"Don\\' hang up!  Leesten: firs\\' t\\'eeng you do getta da new girl out.Eef they getta dees new girl you go----\"But there came a quick click from the other end of the wire.  Rosehad ended the conversation.Angel, still hatless, hurried through the few intervening streets anddarted into that street to which he had just been speaking.Already the early New York twilight had descended, and the blockseemed, at first glance, to have turned to slumber.  One distant,spluttering arc-light succeeded only in accentuating the gloom.  Fromthe patch of darkening sky into which the roofs blended, a barehandful of pale stars twinkled weakly, and on both sides, from cornerto corner, the uniform, narrow houses rose in somber repetition, eachwith its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each with its shutteredwindows, each silent behind its mask.All this the Italian saw with accustomed eyes, and then he dartedinto the shadow of an areaway, because he saw also that, brief as hadbeen his journey, Riley had arrived before him.In a little knot of wise children, a patrol wagon, its sophisticatedhorses unconcernedly dozing, stood before Rose\\'s house.  An officerwas in the doorway; hurried lights shifted from behind one bowedshutter to another, and gradually Angel became conscious that, allalong the street, frightened faces were peeping from stealthilylifted blinds.For quite some time the watcher waited.  At last the big figure ofRiley and a companion appeared in the open doorway and spoke tosomeone in the wagon.  Through the evening quiet their voices camedistinctly.\"Ready?\" asked Riley.\"All ready,\" came the answer.\"We\\'ve got the madam an\\' the nigger, an\\' the four of thim, but Ibelave they must have turned the new girl loose before we got here.\"This time the reply came from within the house, and it came in thetones of Rose, raised high in anger and in blasphemy:\"You\\'re a dirty liar, Larry Riley!  There never was another one, an\\'you know that as well as I do!  Just you wait till I tell the judgewhat you do know, you damned, low, double-crossin\\' sneak!  Youbastard, you!\"Riley and his companions turned and ran into the vestibule.\"Just you wait,\" the cry continued.  \"Just you wait, you thief,you----\"The voice stopped as suddenly as it had started.There was another pause, a longer one, and then Angel, bending as faras he dared from his hidden corner, saw the two officers come quicklyout with their hands upon the arms of two cloaked women, whom theyhelped into the dark recesses of the patrol-wagon.  They went backand returned with one more.  A fourth followed; then a fifth, and asixth.  Two policemen appeared, evidently from positions that theyhad been guarding in the rear of the house.  The man on the stepsclosed the door and locked it.  All the policemen climbed to thewagon.  The driver gathered up the reins.  The tittering childrenscattered wildly.  The horses woke up and started away at a brisktrot.Impartial Justice was beginning her task.XVISANCTUARYTo leave the protection of Dyker and the kindly secrecy of the cab,and then to leap into a tide of alien human beings and swim againstthem in a strange and terrifying sea, had required the last grain ofcourage and strength that was left in Violet\\'s sapped body and cowedsoul.  It was only by the momentum that Wesley\\'s calm directions hadgiven her, and quite without consciousness upon her own part that,with her cloak gripped tightly about her, she tottered forward,buffeted and shrinking, to the first corner, wheeled to the rightinto a street comfortingly darker, turned again into a still narrowerand quieter way, and then came to an uncertain stop before whatseemed to be no street at all, but only a small black rift among thebeetling walls of brick.Empty as was the way compared with Rivington Street, it was what, hadshe not seen the former thoroughfare, she would have consideredoppressively full.  Urchins walked hand in hand along the gutters,push-cart men cried their wares over the cobbles and, in the hotnight, frowzy women crowded the house-steps.  A clatter of voices, offoreign tongues and unfamiliar forms of English, rattled out thegossip of the neighborhood, and a few steps away, a belatedhurdy-gurdy shook forth a popular tune.Violet cowered against the nearest wall.  She was uncertain as to howto proceed, and she was afraid to stand still.  There seized her anunreasoned terror lest all this seeming escape might be some newtrick leading into some new trap.  A policeman passed with heavytread, but, unmindful of Dyker\\'s assurance, the girl drew, trembling,as far away from him as she could.  Then, when her straining eyes sawhim turn at the next corner to retrace his steps, she made sure thathe was coming back to recapture her, and, now desperate, she faced apair of solemn children slowly approaching from the oppositedirection.The six-year-old boy to whom she especially addressed herself shookan uncomprehending head, but his wiser companion, a very dirty littlegirl of seven, made proud answer.\"He don\\'t to speak no English,\" she said.  \"He only can tell thingsout of Jewish.  But I tells you.  That there\\'s your street rightbehind you.  Yiss, ma\\'am.  An\\' your house is by the two on that thereside.\"Violet\\'s lips tried to form a word of thanks.  She turned, as thegirl had ordered, into the rift among the brick walls, found that,once it had traveled beyond the depth of the house before which shehad been standing, it opened to a width of a few additional feet, andso, almost creeping through the Stygian passage in which shone onlyone far-away lamp, she felt her way to the second door.It was partially open, and a jet of blue gas in the hallway burnedoverhead.  She could see several doors in the shadows, but all wereclosed.  She heard a dragging step coming down the stairs.  She drewagainst the wall and waited.The step was slow and uncertain.  It seemed to consider well beforeeach movement forward, but it had a character that reassured her.  Itwas the same sort of step with which her father was wont to returnhome after his occasional carouses, and she knew that whoso walked inthat fashion was, so long as one kept out of reach, not greatly to befeared.  She remained hidden until the step drew nearer, until thedark bulk of the drunkard slowly massed itself out of the surroundingdarkness, until it had brushed by her.  Then she spoke.\"Can you tell me,\" she asked, \"if there\\'s a Miss Flanagan lives here?\"The passerby was not in a condition where voices from nowhere seemedremarkable.  He stopped and, evidently not clear as to just whencethis particular voice proceeded, addressed the air immediately beforehim.\"I can so,\" he said.\"Then will you, please?\"\"Will I what?\" responded the passerby, determined that the air shouldbe more specific.\"Will you please _tell_ me?\"\"Tell you what?\"\"Is there a Miss Flanagan lives here?\"\"There is that.  There\\'s three of her, an\\' wan of thim\\'s a Missus.Good-night.\"Awkwardly he touched his hat to the air and stumbled out into thealley.Violet breathed hard.  She had never in her life before been in atenement-house; but she knew that now she must seek a door throughwhich some ray of light gave hint of waking persons within and,knocking, of them inquire anew.  Around her, all the doors wereforbidding, so, timidly and with a hand tight upon the shaking rail,she softly climbed the decrepit stairs.At the second floor a shaft of yellow light stopped her.Here was a door that was open, and beyond it, by an uncovered dealtable on which stood a rude kerosene lamp, sat two figures: thefigure of an old woman, her gnarled hands clasped loosely in heraproned lap, her dim eyes gazing at the sightless window, and thefigure of a young woman, her hands beneath her round chin, her wideeyes on a naked baby quietly sleeping in a clothes-basket at herknee.  The floor was uncarpeted, the walls unadorned, the room almostbare of furniture; but on the face of her that looked into the pastand in the face of her that looked into the future there was peace.A quick stroke of pain stabbed the onlooker\\'s heart, but she draggedherself ahead and, not to disturb the baby, spoke without knocking.The old woman turned, and Violet noticed that the eyes which couldsee so far behind were blind and could see no step forward.  Themother, however, spoke kindly and gave the directions that the girlneeded; but Violet, wanting to say something about the baby inreturn, and, able only to murmur formal thanks, pursued her climbupward.She found at last the door that she was certain must be KatieFlanagan\\'s, but, when she had found it, all power of further motionsuddenly ceased.  Weakness, shame, and fear swept over her like acloud of evil gases from an endangered mine, and she swayed againstthe panel before her.Inside, Katie and the shirtwaist-maker, just ready for bed, heard thefaint sound without and, opening the door, caught the almost faintingfigure in their arms.  The dark cloak dropped open, disclosing thecrimson kimona beneath, and this, awakening Violet\\'s one dominatingpassion--the terror of detection and consequent recapture--roused thefugitive a little.  She staggered away from the assisting hands,wrapped the cloak tightly around her, and leaned, panting, againstthe wall.\"Miss--Miss Flanagan?\" she gasped.Katie nodded her black head.\"That\\'s me,\" she said.\"I\\'m--I\\'m the--I\\'m Violet.\"The Irish girl comprehended quickly.  With Irish tact she refused,just then, to hear more; with Irish volubility she burst intoexclamations of pity, and with ready Irish sympathy she took Violetin her strong arms.\"Put her on my cot,\" said Carrie, and they led her there.They took away her cloak, for she was now too weak to protest, and,though they did pause in awe before the crimson kimona, they hurriedto make their guest comfortable.  The Lithuanian Jewess movedsilently and swiftly about with that calm competence whichcharacterizes her people, and Katie, fanning the white face andchafing the thin hands, continued to croon condolences.\"There now!\" she at last smiled, as Violet\\'s blue eyes opened.  \"Sureyou\\'re yourself again entirely.  Don\\'t say a word, not one word, an\\'just tell us whatever \\'tis you might be wantin\\'.\"\"Whiskey,\" gasped Violet.The girls looked at each other.\"That\\'s all right,\" said the Jewess, quietly; \"I can spare it\"--andshe handed Katie some small change.The Irish girl flung a shawl over her head, and ran down the stairs.She went into the side door of the nearest saloon, entered a narrowcompartment, passed the money through a hole in a partition, and wasgiven a small flask partly filled.  Within five minutes she hadreturned, and Violet, drinking the contents of the bottle at a singledraught, began to revive.\"Are you hungry, darlin\\'?\" asked Katie.Violet shook her russet head.\"No,\" she answered, \"I couldn\\'t eat, thanks.  I\\'m only just playedout.\"\"Poor dear, you look it.  But you\\'re all right now, an\\' you can restas long as you like.  Don\\'t you bother.  Don\\'t you worry.  Don\\'t yoube afraid.  You got away without any trouble, did you?\"\"Yes,\" said Violet, and because she was still unable to frame herlips to adequate thanks, she gave them as much of the story of herescape as she could give without mention of the name of her rescuer,who had warned her that he must not be publicly known to figure inthe case.\"A man?\" echoed the cynical Katie.  \"An\\' he didn\\'t ask nothin\\' inreturn?\"\"No.\"\"He must be worth knowin\\', that man.\"\"He only wants me to go somewhere an\\' swear to all Rose done to me.\"\"Oh!\"--Katie\\'s tone showed that she could now account for thegentleman\\'s generosity.--\"Well, don\\'t you do it.\"But Violet could not follow her.\"Why not?\" she asked.\"I don\\'t know just why; but don\\'t you do it.\"\"I promised,\" said Violet.\"Och, listen to the poor dear!\" Katie appealed to her fellow-lodger.\"I wonder is it long she thinks he\\'d be keepin\\' his word to her.\"Her own word freshened the ever-abiding terror in the runaway\\'sheart, but Violet said no more about it.\"Would you have much to swear to?\" asked Carrie, seated on the footof the cot.\"What do you mean?\" Violet parried.\"She means, Violet----\" began Katie.The fugitive, in her new surroundings, shrank from the name.\"Don\\'t!  Don\\'t call me that!\" she said.\"Sure an\\' ain\\'t it the name you gave me yourself?\"\"I know, but I don\\'t want to hear it ever again.  Call me Mary; callme Mary----\"And there, face to face with a new danger, Violet came to a stop.Her captivity had taught her much of bestiality, but it had taughther besides only that some unknown, tremendous power hated her; thatshe was debased and must never, at whatever cost of further sufferingto herself, permit her degradation to attach to her family; that shemust escape, but that she must also wholly divorce herself from allthat life had meant her to be.  She had no thought of the future; shehad only a realization of what had been and what was.\"Mary what?\" asked Carrie.\"Mary Morton,\" lied Violet.  Perhaps she had heard the name before;perhaps the easy alliteration brought it first to her mind.  At allevents, she reflected, one name was as good as another, so long as itwas not her own.\"Would you have much to swear to?\" Carrie was continuing.  \"Is it asbad as they say--there?\"Violet looked at the round, serious face before her.\"I don\\'t know what they say,\" she replied; \"but it\\'s worse thananybody can say.  There\\'s a lot of it you can\\'t say, because there\\'sa lot of it there ain\\'t no words ever been made up for.  Just youpray God you won\\'t ever have to find out how bad it is.\"They looked at her and saw on her the marks of which she was not yetaware.Katie bent over and swiftly kissed the fevered forehead under itstumbled russet hair.\"You poor woman,\" she said with unintended implication, \"an\\' how manyyears did you have to stand it?\"\"It wasn\\'t years; it was--it was only weeks.\"\"What?  An\\' they could get a grown woman like you?\"Violet tried to smile.\"How old do you think I am?\" she asked.Katie made what she considered a charitable reply.\"Twenty-five?\"\"I\\'m not seventeen.\"Katie began to busy herself about the room, and Carrie turned herhead.\"Ah, well,\" said Katie, \"you\\'re tired out, an\\' it\\'s \\'most mornin\\'.We must all go to sleep now.\"\"I only put on long dresses in April,\" said Violet.But Katie seemed not to hear her.  She hurried the arrangements forthe night.\"Sleep as long as you like in the morning,\" said Carrie; \"and if youcan wear any of our things, wear \\'em.  We have to get up early, butdon\\'t mind us.\"The latter injunction was unnecessary.  Though Violet had for sometime been excited by her escape, that excitement had already givenplace to utter exhaustion.  The lamp had scarcely been extinguishedbefore, with throbbing head, she passed into a sleep that was almostcoma, and the lamp that was burning when she opened her aching eyeswas the lamp of midmorning.She was alone and afraid to be alone.  Her head seemed splitting.She saw the milk and rolls that Katie had set out for her on theoilcloth-covered table, but her stomach revolted at the thought offood, and her poisoned nerves cried out for alcohol.  She got up andmanaged to pull on some of the clothes belonging to her two hostesses.From her first glance at the mirror, she drew back in bewilderment.During all her imprisonment she had been used, through her gradualchange, to compare her morning appearance with that of her fellowslaves; but now there was fresh in her mind the standard, not ofthose pale and worn, though often fat and hardened, convicts, but ofthe pair of healthy girls that had, the night before, sheltered her;and from that standard her very image in the glass seemed to withdrawin horror.  Lacking rouge, her cheeks, once so pink and firm, werepasty and pendant; her lips hung loose, her blue eyes were dull andblurred; even her hair appeared colorless and brittle.  Little lineshad formed at the corners of her eyes; her skin seemed rough andcracked, and other lines were already faintly showing from hernostrils to the corners of her mouth.She sat down on the cot, sick and shivering.  When she noticed asmall pile of bedding in the corner behind the gas-stove, she shookat the memory of another such pile on another terrible morning, andby the time she had realized that one of her friends must have sleptthere in order to provide an extra couch, she was too wracked bysuffering, physical and mental, to feel, at once, any greatgratitude.  The fever throbbed in her wrists, beat in her heart,hammered in her brain.  She did not dare go to the street for whiskeyor medicine.  At every sound on the stairs she started up in theassurance that her keepers had come to recover her, and when, in theearly afternoon, a loud knocking sounded on the door, she fell, inunresponding silence, before Katie\\'s flaring lithograph of Our Ladyof the Rosary.\"Hello in there!\" called a not overcautious voice.  \"I want to talkto Miss Violet!\"Violet raised her clasped hands to the printed face before her.\"Don\\'t let them take me!\" she whispered in a prayer to that visiblesign of a power she had never before addressed.  \"Don\\'t let them takeme!\"\"Open up, can\\'t you?\" the voice insisted.  \"I know there\\'s somebodyinside, an\\', honest, I\\'m not going to hurt you!\"Violet\\'s hands fell.  The voice, she realized, was at leastunfamiliar.\"Come on,\" it wheedled.  \"I\\'m all right; I\\'m from Mr. Dyker.\"\"What do you want?\" she inquired.\"He said Miss Violet would know,\" came the answer.  \"He said I wouldbe expected--that it\\'d be all right if I just told you I came fromhim.\"Violet had not forgotten Katie\\'s warning, but she was unable whollyto doubt the one man that had befriended her.  She opened the door.The pink-and-white young clerk that entered was much embarrassed, andhis hostess, in her fever, did not ease him.  Nevertheless, aftermany hesitations on his own part, and more repetitions andexplanations made necessary by Violet, he at last convinced her thathe did indeed come from Wesley Dyker, and that there was waitingaround the corner the cab that would convey her to an office whereshe could begin the redemption of her pledge.Almost in a dream, and too ill now much to care what happened to her,she followed the messenger.  Dazedly she greeted Dyker in the cab;confusedly she left that conveyance for an office where she answeredinterminable questions put to her by another young man who, she wastold, was an Assistant District Attorney; vaguely she heard Dykerassure this official, as she affixed a signature to an offered paper,that Wesley would himself guarantee her appearance whenever it wasrequired, and when she was at last wheeled back and had climbed thestairs and, alone, fallen again upon Carrie\\'s cot, the only one ofrecent facts concerning which she was at all certain was that she hadsaid she was a native of Pittsburgh and that her name was Mary Morton.Katie and Carrie, returning together, found her flushed and babblingnonsense.  When they approached her, she did not recognize them, andthen, for an hour, they could get from her only the monotonousrepetition:\"Don\\'t let them get me!  Don\\'t tell them my name!\"It was eight o\\'clock before the patient, quieted by sympathy andstimulated by whiskey, could be taken to the nearest drugstore, andthere, as soon as the experienced druggist set eyes on her, herefused to prescribe.He beckoned Katie to a corner.\"That girl\\'s got to go to a hospital,\" he said; \"and if I was you, Iwouldn\\'t lose much time in getting her there.\"Katie the competent lost none.  After another drink to stiflepossible protest, Violet was taken upon a car to Sixteenth Street,and was then walked quickly westward.  During all the way she did notspeak, and, when she reached the hospital\\'s fortunately emptyreceiving-ward, she was nearly unconscious.A white-capped nurse received the little party, the young doctor, inshirt-sleeves and duck trousers, hovering in the background among theglass shelves agleam with instruments of polished steel.\"What\\'s the trouble?\" asked the nurse.\"It\\'s that that we\\'ve come to find out of you,\" answered Katie.The nurse nodded to the doctor.He came forward and made a quick examination.\"Bring this woman inside and put her on the table,\" he ordered.  \"Andyou girls, stop where you are.\"Her head thrown back, her dry mouth wide, and her russet hairfalling, the unresisting Violet was carried behind a door that shutsmartly after her.Too scared to speak, Katie and her companion stood outside.  Fiveminutes passed.  Then ten.  After a quarter of an hour, the doorreopened.\"What\\'s this patient\\'s name?\" he asked.\"Mary Morton,\" said Carrie.\"Where does she live?\"Katie gave her own address, and the doctor, a pad of printed forms inhand, noted both the answers.That done, he paused and bit his pencil.\"Married?\" he asked quickly.\"Who?\" parried Katie.  \"Me?\"\"No; the patient.\"\"Well, now,\" began Katie, \"I can\\'t see as that\\'s----\"But the calm voice of Carrie interrupted.\"She is married,\" she said.The doctor pursed incredulous lips.\"Where\\'s her husband?\" he demanded.Katie, who had caught the need of the moment, jumped into the breach.\"Where a lot of them are,\" she responded, \"an\\' where as many moremight as well be, for all the use they are to their poor wives.\"\"Where\\'s that?\"\"Faith, it\\'s you, sir, ought to know: you\\'re the man.\"\"Dead?\"\"Run away.\"\"Not much later than yesterday, did he?  Well, I must find hernearest relative or friend.  Are you either?\"Katie\\'s face lengthened.\"Och, doctor,\" she said, \"you don\\'t mean to--but it can\\'t be thatthere\\'s goin\\' to be a baby!\"The young interne grinned.  Then, serious again, he answered:\"No, there is not.  I only wish it was so simple.  Where are herfolks?\"\"She\\'s none in the world, an\\' no money.  The hard truth is, doctor,that it\\'s a charity-patient she\\'ll have to be.\"\"That\\'s all right; but are you her nearest friends?\"\"Yes, doctor.\"\"That\\'ll do, I guess.  She\\'s a nervous wreck--among other things.We\\'ve first of all got to get her round from that condition, and thenI\\'ll have to secure either her own or your permission, as her nearestfriends, to do something more.\"\"More?\" repeated Katie.  \"Ain\\'t it bad enough as it is?  What more doyou mean to do to the poor--girl?\"\"I don\\'t mean to do anything myself, but this is a common enough kindof case around here to make me certain what the resident surgeon willdo: he\\'ll operate.\"XVII\"A NET BY THE WAYSIDE\"Hermann Hoffmann, passing one evening to the little clothes-pressbehind the bar in Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon, and putting on the canvascoat that was his badge of office, heard the voice of the proprietorcalling his name, and turned to see that stout German-Americanbeckoning him to enter the back-room where, a month before, O\\'Malleyhad held with Wesley Dyker that conference which had proved sodisastrous to Rose Légère.He walked through the open door, whistling his Teutonic melody.  Hehad not that fear of his employer which most employees have of theman for whom they work.  Schleger had proved himself lenient andgood-natured, and Hermann, whose cheerful round face and easy smiledid not interfere with the use of a knotted arm and a mighty fist,was quite aware that there was no complaint justly to be made againstthe manner in which he performed his alloted tasks.\"Hoffmann,\" said Schleger, smiling, \"you\\'re all right.\"\"Sure,\" grinned Hermann.\"Yes,\" pursued the proprietor, \"I been thinkin\\' about you that yousure have made good.\"\"I\\'m glad you vas sadisfied, Schleger.\"\"I am satisfied; but I think you need a little more time off now an\\'then.  I haven\\'t got nothin\\' to do this evenin\\'.  I\\'ll take yourplace.\"Hermann\\'s eyes brightened with unaffected pleasure.  It had notalways been pleasant to work in the nights when Katie was all daybusy in the shop.\"Thanks,\" he said.\"Yes,\" nodded Schleger, benignantly; \"it will be like old times forme.  You take a night off.\"\"Shall I start out righd avay?\"\"Certainly.--Of course you understand I\\'ll want you around here theday of the primaries.\"Hermann nodded.\"And Hermann, there\\'s somethin\\' else I\\'ve been meanin\\' to talk to youabout, and kep\\' forgettin\\' till O\\'Malley reminded me of it again thisafternoon.\"Hoffmann, pulling off his white jacket, stopped with arms extended.\"O\\'Malley?\" he said in a strained voice.  \"Vat\\'s dot man got to dovith me?\"\"Well, you know he don\\'t miss no tricks nowheres, an\\' some time backI was tellin\\' him what a good man you was, an\\' he said we ought toget you a little more active for him.  A fellow behind a bar can do awhole lot that way, you know,--an\\' make a good thing of it.\"\"I know,\" replied Hermann, ripping off the coat, \"but I ain\\'t nopolitician.\"\"Nobody said you was, but all the fellows help a little.\"\"Sure; only I don\\'t.\"\"Why not?  We want to do well for the slate this time.  WesleyDyker\\'s on it; you know him; he\\'s all right.\"\"I ain\\'t no politician, Schleger.\"This stolid attitude plainly began to puzzle the proprietor.\"Don\\'t be a fool, Hoffmann,\" he said.  \"The boys all have their eyeon you, an\\' O\\'Malley don\\'t forget any of his friends.\"\"Schleger, I got my own friends, und I make my own friends.  I don\\'tvant nussing I don\\'t earn from nobody.\"\"But that sort of thing won\\'t look right,\" argued Schleger.  \"Yousee, you\\'re registered from here--\"No I ain\\'t, Schleger; I\\'m registered from my own blace.\"\"Well, I didn\\'t know that; you didn\\'t tell me, an\\' so I registeredyou from here.\"Hoffmann\\'s pink cheeks became red.  He folded his coat neatly overhis arm.\"Vatch here, Schleger,\" he began.  \"I ain\\'t no politician.  I don\\'tcare----\"But he bit his lip and mastered himself to silence.The proprietor saw this and appreciated the self-control that itmanifested.  There had been a time when he had felt as Hermann feltnow, and so he was not disposed to use harsh argument.  He came closeto Hoffmann and, still smiling, dropped his voice to a whisper.\"That\\'s all right,\" he said, soothingly.  \"I guess I know how youlook at it.  Don\\'t say that I said so, but we\\'ll let the matter dropif you only lay low a little and keep quiet.  You know the brewery\\'sbackin\\' me in this saloon, an\\' you know, with the brewery pushin\\' meall the time for its money, I couldn\\'t run the place a month if Ididn\\'t keep the side-door open Sundays.  Well, then, how could I keepthe place workin\\' Sundays if it wasn\\'t for O\\'Malley?  Just try not tobe openly again\\' him, that\\'s all.\"Hermann did not commit himself, but his tone had softened when, inreply, he asked:\"Und should I take to-night off?\"\"Certainly you should.  Go along now, an\\' ferget it.\"He went, but as he walked down the avenue, \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\"issued from his lips to the time of a funeral-march.His sole consolation lay in the fact that, in the recent glimpses hehad secured of Katie, that young lady had begun to evince signs ofrelenting from her former attitude of celibacy.  He knew that she hadgradually ceased to descant upon the impossibility of his supportinga wife, and he thought that she was entertaining hopes of a promotionin the shop to a position where her own earnings, added to his, wouldmake a comfortable living-wage for two.What he did not know--and this for the excellent reason that Katiewould not tell it to him--was that, whatever their prospects for thefuture, both Katie and her roommate were still engaged in that battlewith poverty and temptation which had lessened scarcely one whitsince its beginning.  For the former the fortunes of war were lessthan ever favorable, and for the latter the most that was expectedwas the maintenance of her stand in the face of every armed reason tosurrender or retreat.The strike dragged along its wearied length.  Popular sympathy, whichhad aided the shirtwaist-makers in their former rebellion, had lostits interest in the cause, and, as the newspapers said less, theemployers became more demonstrative.  Hired thugs guarded thefactories and beat whatever young women dared, by the simplest words,to plead, in public, with the scab laborers.  When these battlesoccurred the police, knowing well the interests of their masters,arrested the mere girls for assault and battery upon the thugs,forcing them to remain, if detained, on benches with women old inimmorality and crime; and the magistrates before whom these dangerousfemale criminals were hailed, not forgetting which party to the suitcould vote at the coming election, would often send the offenders tothe Reformatory or the Island, where they could no longer interfere,or would impose fines calculated still more to deplete a strike-fundalready pitiably shrunken.  Some of the unionists had already laiddown their arms and returned to the factories; more had gone over toanother enemy and disappeared beneath the dark current of theunderworld.  The rest--and Carrie was among the number--must sooncome face to face with starvation.Katie\\'s difficulties, though as yet less physical, were scarcely lesspoignant.  She found that she was rarely left long in one portion ofthe Lennox shop.  From the chief woman\\'s-hosiery department, she wasshifted, without warning, to the handkerchief counter, and thence,again with no explanation, she was sent to help in the main aisle ata table where there was a special sale of stockings at reduced prices.At first these frequent shiftings appeared to result from no apparentcause.  She was fined as much as the other clerks, but no more thanthey, and she could in no wise account for the changes.  But at lastshe noticed that after a shift for the worse the sacrosanct Mr.Porter would usually happen by and open a conversation, and then sheremembered that, before such a shift, this same side-whiskeredgentleman had generally made overtures, and that those overtures hadnot been well received.  The theory arising from these observationsshe resolved to confirm.  After the next move she made deliberateeyes at the man she detested, and she was next day promoted, with atwenty-five cent increase of pay per week, to the silk-stockingcounter.  From that day she saw her warfare developing into adangerous game of hide-and-seek in which Mr. Porter was \"It,\" andfrom that day dated her increasing tendency to reconsider thedetermination not to marry Hermann Hoffmann.For Violet, meanwhile, the young interne\\'s prophesy had beenfulfilled.  Four days after her admission to the hospital there hadbeen performed upon her that operation which had been made necessaryby her servitude, but to which, had she been consulted, her fearswould never have allowed her to consent.  For three weeks she lay inher narrow bed among other sufferers, and, when at last the fictionof discharging her as \"cured\" had been accomplished, and thefive-cent carfare donated by the hospital to charity-patients hadbeen given, she had been met by Katie and Carrie, and had totteredbetween them to their room.During another week she had now rested there.  Her eyes were stillsunken, dull, dark-rimmed; her cheeks white and transparently thin.The knuckles of her fingers seemed to have grown larger, and herhands were nearly transparent.  But her lips, though bloodless, hadgained a new firmness.  Clearly or deeply she could never think,without help from a stronger and better mind; yet she had made whatuse she might of her long leisure and had resolved, more or lessdefinitely, upon what she would do with her life.\"I went out an\\' walked a block by myself yesterday,\" she confessed toher two friends early on the evening of Hermann\\'s politicaldiscussion with his employer; \"an\\' I didn\\'t get any tired an\\' wasn\\'thardly any scared.  Now I want you to take me for a longer walkto-night an\\' then by to-morrow I\\'ll be all right.\"They protested that she must not spur her convalescence, but she wasdetermined.  It was, she knew, impossible for them much longer tosupport her, and the last of her one ten-dollar bill had long agobeen spent.\"I\\'ll tell you what we might do,\" Carrie at last suggested.  \"There\\'ssome sort of a concert over at the settlement to-night.  We might goto that.  I used to know some of the ladies there, and there\\'s alwaysa chance that they can get you a job.\"While she was speaking Hermann\\'s whistle, more cheerful now than whenhe had left the saloon, sounded on the stairs, and Katie, surprisedand glad, opened the door to his knock.\"Late to your work again,\" she said, with a smile that belied her.\"How\\'ll you ever be holdin\\' that job, anyhow?\"The newcomer\\'s only answer was a courageous and unrebuked kiss.  Heturned to Carrie.\"Vat you sink of such a vay of meetin\\' me?\" he appealed.  \"My bossgives me a nighd off, und I haf seen my girl not fur ten days undden----\"He paused as his unrecognizing eye fell upon Violet.\"Egscuse me,\" he began.  \"I didn\\'t see----\"\"Of course you didn\\'t see it was your old friend Violet that was an\\'Miss Morton that is,\" interrupted Katie, with a quick desire toshield her charge.  \"You\\'re gettin\\' that near-sighted I wonder howyou can tell a whiskey-glass from a beer-stein.\"Hermann hurried forward in rosy embarrassment and saved Violet fromrising.  He took her frail hand in his big paw and poured out atumbling stream of polite lies upon the matter of her health.\"I guess it ain\\'t quite as good as you say,\" replied Violet; \"but itsoon will be.  Have you--I didn\\'t get no news while I was sick.  Haveyou heard anything about--things?\"\"You knew Rose\\'s place was pinched?\"\"Yes, Katie told me that.\"\"Well, dey had some trouble gettin\\' pail fur her.  Everybody vasafraid fur to do it vith O\\'Malley after her.  Still, dey vorked itsomevays und nobody thought but she\\'d jump it und run avay; but shedidn\\'t.  She tried, but O\\'Malley had central office men keepin\\' eyeson her, und she can\\'t leaf town.\"Katie and Carrie were busying themselves in the preparation of thesupper, and the German seated himself beside the invalid.\"Mr. Hoffmann,\" she said, \"I\\'ve been tryin\\' to think of lots ofthings while I\\'ve been sick, an\\' I\\'d like to know how it is thatwomen like Miss Rose are allowed?\"He looked at her, hesitating, but her eyes were frankly curious.\"Dot\\'s von long story,\" he answered in his slow tones, \"un\\' dem ascan tell it best is most all in deir houses or in deir graves, orelse, in de streets.\"\"Then I guess I was lucky to get away.\"\"If you don\\'t mind me sayin\\' it--yes, miss.\"\"But don\\'t the girls get free when the houses are pinched?\"\"No,\" said Hermann, as gently as he could; \"dey don\\'t get free.  Oferto de Night Court a voman has taken five s\\'ousand to a blace she has,und how many sink you didn\\'t go back to de vork again?  Less\\'n vonhundret und fifty.\"\"I don\\'t see how they could,\" said Violet.Hermann could not see how they could do anything else, but he onlyshrugged his broad shoulders.\"They don\\'t last long anyvays,\" he remarked.\"You mean they die soon?\"\"Effery five year all de girls is new: it\\'s as sure as lifeinsurance.\"The girl shuddered, but mastered herself.\"Don\\'t mind that,\" she reassured him.  \"I want to know--honest.Katie and Carrie won\\'t be bothered----\"\"We can\\'t hear a word you\\'re sayin\\', darlin\\',\" laughed Katie.\"An\\', honest,\" Violet concluded.  \"There\\'s some things I think I\\'vegot to learn so\\'s I can see it--see it _all_.\"She appealed, it happened, to an authority.  Hermann supplemented hisMarx with facts and statistics of a later date, especially upon thepoint at issue, and he was only too glad to find in Violet thelistener that he could never discover in Katie.\"You\\'re righd,\" he said; \"und the only pity is dot more people don\\'ttry to more about it learn.  If dey did, maybe ve\\'d all open our eyessome.\"And he proceeded to open Violet\\'s eyes not a little.  He told her ofthe hundreds of thousands of girls that are annually caught in thegreat net; of how five thousand new ones are every year needed tomaintain Chicago\\'s standing supply of twenty-five thousand; of howBoston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco--all the cities andthe towns--are served proportionately, and of how, above all, fromthe crowded East Side of New York, there are dragged each weekhundreds of children and young women no one of whom, if soldoutright, brings as much as a capable horse.\"Some ve bring in,\" he said, \"und some ve send out.  Ve take fromItaly, und ve send to Sous America.  From all ofer the vorld ve take,und to all ofer the vorld ve send.\"\"You don\\'t always blame the girls?\"\"Plame dem?  A girl as lived by us, she did tucking in a undervearfactory.  She has coffee und a roll fur preakfast, tea und a roll furlunch, von biece of bacon und von egg fur supper effery nighd.  Tenhours a day in a bad smelling room, crowded vis ozzer girls, she runsdot machine.  Part de year she has no vork, because always de factorydoes not run, but vhen de years ends, dot machine, makin\\' fourdousand stitches a minute, she has tucked dree miles of undervear undgot paid dree hundred dollars.  Do I plame such a girl if she easycomes to belief a paid veasel as makes lofe to her und says hemarries her und gets her avay from a factory?\"\"All of the girls don\\'t come from such hard jobs though.\"\"So?  Look now!\"He took from an inside pocket a fistful of soiled envelopes andshuffled them until he found one on which he had transcribed somefigures.\"Yesderday afternoon to dis Astor Library I found a report vat vasmade by people sent out by de State of Massachusetts.  It got a kindof census from four dousand vomen in sixty different cities, allofer.  Before dey vent bad, five hundret vas garment-vorkers, undeight hundret vas rope-makers, milliners, laundry people, paper-box,cigar und cigarette makers, candy-box packers, or vorked in textilemills or shoe factories.  All dem, see, vorked in de poor paidtrades, und a hundret und sixteen come from department-stores, unddot\\'s as bad as Katie\\'ll tell you.  Vorse yet de job ofhouse-servant--sixty per cent. vas dot.  Und all de rest--all deozzer sixty-two per cent.--vere girls who hadn\\'t had not jobs, unddey had to live und couldn\\'t no ozzer vay earn a livin\\'!\"\"Then you think,\" asked Violet, \"they wouldn\\'t go wrong if they couldget decent work at decent wages?\"Hermann looked at her quickly.\"Vould you?\" he asked.She shivered and shook her head and Hermann, seeing that the heat ofhis zeal had led him into a personal appeal that all his normallyslow instincts prompted him to avoid, hurried back to the safe groundof generalities.\"Nobody vat knows,\" he said, \"could belief it.  Nobody vat knowscould belief girls\\'d go into such a life, or once dey got into itstay dere, because dey vanted to.  Vell, vat den?  Ve must find outvhy is it dey gets in und vhy dey stay.

If I canhate any man, dey is him.  It makes my red blood to steam und my skinto get all brickly to see dem or sink of dem.  But I know dot dey,too, are results of conditions, und dey sink dot dey are doingkindness to de girls by not letting dem go to chail or starve.

Und de politicians demselves are only vatdot big system as makes us all vork for less as ve earn, und makes usall pay more as ve can--only vat de big system makes dem!\"Violet understood but partially; yet she had seen enough to know thatthe slavery must have its political side, and it was concerning thisthat she now asked.That Hermann made wholly clear.  He told her the story of the growthof political parties, the development of political machines, thenecessary preying of these machines, in every city, first upongambling and then, as that passed, upon prostitution, and of how thismeant both money and votes.As he talked, she learned how this brought into being the\"cadets\"--the followers of the low heelers--who scoured their own andother towns, hanging about the doors of factories, tenements,shops--wherever the life was so hard as to drive those who lived itto despair--themselves impelled by economic conditions, by the choicebetween hard work and small pay on the one hand and base work andbetter pay on the other, and themselves forced into the \"gangs\" ofchildish marauders while at the primary schools, and so trainedupward, step by step, to the \"gang\" of the politician.  She learnedhow, after the last outcry, a popular leader had struck a cadet, inthe presence of the press-agents, and then, when this one blow wastaken as the end of the infamous relation, had quietly joined withhis fellows in strengthening that relation as it never could havebeen strengthened with the attention of the public upon it.  And shelearned how the result had been a whole criminal confederacy, withits capital in the poorer quarters, bound together politically andfinancially, with its officers, its agents, and its regularlyretained lawyers, at once to defend and to attack.Out of his own observation, Hermann told her of the saloons that werein reality the clubs of these procurers.  He sketched the methods ofprocuring false bail-bonds, of influencing magistrates, juries, andeven judges, and of turning upon the few conscientious policemen withsuits charging oppression and false arrest.\"O\\'Malley und dese ozzer mens like him ofer here make sometimes allof sixty dousand a year,\" he declared, \"und de people lofe dembecause dese O\\'Malleys take deir daughters durin\\' twelve mont\\'s undgif dem coal fur four.\"\"An\\' no one person is to blame?\" asked Violet in amazement.\"I vish dere vas, but dere ain\\'t.\"\"So there ain\\'t no way out of it?\"\"Von vay--und only von.  For de single time badness makes poverty,ninety-nine times poverty it makes badness.  Do avay vith poverty.Reorganize de whole of de industrial system; gif effery man und vomana chance to vork; gif effery man und voman effery penny dey earns.So only you do avay vith poverty, so only you do avay vith unhappyund discontented homes und unhappy und discontented people, und soonly you do avay vith badness.\"He was in the midst of his subject when Katie served the scantysupper, and he would have had neither time nor inclination for themere eating had not his sweetheart sternly ordered him to be silent.But, as soon as the meal was over and the few dishes washed, hecontinued his talk to Violet as, with the two girls ahead of her, sheleaned heavily on his arm all the way to Rivington Street.The concert was, it must be confessed, interesting chiefly to thewomen that had promoted it, the young people that took part in it,and the relatives of the performers, who succeeded or failedvicariously.  Stiffly seated in the cleared gymnasium, a littleashamed and wholly ill at ease, the audience, drawn from theneighborhood and from among the friends of the settlement-workers,bore it, however, with commendable fortitude.  They heard an amateurorchestra play \"La Paloma\" out of time; they heard Eva Aaronsohn readan essay on \"A Day in Central Park\"; they heard a promising sopranosolo spoiled by fright, and a promising baritone not yet escaped fromthe loosening leash of boyhood.  Morris Binderwitz delivered ahesitating oration upon Abraham Lincoln, as culled from his formerdebate regarding the great emancipator, and Luigi Malatesta, havingconsulted the same original sources, repeated by rote a ten-minutetribute to the military genius of George Washington.  There was aduet, a piano solo--a simplified version of \"O Du Mein HolderAbendstern.\"  Everything was conscientiously applauded, nearlyeverything was encored and then, amid a scraping of chairs and morestrains from the amateur orchestra, the ordeal came to an end.As the crowd slowly dispersed, Carrie made her way to the side of oneof the women-workers with whom she had some slight acquaintance and,after the formal catechism upon \"how she was doing,\" made her pleafor Violet.  She told, of course, nothing of the girl\\'s story, norwas anything asked.  It was enough that she should say that herfriend was fresh from the hospital, was in need of a position, and,though still weak, was able to do light housework.The woman to whom this appeal was made called Marian Lennox to herside and, with a brief explanation of what the girl had just said,introduced Carrie.\"Didn\\'t you tell me,\" she asked, \"that you\\'d heard to-day of somebodythat needed an extra servant?\"Marian had heard of such an opportunity.  The word had not come atfirst hand, and the housewife was personally unknown to her.  She wassure, however, that the place was entirely estimable, and she at oncegladly gave the address, to which her co-laborer added, upon strengthof Carrie\\'s assurances, a recommendation.Violet was brought over and presented, and when Marian saw the girl\\'swan cheeks and dull eyes, and read there the plain tokens ofsuffering, her own fine face shone with sympathy.She drew Violet aside.\"Have you ever done housework before?\" she asked.\"Only at home, ma\\'am,\" said Violet.\"Well, you\\'ll like it, I\\'m sure.  I can\\'t see why all you girls areso foolish as to go into factories.  Housework is so much morehealthy and safe, and it\\'s just what women are made for.  It pays sowell, too.  Even if you can\\'t cook, you can scrub and clean and helpand get three dollars or more a week for it, and board, too.\"\"I think I\\'ll like it,\" Violet assented, knowing in her heart thatshe would like any work that gave her a living and protection.\"Then be sure to come to see me after you\\'re settled,\" said Marian.She was now wholly immersed in the work of the settlement; but,though she had undertaken no distracting outside investigation, herindoor duties had thus far brought her into touch chiefly withchildren of the neighborhood, and from them, wise beyond their yearsas they were, she had learned only enough to feel that she had notyet come into touch with the great problems that her young heart wasso eager to answer.  In this first chance to give what she conceivedto be practical help, it seemed to her that she was at last gettingnear to the heart of what she sought.How near she had come to the heart of another problem, and how thatproblem was involved in the problem of her own life, she littleguessed as she smiled into Violet\\'s grateful face and, exactinganother promise that the girl should report to her in any difficulty,bade her good-night.XVIIIIN SERVICEThe house to which, next morning, Violet, still weak and still afraidof her enemies, made, with many timid inquiries, her slow way was inWest Ninth Street, near Sixth Avenue.  It was a four-story, grimy,brick house, with rows of prying windows through which no passer\\'seye could pierce, a dilapidated little yard in front of it, and abell-handle that, when pulled, threatened to come off in Violet\\'sfist.The woman that answered this uncertain summons much resembled thebuilding she inhabited.  She was tall, and she had a sharp face justthe color of the house-walls.  The spectacles high on her beaked nosegleamed like the windows and, like the windows, conveyed theimpression that they saw a great deal without permitting any outsiderto look behind them.  Her once formidably austere black dress wasrusty, and her hands were so lean that Violet felt sure they muststretch when one shook them.\"What do you want?\" asked this woman in a voice that cut like ameat-ax.\"Are you Mrs. Turner?\"\"Yes.  What do you want?\"\"I heard you needed a girl.\"\"Where\\'d you hear it?\"\"At the college-settlement in Rivington Street.\"The woman\\'s mouth tightened.\"Don\\'t see how anyone there come to know aught o\\' me,\" she said.\"Got a reference?\"Violet, beginning to tremble lest this chance should slip away fromher, fumbled after the note that had been written for her, andfinally found it and handed it over.Mrs. Turner\\'s gleaming glasses read it twice, plainly suspectingforgery.  Then she calmly placed it in her skirt pocket.\"Where\\'s your home?\" she next demanded.\"In Pittsburgh.\"\"Hum.  How much do you expect?\"\"Sixteen dollars,\" quavered Violet, who had received instructionsfrom Katie.Mrs. Turner shook her head vigorously.\"Won\\'t do,\" she said.  \"Can\\'t pay it.  Twelve\\'s my best, and when Ihave a cook--I\\'m out of one just now--all you have to do for it is toscrub and sweep and clean the house, wash dishes, and wait on table.How long did you stay in your last place?\"Mrs. Turner gave another skeptical \"Hum\" as Violet answered:\"Two years.\"\"Will you take it at twelve dollars, or will you not?\" asked thewoman, sharply.Violet had been told to descend gradually and not to accept a centunder fourteen dollars a month; but she was no haggler.\"I\\'ll take it,\" she said.\"And good pay, too, considerin\\',\" commented Mrs. Turner.  \"I dunno.It someways don\\'t look reg\\'lar.  Got your trunk over to thesettlement?\"Violet explained that she had no trunk; that she had just come fromthe hospital and had as yet had no opportunity to replenish what hadbeen a sadly depleted wardrobe.\"Hum!\" said Mrs. Turner.In the penetrating glare of the impenetrable spectacles she studiedthe white face before her.\"You wait a minute,\" she concluded.  \"Not inside.  Out here on thestoop.\"She came outside herself and closed and locked the door.\"I\\'ll be back soon,\" she said, and Violet dumbly watched her lank,hatless form stride to Sixth Avenue and turn the corner.True to her word, Mrs. Turner was not long gone.\"I guess it\\'s all right,\" she announced, as she reopened the door tothe house.  \"I \\'phoned that woman to the settlement.  She was out,but a friend answered and said the reference is _genuwine_.  Shedescribed you so\\'s I\\'d be sure.  Looks queer of me, p\\'r\\'aps, but aperson can\\'t be too careful in this town.\"The gleaming glasses seeming to search her soul for a reply, Violetsaid that she supposed a great deal of care was necessary.\"Try to get along without it,\" responded Mrs. Turner, \"and you\\'llmighty soon find out.\"That ended preliminaries, and Violet, agreeing to send for her fewbelongings, began work without further formality.She discovered that Mrs. Turner was a New Englander, who conducted aboarding-house in a manner that sensibly stirred the servants\\'sympathies in favor of the patrons.  Just now the season had greatlydecreased these, but the absence of the cook--it was a chronicabsence--left plenty to be done.Violet had to rise with the sun and attend to the kitchen fire.  Shehad to help the mistress in the preparation of every meal, and of theserving of every meal and the washing of all dishes she was left insolitary authority.  She made all the beds, she emptied all theslops, she swept the floors, beat the rugs, cleaned the windows,polished the stove, and scrubbed the steps.  Even in the scant hoursfree of actual work, she must still be within call of the door-belland Mrs. Turner\\'s voice: the service was continuous from dawn untilten o\\'clock at night.It would have been, upon a frailer nature, a terrible tax, but, freshthough she was from the hospital, Violet, her sturdy stock standingher in excellent stead, managed so to stagger through it that herwracked nerves seemed actually to benefit by her physical exhaustion.Her lot had all the horrors of the average disregarded under-servantand yet, when she crept to her stifling attic room at night--a roomventilated by only a dwarfed skylight--she slept soundly and well.The situation was one that could not, however, long continue.  Mrs.Turner was a pious woman and as such knew that there must be what shedescribed as \"somethin\\' sneakin\\'\" about any maid that could bear herill-temper.  Long experience of one servant after another leaving thehouse in anger, had not only innured the good lady to such losses,but had ended by really creating a sort of appetite for the kind ofcondolence that she secured from her neighbors when without servileaid.  It was therefore with almost a desire for the worst that sheendeavored to delve into Violet\\'s past.This course of innuendo, suggestion, and cross-questioning, pursuedby day and night, through work and rest, in strength and weariness,ended one afternoon when another boarder had departed, taking threetowels with him, as is the custom of departing boarders, and when, asa matter of fact, Mrs. Turner secretly felt that she could no longerafford a maid.\"Where,\" she asked, meeting Violet on the stairs, \"is them towels aswas in Mr. Urner\\'s room?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Violet.\"Well, they was there this morning, before lunch--I seen \\'emmyself--and now they hain\\'t.\"Violet recalled that Mr. Urner had been to his room in the meantimeand had then left forever.\"Hum,\" said Mrs. Turner; \"but you see the soap\\'s gone too.\"For some reason ungiven, the landlady plainly thought that the theftof the soap--perhaps because of Mr. Urner\\'s personal habits--wasproof positive that Mr. Urner could not be the thief, and that Violetmust be.  The girl was not in love with her work, but she wasimmensely comforted by the shelter it gave her, and she now throbbedwith terror at the thought of its loss.\"I didn\\'t take it, Mrs. Turner,\" she pleaded, \"honest, I didn\\'t.\"\"I didn\\'t just _say_ you did,\" replied the landlady; \"but you can\\'tblame me if I think things, the way you come here.--Where\\'d you sayyour home was?\"The question was hurled so suddenly, and was accompanied by such anuncommonly strong glare from the penetrating spectacles, thatViolet\\'s slow brain tottered.  For the life of her, she could notthink of the city that she had formerly mentioned.\"Well\"--Mrs. Turner\\'s foot beat sharply on the floor--\"that ain\\'t ahard question, is it?  Where\\'d you say you come from?\"In desperation, the girl named the first city that her lips recalled.\"Philadelphia,\" she murmured, and realized at once that this waswrong and that her tormentor knew it.\"You said Pittsburgh last week, miss,\" clicked Mrs. Turner.  Sheraised a knotty finger.  \"Now I ain\\'t sayin\\' you took that soap noryet them towels--mind you that--but I am sayin\\' you lied.  Me andliars ain\\'t good company: you\\'d better go.\"The tears came to Violet\\'s eyes.  They overflowed and she broke down.In three short sentences she had confessed enough for Mrs. Turner toguess the entire truth, and had cast herself upon the woman\\'s mercy.But Mrs. Alberta Turner\\'s straight bosom was no pillow for theunfortunate.  Rugged as it was, it was no rock of safety.  She drewher black figure to its greatest height; she called upon all herreligious experience for backing, and upon all her study of the Biblefor phraseology, and she launched at the girl a sermon the burden ofwhich was that, as she would have been glad to receive into her carea woman that had erred and had repented, so she was in Christian dutybound to cast forth and utterly repudiate one that had shown herselffar from repentance by seeking employment without first baring herinmost soul.Violet, in a word, was put upon the street.  She was told that shecould have her few possessions when she called for them, but she wasgiven neither the Rivington Street recommendation nor a new one.She had received no leisure to see her friends of the tenement or thesettlement during the days of her service, and she could not bringherself to seek them now that the black bird had again perched uponher forlorn banner.  For half an hour she wandered aimlessly throughthe quieter streets; for another half-hour she endeavored to gatherher courage.  It was three o\\'clock in the afternoon before,desperate, she had inquired of a policeman for the whereabouts of anemployment-agency, had found the grimy place, passed through thegloomy room with lines of toil-worn slatterns seated along its walls,and stated, in hesitant accents, her mission to the fat and frowzywoman in charge at a littered desk in the room beyond.That woman--she had a steady, calculating eye--looked at her victimwith a curious appraisement.\"What experience?\" she asked.\"Very little,\" admitted Violet.\"Well are you----\"  The woman\\'s voice dropped to the tone ofdiscretion.--\"Are you particular?\"\"Why no,\" said Violet sadly, \"I ain\\'t particular, so as it\\'s quiet.\"The mistress smiled sagely.\"We can fix that all right,\" said she.But she said it so knowingly that Violet found herself hurriedlyadding:\"An\\' so long as it\\'s decent.\"That it was well she had supplemented her preceding speech, she atonce perceived by the change that came over the woman\\'s face.\"Oh!\" said the woman in a tone at once uninterested.  \"Well, have youany reference?\"\"No.  You see----\"\"Never mind why.  If we get you a job, some of the girls have plenty,an\\' we can lend you one of theirs.  Go out an\\' sit down an\\' we\\'ll seewhat happens.\"Violet returned to the dark front room and took a shrinking seat in acorner among the other applicants: two lines of pasty-faced,ungainly, and not over-cleanly women.She picked up a tattered paper, dated the preceding day, and tried toread it.  She saw that the primary election had been held and thatWesley Dyker had secured one of the nominations for magistrate; butshe was tired and disgusted and pursued the print no farther,listening, instead, to the babble of gossip that was going on abouther.Had she ever heard that New York was remarkable for having a modelemployment-agency law, she would there have learned how lightly thatlaw is enforced and how much the employment-agencies of Manhattanresemble those of every other large city.  The foul beds in whichthese women slept three at a time, and for the use of which theagencies frequently charged a dollar and a half a night; theexorbitant two and three dollars exacted as a fee for every positionsecured; the encouragement given servants to make frequent changesand increase their fees; and the hard plight of maids dismissed fromservice, whose only friends, being servants themselves, had noshelter to offer--all these things were the ordinary part and parcelof their talk.The women chattered of their old employers and bandied householdsecrets from loose lip to lip.  Family skeletons were hauled forthfor merrymaking, and testimony enough to crowd a divorce-court wasgiven against not a few respectable citizens.All complained of ill-housing and loneliness.  Bad enough at anytime, the advance of the race of flat-dwellers and the decrease ofhouseholders had intensified all the evils that domestic servantshave to endure.  The best servants\\' rooms in the ordinary houseswere, it appeared, unheated; the worst were windowless closets in akitchen or alcoves in a cellar.  None of these workers had been givena room in which they could fittingly receive their friends, and, asmany of them were forbidden to have callers in the kitchen, theylived what social life was possible on afternoons or evenings \"off,\"on the streets, in the parks, or aboard those floating bar-rooms thatare called excursion-boats.  Violet remembered Fritzie; sheremembered the heavy percentage of servants that, according toHermann, ended in slavery--and she began to understand.At five o\\'clock there entered the room a pleasant-faced, stout woman,uncommonly homely, who was obviously a prospective employer.  Shelooked about her in embarrassment, and seemed uncertain where to go.Violet, beside whom the stranger was standing, rose.\"Are you lookin\\' for the office?\" she asked.  \"I\\'ll show you the way.\"The woman seemed to like her thoughtfulness and seemed, after a quickglance, to like her appearance even more.\"I am not particular about the office,\" said the newcomer; \"what Iwant is a servant.  Come outside a minute and talk to me.\"Violet followed her into the street, wondering.As they reached the pavement, the woman smiled: her smile was sopleasant that she almost ceased to be homely.\"I am a practical person,\" she said, \"and as I also loathe and detestthese agencies, I always, if possible, engage a girl so that shewon\\'t have to pay them their commissions.--Can you do generalhousework?\"\"Yes.\"\"You don\\'t look very strong.\"The girl\\'s heart throbbed.  Mrs. Turner had said that dismissal wasthe result not of what had been done but of the thing\\'s concealment.\"That\\'s only because I was ill awhile ago,\" began Violet.  \"I hadbeen in trouble----\"\"But you\\'re quite well now?\" the woman interrupted.\"Quite,\" answered Violet.She did not know how now to proceed; but the stranger, still smiling,soon gave her a chance.\"Any reference?\"\"No, ma\\'am, I haven\\'t no reference.\"\"How does that come?\"\"I was fired from my last place.\"  She took a breath, then a greaterone, and concluded: \"I was fired because the woman I worked for foundout that I had been in trouble.\"The stranger promptly ceased to smile.\"What sort of trouble?\" she inquired.Violet saw that she had made a fatal error, but she did not know howto end it except by proceeding.\"You know,\" she stammered, \"there was a man----\"The stranger raised a plump, gloved hand.\"Don\\'t tell me that,\" she said.  \"I have no right to the details.  Ithink I understand your motive, and it\\'s creditable, I must say.But, my dear, I am by no means a beautiful woman and I have a verysusceptible husband--very.  I\\'m afraid I must be going along.\"And along she went, leaving Violet in a tossing sea of emotion.  Mrs.Turner had lied, which meant the girl must lie; this later employerhad said that the woman who had been enticed was generally supposedanxious to entice others, a theory that also meant that Violet mustlie.  She returned to the agency, convinced that her error had lainonly in a lack of skill at deception.No other customers appeared during the rest of the afternoon, andwhen the agency closed its doors for the night Violet, too alarmed bythe stories she had heard to trust herself to one of its beds, soughtthe nearest policeman--she was losing her fear of policemen atlast--and had him direct her to a cheap but respectable hotel.  Shehad a little money and she paid gladly for a room that was nearlycomfortable; but she could not sleep, and she returned to theemployment-office early in the morning with red eyes and swollencheeks.Until long after noon she sat there, waiting.  She watched everyonethat entered; she looked at first eagerly and at last appealingly atevery possible employer; but somehow the woman in the inner roomnever sent for her.At last Violet herself walked through the rear door.The frowzy person with the calculating eyes looked at her sharply.\"You back?\" she asked.\"I haven\\'t left,\" said Violet.\"Why, I heard you tried to steal a customer yesterday afternoon.\"\"That wasn\\'t no customer; it was a friend of mine.\"\"Oh!  Well, what do you want now?\"\"A job.\"\"I know that.  What else?\"\"I want to give you this: I have six dollars, an\\' I\\'ll give you fivedown if you can get me a decent job in a decent house this afternoon,an\\' then I\\'ll give you two dollars a week out of my first threeweeks\\' pay.\"The frowzy person screwed her lips in a downward curve that wasprobably intended for a smile.\"I\\'ve had that percentage game handed out to me about a thousandtimes before,\" she remarked, \"an\\' I believe in such money when I getit.  Still, I don\\'t mind seein\\' that five.\"Violet produced it, and saw it swiftly vanish down a black cottonstocking.\"All right.  Tell you what I\\'ll do.  Here\\'s a woman down onWashington Square wants a maid to wait on table.  Can you do it?\"\"I can try; but of course I\\'ve never done it before.\"\"I\\'ll rent you a couple of references in the name of BellaNimick--that\\'ll cost you two dollars more, an\\' I guess I\\'ll have totrust you for it--an\\' the cook down there--she deals with us--she\\'llgive you some pointers on the job.  You\\'ll find it a good place.They\\'re old swells, an\\' the name\\'s Chamberlin.\"Violet lost no time in seeking this new address.  She found it to bea large brick house, with white marble steps, facing the leafy squarefrom the north, and looking across the broad green lawn toward achurch that towered into the blue skies by day and by night reachedup toward Heaven with a fiery cross.  The cook, to whom, through theareaway, she made her application, proved to be an ample Swedishwoman, with a heart fashioned in true proportion to her body, and around, placid face that spoke well for her mistress.That mistress, Violet was without delay informed, was an invalid,whose ills, if mostly fanciful, were at least fancied with a forcesufficient to keep her in town and in the house all summer long.  Herhusband--she had remarried after a divorce--passed the warm monthsvisiting more wealthy friends along the rocky Maine coast, and herson ran in to see her between such invitations to Newport andNarragansett as he could secure.  A daughter by the second union, agirl of sixteen, remained to care for her mother, and this child anda professional nurse, whose long service made her almost a member ofthe family, completed the household.Violet was presented to Mrs. Chamberlin, a frail woman with a white,delicate face, lying on a couch in a darkened library, and, herreferences being casually read, was promptly engaged.  She was toreceive eighteen dollars a month for far lighter work than had beenher portion under the sway of Mrs. Turner, and, as Bella Nimick,began at once to see that a better time was before her.Objections there of course were, but these were not of a sort thateither Violet\\'s previous experience or present necessity permittedher to observe.  Brought up in wealth, Mrs. Chamberlin\\'s ideals hadnot been improved by that decline of fortune consequent upon hermarriage.  Neither in a practical nor in an executive sense had shereceived any training, and, though she would have told you thathousehold management was woman\\'s true sphere, she actually knew aslittle of it as she did of the wholesale drug trade.  It had neveroccurred to her that cooking was even distantly related to chemistryand dietetics; scrubbing, dusting, and sweeping to hygiene, ordomestic administration to bookkeeping.  By the same token, the twoservants had to share a dark, narrow room in the basement, had nositting-room save the kitchen and, so far as social life went, wouldhave been, had they depended upon the Chamberlin house, twin Selkirkson a Juan Fernandez.But Violet was happy.  Her health, if it did not improve, at leastdid not noticeably decline.  The work, if it was hard, was at leastpossible of accomplishment.  And within a week she had made herselfso valuable to both her mistress and her mistress\\'s nurse that thesepotentates found continuous need of her.Then the first blow fell.She had just put away the last of the dishes from an early dinner andwas passing the barred front window of the basement when, from thesunset across the square, a shadow descended to the floor within.She looked up, startled.  In the areaway a dapper, dark, flashilydressed young man was standing, and the young man was Angel.Violet darted away from the window, but Angel, reaching through thebars, calmly raised the sash, which, even in the warmest weather, wasdrawn against the noise and dust of the street.  His dark face wasflushed, and though his wet, red lips were smiling, they smiledevilly.\"No treecks,\" he commanded.  \"You come to me.  I wanta talk.\"Violet did not answer.  She huddled into the farthest corner.\"Stan\\' out!\" continued Angel, his lips still curved.  \"You theenka meso dumb?  I am sharpa \\'nough for see you.  You come here, or I go opestairs an\\' reenga da bell.\"Slowly, like the bird advancing to the swaying serpent, she obeyedhim.\"Now,\" he said, when they were face to face, \"you alone?\"She thanked Heaven that they were.  The cook was in the kitchen.\"Poot on you\\' hat an\\' come alonga with me.\"\"I won\\'t!\" said Violet.\"You do eet!\"\"I can\\'t.  The missus won\\'t let me.  It ain\\'t my night off.\"\"Eef you don\\'t, I go ope stairs an\\' tell all abouta you.\"\"I don\\'t care.  I won\\'t go!\"\"Queeck!\"\"No.\"\"Then da woman she fire you, an\\' I get you when you come out alone.\"Violet knew that he meant it.\"Where do you want to take me?\" she asked.  \"I won\\'t let you nevertake me back to Rose\\'s.\"\"No fear,\" laughed Angel, shaking his oily curls.  \"Meess Rosie shewould not stan\\' to have you near.\"\"Then what do you want?\"\"I want you come to District Attorney\\'s, da place you go witha thatfine gentleman Dyker.  You won\\'ta be hurt.  You can peeck out any copon da way to go along, an\\' you weell knowa da place.\"\"Does he want me--that lawyer I talked to there before?\"\"I been to see him an\\' tell him we come.\"\"Then what am I to do when I get there?\"\"Taka back all you say for thata Dyke\\'.  Da\\'s all: no more--only somooch.  I won\\'t bother you no more; thata lawyer won\\'t bother you nomore; Dyker won\\'t bother you no more.  You do that, or losa da job.Wheech?\"Violet put her hand before her eyes.  She knew as well as a wiserwoman what had happened.  Angel had traced her to Katie\\'s, to thehospital, to the settlement, to the employment-agency--he wasdoubtless familiar with such places--to this house.  Rose\\'s latestcaptive had been turned out on the streets before the raid and lostto sight.  The entire white-slavery charge now rested on Violet\\'stestimony, and Angel\\'s purpose was to have her withdraw the affidavitshe had made.  In her present condition, she could not, she thought,be of any further use to him; that purpose served, he would be onlytoo glad to let her again hide herself, and, hidden here, with Dykerelected and engaged by newer cares, she might escape both friends andfoes.  Terror drove out all desire for revenge upon Rose Légère; itdrove out even the power to keep her promise to Dyker.  All that shewanted was her job.\"All right,\" she said.  \"Wait till I go upstairs and get permission.\"\"No treecks,\" cautioned Angel.  \"Eef you try treecks, I go upstair\\'myself.\"She promised, and left him, presenting to Mrs. Chamberlin in thelibrary, a moment later, a face that bore out her story of theillness of a friend.\"Well,\" said the invalid, \"if you go out I shall be certain to needyou; but I suppose there is no help for it.  Don\\'t be gone more thanan hour.\"Violet joined Angel in the area, and went with him, but, though shewas disposed toward silence, she was surprised to find the Italian ina pleasant, even a genial, mood.In his moment of success, he was well-nigh magnanimous.  He bore nota trace of malice, seeming to regard the whole matter as a game inwhich all the moves on both sides had been in accord with the rules.He chattered a variety of gossip about everything and every personsave those who were most intimately concerned in his present action,and only as they neared the office, where a light showed that theyoung assistant had remained in accordance with the word that Angelhad previously brought him, did he touch upon the matter in hand.\"No treecks, now,\" he cautioned.  \"All you gotta do ees tella heemyou were Rosie\\'s frien\\' an\\' she hit you, so you gotta drunk an\\'wanted to maka trouble.\"\"Won\\'t he be cross?\" asked Violet, her agitation returning anew.\"Naw,\" Angel reassured her.  \"He\\'s used to sucha t\\'ings.  Don\\'forgot, an\\' I give you five doll\\'.\"They entered the office that Violet just recalled as having visitedwith Dyker in her fever-dream.  At a desk, covered with neatlyarranged piles of papers sat the young assistant, who, having thenseen her red with illness, and now seeing her still white from itsrecovery, might well suppose that their first meeting was the resultof drunken malice.\"Here she ees,\" smiled Angel, \"like I promise.  She ees a gooda girlnow, an\\' sorry she tell you da deeferent story an\\' maka trouble.\"Angelelli had told Violet the truth: the young man was indeed used tosuch things--so used to them that he knew protest was fruitless andthat his inquiry must be formal.\"You want to withdraw your deposition?\" he asked.  He was a kindlyyoung man with a thin face.\"Do I what?\" asked Violet.\"He means----\" began Angel.\"I mean,\" interrupted the lawyer, \"do you want to take back the storyyou told me about Rose Légère?  This case is on the calendar forto-morrow, so if you mean to take back what you said, you had betterdo it now.\"\"It won\\'t get me into no trouble?\"The young man raised his eyebrows.\"What would be the use?\" he inquired.  \"No, it won\\'t get you into anytrouble.\"\"Then I\\'ll take it back,\" said Violet.\"You\\'ll have to be sworn, you know.\"\"She don\\' minda that,\" said Angel.  \"Do you, Violet?\"The girl shook her head, and a clerk was called and administered anoath so rapidly that Violet could understand no word of it.\"You\\'re doing this of your own free will--just because you want to?\"resumed the lawyer, donning his professional air, and seeming tobecome infected with the clerk\\'s rapidity of utterance.  \"You are notswayed by any promise of pecuniary reward--that is because you\\'repaid for it?  And there has been no force or threat used to compelyou to do it--I mean you haven\\'t been told you\\'d be hurt if youbacked down?\"Violet bowed in token of a desire to answer these questions inwhatever way was necessary to her bargain, and the new depositionproceeded in the same manner and along the lines that Angel had laiddown.  The clerk hurried because he wanted to get home; the lawyerhurried because he thoroughly disbelieved every word that waswritten; and, severe as Violet had feared that the ordeal would be,it was over far sooner than she had expected.Angel, still loyal to his word, saw her safely home.\"Now,\" he said, as he left her at the areaway, \"nobody weell ever anymore bother you.  Good-night.\"He raised his hat and went away, but, as he turned, he pressed intoher cold hand a crisp, new bill.Violet\\'s fingers closed about it silently.  She had earned it.XIX\"FIAT JUSTITIA RUAT CAELUM\"The trial of Rose Légère was precisely the farce that Violet hadexpected and that Angel had planned.  In ninety of such cases out ofevery hundred, the chief witnesses for the state are suppressed byfear or force, and the prosecution collapses.  Thus, in the presentinstance, had not the newspapers made first-page announcements of theLégère woman\\'s arrest and so attracted to the case the momentaryattention of an effervescing moral public, the District Attorney\\'soffice would, in fact, have contented itself with submitting theindictment and asking for a verdict of not guilty.With Violet in the hospital during the session of the Grand Jury,Wesley, now a man of power, had been able to refresh Larry Riley\\'smemory to such a point that, in the hands of the prosecutor, thepoliceman\\'s evidence was sufficient to insure the finding of a truebill; but when the case was called for trial the situation was vastlychanged.  The girl that had followed Violet into the net had beencast back into the sea of the city and utterly swallowed up.  Violetherself had recanted.  The elder inmates of the Légère establishmentregarded the law as their natural enemy and, had they been disposedto assist it, could in no wise have been regarded as crediblewitnesses.  The action had, therefore, to rest entirely upon Riley\\'stestimony, and for Riley\\'s testimony there was virtually nocorroboration procurable.\"You\\'re a good thing--I don\\'t think,\" remarked the weary-faced youngAssistant District Attorney as, on the morning of the trial, he metDyker in the corridor of the court.  \"We shoved this case about fiveyears ahead on the calendar to please you, and the night before it\\'scalled your witness comes to my office and eats her deposition.\"Wesley had already heard that piece of news.  When, in order to keepan eye upon Violet, he had, some time previously, sought her atKatie\\'s tenement, and had received a series of uncredited vows to theeffect that the Irish girl had no idea of the whereabouts of her latecharge, he had begun to look for a recantation.  It was the sort ofgame that he had himself frequently played, and he blamed his ownlack of foresight in not better providing against it.  Then otherinterests had arisen.  The campaign came on apace; there were newerenemies than Rose to be dealt with, and, when the wires leading fromthe District Attorney\\'s office had informed him that the expected hadoccurred, he received the word with calm philosophy.\"Well,\" he carelessly laughed in reply to the young assistant\\'ssally, \"that\\'s always the way: we elect you people into your jobs andthen you think that we ought to get up your cases for you and holdyour witnesses.\"He went on his way, unconcerned.  Scarcely less concerned, the youngassistant, knowing that his cause was lost, proceeded into court witha solemn air calculated to convince an outraged public morality ofhis high intent; challenged juror after juror with a frowning brow;outlined his case with biting logic; examined Riley, as the officeron the beat, together with the other policemen that had made thearrest, in an heroic style eminently pleasing to the reporters;finally worked himself into a profuse perspiration of Ciceronianinvective against the prisoner and, mopping his weary face, sat down.Equally without concern, and knowing his cause was won, counsel forthe defense, a suave little personage, played his rôle as the cuescame to him: retained his suavity through an opening statement flatlydenying that of his learned young friend; pretended to drop a littleof the suavity through a series of cutting cross-examinations thatleft nothing of the policeman\\'s vague testimony; and gave anexcellent imitation of throwing away all the rest of the suavitywhen, in an impassioned speech, quite up to that of his learned youngfriend, he declared that he would call no witness (which he did notdare to do), because the Commonwealth had wholly failed to make outits case (which was quite true), and because a respectable lady, thedaughter of a mother, had been outraged by ruffianly officers, herhumble home ruthlessly wrecked, and her livelihood endangered (whichwas absolutely false).So, at last, without any pretense at concern whatever, thebottle-nosed personage on the bench ceased drawing pigs on hisblotter, and, sharing the common knowledge of the fate of the case,gravely instructed the unwashed jury that if they thought two and twowere four they should so find, whereas if, on the other hand, theybelieved four to be the sum of one and one plus one and one they wereto perform their sworn duty and so report.  And the unwashed jury,without leaving the court-room, declared Rose Légère an innocentwoman.The innocent woman, still the pleasantly stout lady of the breweryadvertisement, shook gratefully the soft paw of her forensic defender.\"Thank God that\\'s over,\" said she, with quite as much feeling andquite as much reason as many others of us return praise to Heaven forbenefits that originate a good deal nearer earth.The suave defender smiled.\"Yes,\" he said, \"thank God--and pay _me_.\"\"You\\'ll get a check in the morning,\" Rose replied, \"an\\' I haven\\'t agrudge against nobody, though I do think that other lawyer might \\'a\\'got less gay with his tongue.\"\"He was only doing his duty, Mrs. Légère.  It\\'s the law, you know.\"\"What if it is?  I didn\\'t make it.  What I don\\'t like to see is theway you people\\'ll go back on your friends because somethin\\' orother\\'s the law.\"She gathered her silk skirts free of contamination by the low crowdin the court-room, and made her way to a waiting taxicab outside.\"I think,\" she said, as that vehicle began to pump through thestreets, \"I\\'ll pay a little call on Mr. Wesley Dyker.\"She found him, somewhat surprised beneath his drooping lids, at hisoffice, and he immediately agreed to see her alone.\"Now then,\" she said pleasantly, seating herself unasked before hisdesk and leaning easily back in her chair, \"what I want to know is:Am I goin\\' to be let alone?\"Dyker stroked his crisp mustache.  He wanted to gain time.\"You were acquitted, then?\" he asked.\"Looks like it, don\\'t it?  See here, Wes, I know where all my troublecome from, an\\' I can pretty well guess how it come; but I\\'m willin\\'to ferget it if you are.  Are you?\"Dyker\\'s slow eyes were raised to hers, then lowered.\"Yes,\" he said.\"All right.  Now you\\'ll need me an\\' I\\'ll lend a hand, but I\\'ve got toknow first off if I\\'m not goin\\' to be interfered with.\"\"You had better see O\\'Malley about that.\"\"No, I hadn\\'t.  You went to see him first; go to him again.\"\"I----\"  Dyker twirled a pencil between his white fingers.  \"I shan\\'tbe sorry if I do?\"\"You will not.\"\"I may count on that, may I?\"Rose squared herself in her chair.\"Got a talkin\\'-machine around here?\" she inquired.\"Why, no.\"\"Because I\\'d like to have some soft music while I tell you the storyof my life--see?\"\"I don\\'t believe you have to tell that.\"\"Yes, I do.  I want you to know just what I am; then you\\'ll seewhether you can depend on me.  I was brought up decent--that\\'s thetruth.  I had my church an\\' Sunday-school like you had, an\\' perhapsmore.  The other sort of school I had to quit early, because my oldman wasn\\'t paid enough to keep me on, an\\' I had to go to work myself.I was under the age; but I swore I wasn\\'t, so that was all right, an\\'after I\\'d tramped over the whole town, I got a job filin\\' letters an\\'addressin\\' circulars in a young broker\\'s office.  I was mightylittle, but I was mighty good lookin\\'.  I thought he took me for whatI could do, but I found out he took me for my looks.\"She spoke quite without emotion, and Dyker, in spite of himself, wasinterested.\"It cost that broker a lot to live,\" she continued; \"so much that hecouldn\\'t afford to get married.  When he\\'d got through with me, aftera few years, an\\' the baby was dead in the hospital, my people were sodamned respectable that I didn\\'t dare go home to them.  Wall Streethad been plungin\\'; nobody\\'d buy stocks; I couldn\\'t get a job there.Times was hard and I couldn\\'t find a place anywhere else.  It was upto me to starve to death, go into a home an\\' be marked for life, orget real money the best way I could.\"She paused, and Wesley found himself interjecting an urging \"Well?\"\"Well, I got the money.  My broker put me up in a flat.  He stole thecash to do it, an\\' when the fly-cops got next, he blew out hisbrains.  I was still high and dry, so I got a couple of girls to helpme.  Then I met Mike O\\'Malley\\'s brother--the one that\\'s dead now--an\\'he squared things for me so\\'s I could open up the place you knew.  Heowned my joint an\\' was right an\\' regular.  He saw to it I wasn\\'tbothered, an\\' we paid for protection an\\' furnished an address whenhis brother needed one for voters.  I never had no trouble \\'tillO\\'Malley\\'s brother was dead an\\' you queered me with Mike himself.\"\"And is that all?\"\"Yes, that\\'s all.  It\\'s about what you\\'d learn from any other womanin my line of work.  But I\\'ll tell you one thing: I got my girlshowever I could--a lot of \\'em because your friends brought \\'em, an\\'everyone that was brought that way I paid for, fair an\\' square an\\'good an\\' heavy; I had to keep the women down because expenses was sohigh; but no man was ever cheated in my place, an\\' no man was everrobbed with my knowledge.  I may have bad habits of my own, even formy sort of a life; but I always treat my customers on the level, an\\'I always see that my girls treat \\'em on the level, too.\"\"What about the hangers-on?\" asked Wesley.\"You mean about Angel?  Well, I played double because I didn\\'t knowwho was goin\\' to be on top, an\\' in this business you\\'ve always got tobe on the winnin\\' side.  Now you are on top an\\' there can\\'t be noquestion.  I\\'m in this line because I\\'ve got to live; I couldn\\'t donothin\\' else; an\\' I\\'m goin\\' to keep on in it as long as I live.  Yousee now that I\\'ve always been on the level in one way; you see that Ihaven\\'t no reason now not to be on the level in the other way.--Willyou go an\\' fix it with O\\'Malley?\"He did fix it.  He fixed it that afternoon, and he fixed it so firmlythat, within ten days, Rose, with her former minions gathered fromthe corners where she had hidden them, was living and prospering inthe house that Riley had raided.Impartial Justice had been satisfied.XXTHE SANCTITY OF THE HOMEDestiny, busy as she had been with the affairs of Rose Légère, hadnot neglected the usually serene residence of Mrs. Ferdinand WappingChamberlin.  For ten hours the invalid herself had been fretful.This had reacted upon the gentle nature of Mistress Madelaine, whohad in turn made the nurse to suffer, and the nurse, in her ownphrase, had \"taken it out on\" Lena Johnson, the Swedish cook.\"An\\' it\\'s all ban because that son of another husband ban comin\\'home,\" said the naturally good-tempered Lena, in an effort to passalong the general discontent to Violet.\"What of that?\" Violet asked.  \"Is he home so seldom that we\\'ve gotto get the whole house ready for him?\"It appeared from Lena\\'s answer that the young man was home far morefrequently than his mother\\'s finances could well afford.  When hehonored the Chamberlin roof with his presence, he generally managedto secure all the money within reach and to devote that money tosociological researches that kept him out until the lesser hours ofthe morning.  These stubborn pursuits were, it seemed, highlydisapproved of by both his mother and his sister, yet both his motherand his sister hated his father, the divorced husband of theremarried Mrs. Chamberlin; and as the son and brother constantlythreatened that any interference would result in a transfer of hisaffectionate borrowings to the bank-account of his sire, both womenwere, during his intermittent residence with them, torn between theirimprobation of his pursuits and their fear that he would desert thematernal house for the paternal club.\"What\\'s his name?\" asked Violet, as she lent a hand at thepreparation of dinner.\"Philip,\" answered Lena, \"an\\' it ought to be Hungry Haakon.\"And yet, when the prodigal reached the house that evening and,admitting himself with his own latchkey, hurried into the librarywhere his mother and sister, the former on the couch and the latterseated beside it, were awaiting the announcement that dinner wasserved, he would not have appeared, to any stranger that could seehim, a much worse young man than most young men.\"Hello!\" he cried, kissing both women lightly on the cheek.  \"Sistermore of a lure for susceptible hearts than ever!\"\"Much chance _I_ have!\" murmured black-eyed Madelaine, brushing asidea careful blonde curl disordered by his onslaught.\"And the _Mutter_ getting better every day,\" pursued the unabashedyouth.\"Your mother,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, her heavy brows rising almost tothe level of her lace cap, \"will never be herself again, and you wellknow it.\"\"Poof!  A lean horse for a long race, _Mutter_.\"Mrs. Chamberlin waved a thin hand in dismissal of all discussion.\"If you mean to dress for dinner,\" she said, \"you had better begin,Philip.\"\"No use.  I have an engagement for to-night in circles where eveningclothes are rarely considered quite proper, and I washed up at theclub.\"\"Oh, then you stopped there before coming to your home?\"\"It was on my way.\"\"And you of course saw that terrible man?\"This being the term in which Mrs. Chamberlin habitually referred tothe husband that had been so wicked as to permit her, after herelopement with Chamberlin, to institute and win a suit for divorce,her son merely nodded.\"But what\\'s the use of bothering about that?\" he demanded.  \"It wason the way, I tell you.  Cheer up: one may smile and smile and be awoman still.\"But his hearers, by way of response to this advice, sighed audibly.\"I don\\'t think it was very considerate of you, Philip,\" vouchsafedthe younger.  \"You must remember that when you got that last checkfrom mother----\"\"Madelaine!\" cautioned Mrs. Chamberlin.\"I don\\'t care, dear.  Philip, you must remember that when you gotthat last check from mother, it was on your distinct promise that youwould not see your father again for a year.\"\"And don\\'t you remember,\" retorted Philip, \"that I afterwards, uponreflection, distinctly withdrew that distinct promise as utterly andin essence unfilial?  A woman can always remember more things than aman has forgotten, and forget whatever she doesn\\'t want to remember.If it had been an honest woman instead of an honest man that Diogeneswas looking for, he\\'d have had to throw away his lantern and hire aportable lighthouse.\"But he kissed the girl as he said this, and pressed his mother\\'s hand.\"The trouble with you two,\" he declared, \"is that you don\\'t get aboutenough.  Seclusion makes you serious.\"\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, \"that you had brought me back thenews that you had grown more like us.\"\"More serious?  Still harping on your son, dear!  No, I\\'m sorry todisappoint you, but I\\'ve about given up all hope of marrying money,and marrying anything else is an impossibility.  I must be getting onin years.  You know how it is: as we grow older we become moreparticular and less desirable--when we\\'re old enough to have learnedproperly to play the game of love, we\\'re too old to play it.\"\"You\\'re a mere boy,\" observed Madelaine, with a toss of her blondecurls.\"And you talk like one,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, smiling in spite ofherself.\"I\\'d never think of accepting anybody so young as you are,\" the girladded.Philip pulled her pink ear.\"That\\'s right, Queen Mab,\" he agreed; \"wait till a man is large andround and settled.  And when you do marry, marry for keeps: a littlemarriage is a dangerous thing, eh, _Mutter_?\"\"Philip!\"What more she would have said to this criticism of her own estate,Mrs. Chamberlin\\'s son was not just then to hear, for a Japanese gonginterrupted her with the melodious announcement of dinner, and theson snatched his protesting mother in his arms and, with Madelainefollowing, bore her into the brightly lighted dining-room.He looked at the shining silver and gleaming linen and glass andchina, and he saw the pale liquid that filled one of the glasses athis own accustomed place.\"Good!\" he cried.  \"I hope Lena\\'s hand has not forgotten its cunning.Stolen waters are sweet, but the best cocktail is a dry one.\"And then, with his living burden still in his strong arms, he lookedacross the table and into the eyes of the new servant.The new servant, from the shadow, returned that gaze.  She saw beforeher, in the person of her employer\\'s son, Philip Beekman, theblack-haired, gray-eyed young waster that had once promised her helpin the house of Rose Légère.  On her part, Violet could have nodoubt, and it was only with the utmost exercise of self-control thatshe continued her duties.  But for Philip certainty was notimmediately obtainable.  He saw many girls in the surroundings inwhich he had first seen Violet, and her he would probably long sincehave forgotten had it not been for the appeal that she had made tohis surface emotions.  Nevertheless, the walls of his own home didnot, in this case, form a setting that made for easy identification,and, besides, though this woman had recovered some degree of herhealth, the best of her looks would never return.  Beauty is thequality most remembered by such men as Philip Beekman, and beautylost is the best disguise against them.  Philip, therefore, quietlydeposited his mother in her chair, and continued his easy railleryuntil the soup had been served and the little family had been left,for a time, alone.\"New maid?\" he then casually inquired.\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, \"and actually a fairly competent one.\"\"What\\'s her name?\"\"Bella.\"\"Any more?\"\"Really, I don\\'t recall her family name, Philip.  What possibledifference can it make?\"\"I suppose,\" said Madelaine, \"that he thinks her pallor interesting.\"\"Nonsense, Madelaine!\"\"Her last name is Nimick, Philip.\"\"Oh!\" said Philip, inwardly reflecting that, in the nature of things,a name could not much signify.  \"I was merely attracted by the factthat she didn\\'t precisely resemble a servant.  Have you never noticedhow all men look as if they belonged to the class below their own,and all women to the class above?  It seems as if a man could neverrise above his environment, and as if a woman could never descend tohers.\"He did not again refer to the subject, but the subject was, duringall the meal, keenly conscious that his gray eyes were covertlywatching her.  She moved about the room with increasing difficulty.Her hand shook as she brought the salad-bowl, and she spilled some ofhis coffee on the cloth.As soon as Lena had left the kitchen and gone upstairs, Beekman cameinto the pantry.  His manner, neither that which she had once knownnor that which she had more lately observed, was quick andthreatening; his frank face was flushed with anger.\"Your name is Violet,\" he said in a voice that, though low, shookunder the restraint that he put upon it.She was standing beneath a gas-jet, a little column of dishes in herhand.  The cruel light showed the havoc that had been wrought uponher, but it also showed the marks that no years or change could alter.\"Yes,\" she said, her own voice scarce a whisper.\"Did you----\" he bit his lip.  \"Did you come here to scare me?\" hedemanded.She put down the dishes.\"What do you mean, Mr. Beekman?\"\"Because I haven\\'t any money, you know.\"\"Mr. Beekman!\"She put her hand before her face, and he saw that he had been wrong.\"I beg your pardon,\" he sulkily said.  \"In the circumstances, itwasn\\'t an unnatural supposition, though my mother thoroughlyunderstands my manner of life; but I see now that I shouldn\\'t havesaid it.\"He paused, and then, because he hated to be in the wrong, he huntedabout for another excuse for attack, and, finding one, became moreangry than before.\"Only how dared you,\" he asked, \"how did you dare to come into thishouse?\"Violet bowed her russet head.\"I didn\\'t know it was yours,\" she said.\"You didn\\'t know?\"\"How could I?  Lena didn\\'t happen to say nothin\\' about you beforeto-day, an\\' your mother has a different name.\"\"Don\\'t talk of my mother!\" he commanded.Had Violet known all the truth of her mistress, it would probablyhave flashed over even the servant\\'s dull brain that the differencebetween a woman beaten into slavery and a woman that married the manwho, during her first marriage, had been her lover, was a differencenot of kind, but of degree, and of a degree decidedly in the ethicalfavor of the former.  However, she held her tongue.It was the best shield she could have chosen.  Through silence fewfits of anger are strong enough to reach, and the quick temper ofBeekman began slowly to spend itself.\"I don\\'t see how you could come into any decent house,\" he grumbled,\"no matter whether you knew whose it was or not.\"Still Violet did not answer.\"I suppose you didn\\'t think about that, though,\" Philip pursued.Violet was as yet too stunned at all adequately to feel.  With ashaking finger she drew invisible arabesques upon the shelf besideher.\"How did you get away from Rose\\'s, anyhow?\" he asked.Slowly she raised her head.  Slowly she fixed him with her tired blueeyes.  And slowly, still drawing arabesques now unregarded, sheanswered:\"Does that make much difference, Mr. Beekman?\"\"Wasn\\'t I interested?\" he blustered.\"Because, you see,\" she concluded, \"however it was, it wasn\\'t by noneof the help you promised.\"The thrust just pierced his armor of convention.\"Oh, well,\" he said, \"what could I do?  I wanted to help--you knowthat--but what could I do?\"\"Nothin\\'!\"  Her eyes clouded as if they looked at something which,though clear to sight, passed all explaining.  \"Nothin\\', I suppose.\"The words lent him courage.\"And I can\\'t do anything now,\" he went on, his anger cold, but hisdetermination unchanged.  \"I\\'m sorry for you--on my word of honor, Iam sorry for you with my whole heart, Violet--but you can\\'t stayhere--you must see that you can\\'t stay in this house another night.\"Her eyes were still on his.\"I know you think that,\" she replied, as if puzzled and seeking asolution.  \"An\\' I know what you think goes.--But, myself, I can\\'t seewhy not.\"\"But, Violet, just consider!\" he cried, his hands outstretched.\"You wanted me to get away an\\' get a decent job,\" she dully answered.\"Not here.\"\"What\\'s the difference?  What\\'s the difference whether it\\'s here orsomewheres else?  I can\\'t see.\"\"But here all the time I should know.\"\"Don\\'t you know, wherever you are, about lots of others that don\\'tget away?  An\\' does that hurt you?  Wouldn\\'t you know about mewherever you are, about me wherever I went?  An\\' would that hurt me?\"\"You don\\'t understand!\"He seemed to charge her with her admitted incomprehension as if itwere a crime.\"No, I don\\'t,\" she repeated.\"Can\\'t you see that if you were somewhere else, it would bedifferent?\"\"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t.\"\"Not if you were where nobody knew about you?\"\"No, I don\\'t see that, Mr. Beekman.  I haven\\'t got any disease togive people.\"\"I wasn\\'t thinking that.\"\"Well, you wouldn\\'t tell on me to the people I went to if I wentsomewheres else?\"\"Certainly I wouldn\\'t.\"\"An\\' you don\\'t think I\\'d steal, do you?\"\"Of course not.\"\"Nor--nor get anybody who was kind to me into the sort of a hell Iworked so hard to get myself out of?\"\"How could I think it?  What are you driving at, Violet?\"\"This: that if all them things is the way you say, I\\'m fit for anyjob I\\'m able to do--an\\' I\\'m able to do this one.\"\"Not in this house.\"\"What\\'s the difference where?\"  Her voice was still low, and herwords still came slowly; but she was, however imperfectly andpainfully, beginning to think--which is a very dangerous thing in anyexploited individual.  \"What\\'s the difference where?\" she asked.\"What you know don\\'t make me no worse, an\\' what I know don\\'t make meno better.  The truth\\'s the truth.  What\\'s happened\\'s happened.  Iused to be a girl in Rose\\'s house, no matter if I was now workin\\' inyour house an\\' you do know what I used to be.  Wherever I am, I\\'mwhat I am; your knowin\\' it don\\'t help or hinder; an\\' if I\\'m fit fornext door I\\'m fit for here.\"Philip Beekman passed his long fingers through his black hair.  Itwas the gesture she had seen him employ on that remembered night atRose\\'s, but now it had a new significance.  The young man was as muchthe creature of his surroundings as Violet was the creation of hers.He could no more appreciate her point of view than she couldcomprehend his.  It was as if they spoke different tongues.  Beekmanwas powerless to argue further, and when a man reaches thatcondition, he takes a firm stand upon authority.\"All right,\" he said; \"we won\\'t waste words.  The hard fact is thatyou\\'ve got to go.  I\\'m sorry, but you\\'ve got to go and go now.\"She bowed her head; she had finished.He wished she would answer; he wished she would fly into a rage; butas she remained dumb, he continued:\"I suppose your hat and jacket are in the kitchen.  You can drop me acard telling me where to send your trunk.  I\\'ll explain this toyour--to my mother somehow.  I\\'ll do whatever I can for you--outside.\"A slow shake of her russet head was her reply.\"I\\'ll give you a recommendation.\"\"I won\\'t need none, Mr. Beekman.\"\"I--I think I\\'ve got fifty dollars somewhere in my clothes.\"\"I was paid my wages only this mornin\\'.\"He looked at her in gray-eyed amazement.\"But I say,\" he began, \"you aren\\'t going to--you don\\'t mean youwon\\'t----\"She did not answer.  She moved slowly and quietly away.  She went tothe kitchen, got her shabby beaver hat and her long coat.Philip, in the pantry, remained as she had left him, erect, eyes andmouth wide.A moment later he heard the area door open and close.XXIAN ANCIENT PROBLEM\"An twent\\' from Rosie Légère\\'s,\" said Angel, \"maka two hundre\\'.\"Hermann Hoffmann, alone behind the bar in Schleger\\'s saloon, and halfasleep as he bent over a thumbed and stained copy of the lastevening\\'s paper, scarcely raised his head.  It was half-past oneo\\'clock in the morning.  Except for Angelelli and the man to whom hewas talking at a table by the door, the place was empty of customers,and so unconcerned were these two late-comers that, had he wished it,every word of their conversation could have been taken down by thebar-keeper.But the bar-keeper did not wish it.  He knew both the men, and hadheard something of the character of each, as every good bar-keepercomes to know and to hear about most of the regular patrons of theestablishment that employs him.  With Angel he had even had a noddingacquaintance in the days of the brewery-wagon, and since he haddonned the white jacket he had seen often the narrow-chested,stoop-shouldered, slouching Austrian now in conference with thedapper Rafael.  He had been told that this Austrian, with hisbristling brown hair, pale face, and thin mouth, pulled downward atone corner by an ugly scar, made his regular living by appropriatingthe wages of a girl that he nightly drove forth to scour the darkstreets, earning what money she could from what looks were left herand stealing what she could not earn.  And Hermann knew that, now anelection was near, both of these proud possessors of the suffragewere doing their exacted duty for the powers that permitted them tothrive, and were, like the army of others in their own profession,through all New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, through thetenderloin of every American city, providing for the voting ofrepeaters, of dead men, of men that never were, in the interests ofwhichever of the two great political parties happens to be in controlof the city where such votes are needed.\"Mirka,\" said Angel, laying down his gold-rimmed fountain-pen andlooking up from the back of the envelope on which he had been makinghis calculations, \"we weell need a hundre\\' more.\"Mirka, the Austrian, tried to smile, but that ugly scar at the cornerof his mouth caught the smile in the making and pulled it down into asinister sneer.\"I can smoke out fifty if you can,\" he said.\"Da sama kind?\"\"Yes.\"Hermann, behind the bar, frankly yawned.  He remembered, with a slowsmile, how, when he had first come across such practices, years ago,he had gone to the ward-leader of that party in whose interests thework was being done.  He remembered how this potentate had firstassured him that he had \"heard wrong,\" and finally met hispersistence with a warning that he had better keep his mouth shut.He remembered how, at the rival headquarters, he had been told thatthere was always a mass of such evidence, none of which could beeffectively used before election, and how, when he had ventured tosuggest that an election-offense was punishable after election-day,he had been ridiculed.  And lastly, he knew that his own Socialistfriends had already all the information that he had now obtained, butcould do no more at the polls than lodge protests that would beoverruled by the election-judges and subsequently pigeon-holed by thecourts.\"All right,\" Angel was saying, as he pocketed his pen and tore theenvelope into small bits, which he tossed deftly across the room intothe gutter beneath the bar.  \"I feexa heem.  I geta da rest.\"The two men rose and stepped to the bar for a nightcap of whiskey.Already the Austrian had drunk more than was good for his temper, butHermann, whose eye was usually exact in discerning such matters, wassleepy to-night, and did not notice this.  Angel poured a bountifulportion from the cool metal-stoppered bottle that Hoffmann shovedclanking toward him.  Mirka decanted even more, and then momentarilyreleased his hold of the bottle to speak to his companion.  Hermann,thinking both men satisfied, reached for the liquor.\"Keep your dirty fingers off of that!\" cried Mirka, with no trace ofhis nationality in his speech.  \"Can\\'t you wait till I pour a realman\\'s drink?\"Hermann flushed.\"It\\'s a bath, den, you\\'re goin\\' to dake?\" he asked.\"I will if I like, you damned fool!\" rejoined Mirka, his eyes warming.Hermann\\'s blue glance surveyed the uncouth, slouching figure.\"All righd,\" he said; \"you need von.\"The Austrian glowered.  Then, tilting back his bristling head, hetossed the liquor down his long throat.\"Give me another, you Dutchie,\" he ordered, pushing his glass acrossthe bar.Angel began a quieting word, but Mirka broke in, still addressingHermann.\"Get a move on, or I\\'ll break yer face, Dutchie!\" he insisted.Hermann\\'s jaw was suddenly set in a rigid line.  He remainedmotionless.\"Come on, now!\" said Mirka.\"Don\\' maka these treecks,\" protested Angelelli, dividing his pleabetween his hearers, and placing his hand upon the Austrian\\'sshoulder.\"You shut up!\" retorted Mirka, shaking himself free.  \"And you, youDutch fool, give me a drink--quick!\"Hermann did not obey.  He saw at last the fellow\\'s condition.\"You\\'ve had enough,\" he said.\"Mind yer own business,\" snapped the Austrian.\"Dot\\'s what I\\'m doing,\" answered Hermann, calmly reaching for theempty glasses.  \"You\\'re drunk.\"He had hardly spoken before Mirka, his habitual lassitude droppingfrom him like a discarded cloak, made a quick leap that brought himhalf across the bar.  The glasses crashed, the bottle was overturned,and in the Austrian\\'s waving, clenched right hand there flashed aknife.It was a moment of action, but a moment only.  From one side of thebar, Angel had gripped Mirka by the waist and was pulling himbackward; on the other, the powerful German had caught thethreatening fist and now, with a quick twist, sent the knife plunginginto the tub below the beer-spigots.Spluttering obscenities, the Austrian was dragged to the positionfrom which he had made his attack.\"You keepa quiet!\" commanded Angel of the one combatant, and to theother: \"You getta more fresh with your mouth an\\' I getta you fired.\"Hermann had recovered the knife and was now calmly drying it upon abar-towel.  Such incidents were not unusual in his occupation and,now that this one was closed, he could afford to smile his answer toRafael.Mirka, on the other hand, though still tightly embraced by Angel, wastrembling with rage.\"I\\'ll get you for this, Dutchie!\" he declared.\"So?\" said Hermann.  He still smiled, but he was tired of beingcalled Dutchie, and his tongue ran just a hair\\'s breadth ahead of hiscaution.  \"Try it,\" he concluded; \"try it, you dirty Austrian loafer,und I\\'ll somevheres go vhere dose names you\\'ve been makin\\' oud villget you vhat you deserve.\"\"Whata you say?\" Angel kept his hold upon his friend, but thereference to their recent occupation brought a glint of anger intohis own eyes.By way of beginning his reply, Hermann smilingly returned the knifeto its owner, who seized it with a growl of malice.\"Neffer mind vhat I say den,\" he answered.  \"Vhat I say now is\\'Goot-nighd.\\'  You two get oud.\"He raised his thick arm to point to the door, but in the manner ofits raising there was another significance.  For a moment Angel andMirka met hotly his steady gaze.  Then the bar-keeper raisedcarelessly his other hand: it held a stout bung-starter.The two men, with a common impulse, turned and silently left theplace.Hermann was not afraid of them.  He knew that his threat of betrayalhad been idle, for the excellent reason that there was no quarter inwhich betrayal would be effective, and he told himself that, as soonas their anger and their drunkenness had in some measure subsided,the plotters would recognize this.  So he whistled complacently as hepolished the bright surface of the bar and did not hesitate, when hebegan at last to wash and put away the glasses, to turn his back tothe swinging door of the saloon.  The campaign was not one that wasconsidered important and, personally, he cared but little about it orwhat enmities it might awaken.The campaigners cared, however, a great deal.  There was in no sanemind any question of the result, but so mighty is custom that therewere few sane minds that did not publicly pretend to be in doubt uponthe issue.For many days previously, any outsider, reading the newspapers orattending the mass-meetings in Cooper Union and Carnegie Hall, wouldhave supposed that a prodigious battle was waging and that the resultwould be, until the last shot, in doubt.  There were terriblescareheads, brutal cartoons, and extra editions.  As the real problemwas whether one organization of needy men should remain in control,or whether another should replace it, there were few matters ofpolicy to be discussed; and so the speechmaking and the printingresolved themselves into personal investigations, and attacks uponcharacter.  Private defectives were hired, records searched,neighbors questioned, old enemies sought out, and family feudsrevived.  Desks were broken open, letters bought, anonymouscommunications mailed, boyhood indiscretions unearthed, and women andmen hired to wheedle, to commit perjury, to entrap.  Whatever wasdiscovered, forged, stolen, manufactured--whatever truth or falsehoodcould be seized by whatever means--was blazoned in the papers,shrieked by the newsboys, bawled from the cart-tails at the cornersunder the campaign banners, in the light of the torches and beforethe cheering crowds.  It would all be over in a very short while; ina very short while there would pass one another, with pleasantsmiles, in court, at church, and along Broadway, the distinguishedgentlemen that were now, before big audiences, calling one anotheradulterers and thieves; but it is customary for distinguishedgentlemen so to call one another during a manly campaign in thissuccessful democracy of ours, and it seems to be an engrossingoccupation while the chance endures.Though he often trembled, Wesley Dyker, perhaps because his recordsof any sort were as yet but brief, escaped with a fairly clean skinthis Yahoo discharge, but the downpour continued all about him withtremendous vigor and at tremendous cost.  The Republican leaders,fully expecting defeat, assessed their supporters just as heavily asif they were certain to triumph, spent much time and more money andno end of breath.  The Reformers, under varying factional names,bewildered, sometimes advisedly, the independent voter by herejoining one leading party, there endorsing another, and in a thirdplace clamoring for a ballot so split and so subdivided that theaverage man could in no wise comprehend it when marked.  TheSocialists, to be sure, went along calmly enough, confessing theirnumerical weakness and securely seeing in the small increase of thepresent day the promise of the large majority of the distant morrow.But all the while the Democratic organization thundered an inchforward in the light and ran a mile forward in the darkness byprecisely the same powers as were invoked, with so much smallerresults, by the Republicans and the Reformers.Not that there was any reason to doubt the organization\\'s victory.There was none.  But every organization always insists that, nomatter how easy the skirmish, its leaders must so manage that itcomes out of the fray to all appearances stronger than it came out ofthe fray preceding.  Each majority must be larger than the last, andso the lists are padded, and the repeaters imported, and thelodging-houses colonized, and the organization, like the frog in LaFontaine\\'s fable, though with less reason, swells and swells againstthe hour when it shall finally burst.  The saloons were crowded; itwas freely predicted that, the season being prosperous, votes wouldgo at no lower than two dollars, and, in some quarters and someinstances, as high as five dollars apiece.There were some points, however, to which the tide of prosperity hadnot risen, and one of these was the high tenement of Katie Flanagan.The Irish girl returned there every night a little more discouragedthan when she had left its precarious shelter in the morning, asdoubtful as ever of Hermann\\'s ability to support a wife, but moredoubtful than ever of her own ability to help, should they marry, inthe support of the home.  At the shop, the work and the hours weighedmore and more heavily upon her; they dragged at the heels of her mindwhen she endeavored to evade the insulting compliments of the callowyouths and gray men that strolled by her counter, and they wereimpedimenta that made it daily more difficult to escape withoutoffense the oily approaches of the dignified Mr. Porter.\"Sometimes,\" she said one evening, as she and Carrie sat over theirmeager supper, \"I begin wonderin\\' again whether it\\'s worth whilerunnin\\' away.\"The striking shirtwaist-maker, who had spent a long day onpicket-duty before a Waverley Place factory, looked up with roundeyes calmly serious.\"That is what I am wondering all the time,\" she replied.Katie made an impatient movement of her hand.\"Och, now,\" she generously protested, \"it\\'s all right for me togrowl, because I\\'ve got a job.  I don\\'t count, an\\' it\\'s just mehabit.  But you mustn\\'t do it, me dear.\"\"I am not complaining; I am just honestly wondering, that\\'s all.\"\"But if the worst came, you could go back to work, you know.\"Carrie\\'s face was all surprise.\"And turn traitor to my friends striking in my own and all the otherfactories?\" she asked.  \"Oh, no; you would be the last to do ityourself, Katie.  I would rather go on the street.\"\"You don\\'t mean that, darlin\\'.\"\"I do mean it.  If I went on the street, I would hurt myself, but ifI did the other thing I would hurt all the other girls in the union.\"She spoke quietly, but with infinite conviction, and Katie knew theforces that had brought about this state of mind.  The widespreadstrike, though it still continued, was a failure.  Public sentimenthad never been aroused; the employers had succeeded in securingnon-union labor, whose wages they were, even now, securely reducing,and whose privileges--granted to entice them to work--they werecurbing; their political powers earned them the armed assistance ofthe law; and the strikers\\' ranks, though but little thinned bydesertion, were steadily decreased by poverty, by the necessity ofthe girls to find other sorts of work, by illness, and, now that thecold autumn had set in, by death.  Carrie was underfed, scantilyclothed, penniless, and Katie, remembering these things, foundherself without reply.Had she needed further example of the pressure of conditions upon herkind, she could have found it in an incident in the shop on the dayfollowing.  A bull-necked young man, with ruddy cheeks and acertainty of manner that spoke as loudly in his eyes and hisscarf-pin as in his voice, sauntered up to the silk-stocking counter,where she happened then to be stationed, and began turning over thewares displayed.\"Have you been waited on?\" inquired Katie.\"No,\" said the young man, looking at her steadily; \"but I\\'d like youto wait on me.  Are you busy?\"Katie said nothing, but stood there.  The young man said nothing.Katie began to finger the boxes before her, but she felt that theyoung man was looking only at her.\"What quality would you like me to show you?\" she asked.\"Well,\" parried the customer, \"what quality do you like?\"She shot one glance at him: he was still looking at her.\"We have only the best at this counter,\" she answered, with a slightflush.  \"You\\'ll be findin\\' the cheaper the sixth aisle to your right.\"But the young man only laughed with unconcern, and continued to keephis gaze on her lowered Irish blue eyes.\"I can afford the best of everything,\" he said.There was a pause.  Katie raised her eyes and met his own withoutflinching.  He smiled, but he was quite too satisfied with his owncharms to notice that the salesgirl was not smiling.\"What time do you quit work?\" he inquired.\"I never quit.\"She said this as if she were closing a door, but the young manproceeded imperturbably to rattle at the knob.\"I thought,\" he said, \"that you might like to eat a little dinnerover at the \\'York\\' with me this evening.\"\"Thanks,\" the girl answered, \"but I do all me eatin\\' with mehusband.--Will you, please, be tellin\\' me what sort of stockin\\'s youwant?\"The young man grinned.  He seemed to enjoy what he took to be herplayful repartee.\"Look here,\" he replied, \"my wife is away back home, and I\\'m allalone over at that hotel.\"He was leaning airily toward her, both hands on the counter.  Katie,standing opposite, leaned toward him.  She answered his smile, but hecould not see that her smile was not of his own sort.\"Do you want to buy anything?\" she demanded.\"Yes,\" said the customer, meeting her gaze again.  \"Will you sell?\"It was no unusual incident, no more unusual than the coming incidentof Mirka\\'s attack upon Hermann, but the girl had reached the end ofher endurance, and what followed across that counter was not unlikewhat was to occur across Ludwig Schleger\\'s bar.  Katie opened herfirm, pink palm and smacked the young bargain-seeker smartly acrossthe mouth.There was no immediate consequence.  The aisle was too crowded toallow any but the nearest employees to witness the blow, and thecrowd was too intent upon its own thousand errands to heed whathappened before its eyes.  One or two salesgirls stood still at theirwork, petrified by alarm.  One or two customers hesitated andchuckled.  And then, as the young man with a face of crimsonshouldered his way into a hurried oblivion from which he neverreappeared, the rush of business sent the clerks whirling about theirown tasks and sent the crowd hurrying about its own purposes.But Katie knew that more would follow, and that what would followwould be an interview with Mr. Porter.  The shop\\'s system ofsurveillance missed nothing, and within a half-hour the girl wasstanding in the dark office where she had first been hired.In his likeness to a Sunday-school superintendent Mr. Porter wasshocked and grieved to hear that any young lady in the Lennox storewould strike a purchaser.  In his likeness to a surgeon he promptlydeclared that there ought to be no issue short of expulsion.  And inhis own hidden character--deep in his own abominable character--hewas wondering whether he could not turn this incident to theadvantage that he had so long sought.\"The viper was insultin\\' me,\" said Katie.\"Are you quite sure of that, Miss Flanagan?\"\"Sure I\\'m sure.  Do you have to wait for a snake to bite you beforeyou know what he\\'s up to?\"\"You could have called the floor-walker.\"\"And been fined for me pains, Mr. Porter.\"Mr. Porter tapped his desk and kept his eyes on his fingers.\"I find,\" he said slowly, \"that most men do not make approacheswithout some encouragement, in either word or manner, on the part ofthe girl.  I also find that such occurrences as this are very rare inthe experience of most of the girls in our employ.\"He stopped, but Katie stood silent by the arm of the desk, her lipscompressed, a frown between her arched black brows.  He sent acrooked glance up at her, and then resumed:\"I scarcely ever have a case of this sort to deal with.  I wonderwhy, if such things are done by customers, the other girls do notreport them.\"He stopped again, and this time Katie answered:\"I suppose they boss their own lives in their own way, Mr. Porter.\"A faint spark of color shone in Mr. Porter\\'s white cheek.\"I suppose they do,\" he answered, gently pulling at hisside-whiskers, and peeping at his victim over the caressing hand.\"In fact, between you and me, Miss Flanagan, I am told that some ofthem do that so well that they are practically independent of theirwages in this store.\"Again Katie failed to respond.\"Do you understand me, Miss Flanagan?\"Katie thought of her desperate days before she had found her presentemployment.  She thought of Hermann and what seemed to be the solechance of rising to a salary where marriage could be a practicalpossibility.  She thought of Carrie\\'s plight and of Carrie\\'sdependence upon her.\"I do that, Mr. Porter,\" she answered.He looked up squarely then, and she even managed to torture her faceinto an expression of roguery.\"Ah,\" said Mr. Porter, smiling a paternal smile.  He reached out andpatted her hand, and, though her soul revolted, she managed to keepher hand passive.  \"Now, my dear young lady, you are at last comingto your senses.  You mustn\\'t take life so seriously.\"\"I\\'ll try not to, Mr. Porter.\"\"That\\'s right; that\\'s right.  I ought to discharge you, I know.  Itmay be difficult not to discharge you.  But I will do this much: Iwill suspend judgment for a few days.\"He looked at her fixedly.  Her cold lips formed another phrase ofthanks.\"And in the meantime,\" he continued, \"you let me know of some eveningwhen you can come out to a quiet corner where we can have suppertogether, and where we won\\'t be wasting the firm\\'s time.  Then we\\'lltalk this whole thing over, and I\\'ll see what I can do.\"The eyes of neither wavered.\"Thank you, Mr. Porter,\" said Katie again.With that she left him, but she went away with the knowledge that hergame of hide-and-seek was almost ended.  Just when it would end wasbeyond all guessing, but that it would end soon and that it would endin her defiance of her superiors and her prompt expulsion seemedaltogether certain.  She reflected that the small delay which she hadgained would profit but lightly those in whose interests she hadattempted to truckle and palliate, and, when, that night, she toldher experience to Carrie, her words fell upon ears that read intothem a portentous meaning.The homely, brown-haired Lithuanian, whose cheeks were less round nowthan they had been, and whose hair that needed no covering in thesummer, was still uncovered, went to her weary picket-duty inWaverley Place the next morning--the morning, as it happened, thatpreceded Hermann\\'s little brush with Mirka--with a slow step and aheavy heart.  She knew the futility of the work she was performing;she saw it even in the relaxed vigilance of the policemen on thecorners and in the mocking grins of the girls and toughs at thegloomy factory-door.  All day as, sometimes companioned and sometimesalone, she plodded her eventless round, the irony of the task bitinto her soul.  Something she must do, and soon.  Already she wasdeep in Katie\\'s debt, and Katie was near dismissal.The early autumn twilight dropped among the grimy buildings.  Theevening tide of Broadway rose and roared into Waverley Place.  A coldwind lashed the dust into little whirlpools, wound the girl\\'s cheaplawn skirt tightly about her aching knees, and ate through that thinmaterial to the tingling skin.  There was no one with her now, andshe felt more than ever alone.From the shadow of a doorway a man crossed the street and approachedher.He was a man of uncertain age, of almost any age below the earlythirties.  As he bowed to her, the girl saw that his hair was darkand curly; that the back of his hand, which was not the hand of aworker, was covered with a black down, and that through the paleolive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks there shone the blue-blackbanners of a wiry beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thickuntil they smiled, above white teeth, in greeting, and his grayglance had the character of an appraisement of whatever it lookedupon.  Carrie noticed, protruding from his breast-coatpocket, apurple bordered handkerchief.\"Hello,\" he said.She looked at him gravely.  She had never seen him before, but withhis kind she had lately grown enough familiar.  Wherever there arewomen on strike, men of his sort gather, as the vultures gather aboutdying animals in a jungle.  Yet Carrie said nothing.  She was, as shehad expressed it to Katie, still wondering.\"I\\'ve been _vatch_in\\' you,\" said the man.  \"I\\'ve been vatchin\\' youall _tay_.\"\"Have you?\"  Carrie was totally incurious.\"Yes, I\\'d think you\\'d be pretty tired of sooch _fool_ishness.\"\"I am tired.\"\"You can\\'t vin.  If you go back it will be _choost_ the samehell-mill it vas be_fore_.\"\"I suppose it would.\"\"Vell then\"--his hands spread themselves in protest--\"vhy don\\'t you_qvit_?  A pretty, strong girl like you could make _loads_ of moneyfer herself.\"Carrie was leaning against the factory wall.  She did not move.\"How?\" she asked.\"Vell, you hafn\\'t got no _od_der trade, eh?\"\"No.\"\"Und you vouldn\\'t vant to be a _ser_vant?\"\"Why not?\"\"Because that\\'s vorse nor a _shirt_vaist-factory.\"\"Then I wouldn\\'t want to be a servant.\"Again the man extended his hands.\"Vell?\" he said.\"But I knew one girl that went into a house,\" affirmed Carrie, \"and Iwouldn\\'t do that for a fortune.\"Her practical manner might have disconcerted most men, but this man\\'sbusiness had accustomed him to all forms of rejoinder.  Heimmediately began an endeavor to persuade her by economic arguments.But Carrie interrupted him.\"No,\" she said, \"if I do it, it will be only because I have to, andthen I\\'ll not do it that way.  Thank you, just the same.  Here comesmy relief: I don\\'t have to wait till the girls come out to-day.Good-by.\"He essayed to protest, but she walked quietly by him, made her briefreport to the oncoming women, and started on her journey homeward.The man, whose trade imposed patience, said no more.  He did notagain approach her, and, though she knew that he was following her,through the growing crowd that rolled eastward, to mark herhiding-place, she did not attempt to elude him.  She was very tired.This was the evening that preceded the early morning call of Angelthe Italian and Mirka the Austrian to Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon, andit was about eight hours later that Hermann, having seen hisassailants leave, turned his back to the bar-room door and, alone inthe place, set about washing the discarded glasses.  Except that hewas sleepy, he was in his usual spirits and he was whistling \"DieWacht Am Rhein.\"  He was whistling so loudly that he did not hear thedoor reopen.There was a flash as of a thousand blinding lights, a roar as if atrain had fallen from the elevated road overhead, and Hermann, in thesmoke-filled saloon, himself fell crashing behind the bar, and laythere, huddled and still.Mirka quietly reclosed the door and darted around the corner.XXIITHE SERPENTS\\' DENPoverty, which produces the slave, breeds, just as surely, theslaver.  Take where you will the trail of the trafficker in women,this rule is proven.  It is proven in puritan Boston and protectedNew Orleans, in Chicago and Washington, in Philadelphia and SanFrancisco, and on the heroic scale it is nowhere more plainly proventhan in the heroic city of New York.On Manhattan Island is, indeed, the Mother-Church, howeverunconsciously organized, of the black faith, and though, ofnecessity, there spontaneously arise elsewhere congregations thatreach back to her, here is founded and established the Congregationof the Propaganda that reaches out to them.  Its missionaries--itswomen, men, and methods--have stretched to Nome and the Canal Zone;they are preaching their own brand of dogma against the nativeversions of Buenos Ayres and Sydney, of Shanghai and Cape Town; andwithin its home city the hierarchy is entrenched by financialstrength, political power, and legal negligence.  As an industry, ithas its wholesalers and retailers; or, as a church, its bishops sitin their national house of peers, while its younger orders, itsproselyting priests and evangelizing deacons, perform their especialtasks, the young appealing to the young, the poor preying uponpoverty.The entrance to these lower orders lies, as in most orders and mostbusinesses, through a period of probation: the lad of sixteen playsthe rôle of watchdog and spy for his superiors, for which he earns anoccasional fifty-cent piece, or a casual kettle of beer, vastlyincreasing his income if he now and then diverts, as he generallydoes, his energies to the occupation of amateur theft.  From thisstage he is admitted, by his own efforts, to the possession of onegirl, whom he bullies into working for him along the streets.  He mayoccasionally deign to appear as a waiter in a café, and offer hiswoman to its drunken habitués; but most frequently he scorns allmenial labor, for which, in fact, conditions have utterly unfittedhim.  Sometimes he increases his slave-holdings to a trio of women,and even farms out his victims to friends in his own or otherneighborhoods or towns: more often he delivers his human wares to theproprietors of houses intended for their reception, being paid in alump sum, or on a royalty basis; but in either case his ambition is,naturally, to rise to the position of the large property-holder orthe political receiver of tribute.  If he is an Italian, commonconsent limits his operations to the southern end of the Bowery; ifhe is a Jew, his field lies about the Houston and Essex Streetsdistricts; whatever his European parentage, he seeks hisfellow-countrywomen, and if he is American born he has the freedom ofBroadway.His means are multitude.  Wherever there is squalor seeking ease, heis there.  Wherever there is distress crying for succor, discontentcomplaining for relief, weariness sighing for rest, there is thismissionary, this \"cadet,\" offering the quack salvation of histemporal church.  He knows and takes subtle advantage of the Jewishsisters sent to work for the education of Jewish brothers; the Irish,the Germans, the Russians, and the Syrians ground in one or anothereconomic mill; the restless neurotic native-daughters untrained forwork and spoiled for play.  He is at the door of the factory when itreleases its white-faced women for a breath of night air; he is atthe cheap lunch-room where the stenographers bolt unwholesome noondayfood handed about by underpaid waitresses; he lurks around the cornerfor the servant and the shop-clerk.  He remembers that these aregirls too tired to do household work in their evenings, too untaughtto find continued solace in books; that they must go out, that theymust move about; and so he passes his own nights at the restaurantsand theaters, the moving-picture shows, the dancing academies, thedance-halls.  He may go into those stifling rooms where immigrants,long before they learn to make a half-complete sentence of what theycall the American language, learn what they are told are Americandances: the whirling \"spiel\" with blowing skirts, the \"half-timewaltz\" with jerking hips.  He may frequent the more sophisticatedforms of these places, may even be seen in the more expensive cafés,or may journey into the provinces.  But he scents poverty from afar.Where training is as yet too strong or distress too weak to makeserve the offer of partnership, the promise of marriage usuallysuffices.  The thing is done, and once done, blows and starvationperpetuate it with the ignorant, and threats of exposure and publicshame rivet the shackles on the more knowing.  The former suffer fortheir darkness; the latter are held the faster in proportion to theirprevious respectability.One has said that this church is established; in every city itmaintains its incestuous marriage to the state.  It controls realvotes by the thousands and provides false ones by the tens ofthousands.  It is a church that may be considered to exercise the oldecclesiastical right of trying its own offenders in its own courts.When the magistrates have not begun as slavers, when they own nopoor, but highly rented, houses, leased for prostitution, when theydo not even accept tithes from the traffic, it is still largely thetraffic that elects and can defeat them.  What the Black Church owesto the political powers for their protection, the political powersowe to the church for its ballots.It was this condition that made possible the impunity of such a deedas the Austrian Mirka had done upon Hermann Hoffmann, the bar-keeper;that made certain the assailant\\'s escape, and that made of the entirematter merely a question as to which of several handy means should beemployed to free the slaver in the eyes of the law.  About thosemeans there had, however, been some debate, and so it befell that,early on the Sunday evening following the shooting, Rafael Angelellisat in a recognized New York meeting-place of the church\\'sproselyting order, engaged in pleasant converse with Wesley Dyker,candidate for a magistracy.  This place was the back-room of asaloon.  It was filled with cigarette-smoking young missionaries, whotalked shop, and quoted prices, and discussed the prospects of a goodseason in precisely the businesslike way that men in alivestock-dealers\\' club talk shop, and quote prices, and discuss theprospects of a good season.  Dyker had not at all wanted to comethere, but O\\'Malley had ordered, and so, making peace with thetolerant Angelelli, he had been forced to obey.  A special counselfor the sheriff of New York had once been a member of the legal corpsof the missionaries and so had two State Senators: O\\'Malley,remembering Dyker\\'s previous career, could see no reason for presentpride.The room was clouded with smoke.  Waiters hurried about serving beerfrom brass platters and swabbing the small tables with damp rags.There was a buzz of conversation broken by that peculiar form oflaughter which responds only to obscenities, and now and then, out ofthe general clamor, there arose oaths almost technical, descriptionsof women that sounded like auctioneers\\' announcements in ahorse-market, and fragments of stories in which the teller bragged ofa sharp deal he had effected in capturing a slave or in bargainingwith a proprietress.\"I understand,\" said Dyker, with his eyelids characteristicallylowered, \"that you want to see me in regard to something about thisshooting-affair of your friend Mirka.\"Angel\\'s oily head bobbed a ready assent.\"Where\\'s the fellow that was hurt?\"\"In Bellevue.\"\"Is he going to die?\"\"Naw; eet was only a leetle one in hees shoulder.\"\"Anybody else in the bar when it happened?\"\"Naw.\"That was better.  Wesley took a sip of beer.\"Mirka was alone, too?\"\"Yas.\"\"Did the bar-keeper see him?\"\"Naw; hees back was rounda to da door.\"\"There\\'d been a quarrel beforehand, though?\"\"Ah, some small word only.\"\"And nobody saw Mirka come back or leave the place the second time?\"Nobody had seen him.Then how was it that the injured man, in the hospital, had said thatMirka had done the shooting?Angel explained that Hermann based his accusation partly on anuncertain and partial glimpse of Mirka caught in the bar-mirror atthe instant that the shot was fired, but largely on the precedingquarrel.\"This Hoffmann couldn\\'t swear to Mirka\\'s identity from that mereglimpse?\"The Italian thought not.\"Well, then,\" said Wesley, \"it all ought to be easy enough.  Everybar-keeper knows a lot of drunks that might want to hurt him.\"Rafael shrugged.\"You can feex eet,\" he said.  \"Meest\\' O\\'Malley say you feex eet easy.\"\"But,\" replied Dyker, \"I don\\'t see how I can act as Mirka\\'s lawyer,unless it is all done quickly.  You know, I\\'m about to be electedmagistrate.\"\"Poof!\" said Angel, blowing a thin spiral of blue cigarette-smoke.\"We gotta da lawyer.\"\"Oh!\"  Dyker looked up quickly, and quickly down again.  \"Then youwant me--I see.\"\"Good.\"The prospective magistrate began making rings on the table with hiswet glass.\"But I should think there were other ways.  The man hasn\\'t beenarrested yet?\"\"Naw.\"\"Then why need the police find him?\"\"Thees O\\'Malley say eet looka better.\"\"He might jump his bail.\"\"Naw.\"\"It\\'s often done that way.\"\"O\\'Malley say \\'naw\\'.\"\"Or he might go up for trial.  There\\'s no real evidence against him:nobody saw the shot fired.  And besides, even if we couldn\\'t fixthings in court, which is always easy enough, we could get him apardon as we did for Pud Morley or Frank Da Silva.\"But Angel would have none of these propositions.  Michael O\\'Malleywas, it seemed, inexorable.  There had been enough bail-jumping,queer verdicts, and pardons for a few months.  The case must comebefore the new magistrate, and the new magistrate must declare thatthe testimony was not sufficient to warrant holding the prisoner forcourt.\"Where is Mirka now?\" asked Dyker.\"Een Philadelph\\',\" said Angel.\"Loafing?\"\"Naw.  He tooka one of heesa girls along.  I am takin\\' care of deesother one.\"\"Can\\'t we get hold of the Dutchman and make him see who\\'s back of allthis?\"\"Naw; dees Dutch\\' ees a fool.\"\"Won\\'t even be bought?\"\"Naw.\"\"And can\\'t be scared?\"\"Naw; I tell you dees Dutch\\' ees a damn fool.\"Wesley did not like the plan; he did not like it at all; but he wasalready harnessed fast, and he had learned that it was best to followwithout protest the directing rein.  He achieved a smile.\"All right,\" he agreed.The Italian\\'s face lighted with gratification.\"You do eet?\" he asked.\"I\\'ll arrange it; don\\'t worry.\"\"Good!  Good!  That\\'s good!\"Angel\\'s pleasure was so pronounced that Dyker for a momentfeared--though it would have made small difference--lest the cadetmake to the entire company a public announcement of his promise.  Heneed not, however, have worried.  Rafael was wholly used to theselegal fictions and to the etiquette that imposed their formalobservance; his delight took the shape of an order for another pairof drinks, and, those dispatched, he leisurely got upon his littlefeet.\"Now,\" said he, \"I go.  I hava da businesses.\"He smiled wisely at the concluding word.Wesley also rose.\"I\\'ll have to be getting along myself,\" he remarked.\"Ah, but you can stay eef you feel like,\" said Angel.  \"I maka youknow deesa mens.\"\"Thanks.  I do know most of them,\" replied Dyker, nodding to two orthree of the nearby cadets as he spoke.  \"But I have some business,too.  These are busy times with me.\"They both made their way to the saloon\\'s side door.\"Goin\\' so soon?\" chorused some of the habitués as Angel moved amongthem.He nodded, smiling cheerfully.\"Goin\\' to kop out a new skirt?\" inquired one.\"Yas,\" responded Rafael, now with a frank, satisfied chuckle.\"Then here\\'s luck!\" cried another.As the health was being drunk, Dyker passed through the door andturned, alone, into the cool night air of the street.Notwithstanding his natural bias, his severe schooling, and hishonestly cynical and cynically limited view of this portion of hislittle world, he was ashamed of what he had just seen and heard anddone, and he was disgusted.  He walked down the avenue in thedeepened shadows, for the first time in a long while more than halfinclined to ask himself whether what he was to get was worth theprice that he had already begun to pay for it; and for the firsttime, by way of answer, frankly facing the fact that the position ofa corrupt magistrate was not much worse than that of a corruptlawyer, and that neither position was much worse, and both certainlybetter paid, than the position in which his task had been to renderanonymous assistance to the no less dubious course of more esteemedcorporation attorneys.He was too occupied with these reflections, disquieting andconsolatory, to observe well the persons that passed him.  Hecontinued his way along the curb rather because he had started uponit than because he at all cared about whither it led him, much as hewas continuing his progress in the political maze in which his lotwas cast.  He kept his head bent, and so he did not see a pale-faced,large-eyed woman that, turning a hasty corner, almost collided withhim and then suddenly drew back and crossed the street.There were changes in the woman\\'s face, which might have precludedrecognition.  He had last seen her on the eve of a surgical operationand she had looked ill, but now, the cumulative effect of that andmany other crises sat upon her, and it was only in her habitual gait,the swaying languid pace of an unstudied young animal, that he mighthave found enough to recall her to his memory.  But Dyker\\'s eyes weredirected inward and so, when she turned aside to avoid the man thatshe fancied she had wronged, he did not realize that he had almosttouched elbows with the woman he had once rescued, fresh from herdismissal from the sacred precincts of Mrs. Ferdinand Chamberlin\\'shome.She had started away from Washington Square in the same dull pain inwhich she had previously left the Ninth Street boarding-housepresided over by the stony-breasted Mrs. Alberta Turner; she had beenonly a wounded dog, whose sole desire was to find a dark corner inwhich she could suffer unobserved; but slowly there reasserted itselfin her torpid brain that new impulse toward a questioning of lifewhich had so appalled Philip Beekman.  The whole she could not see;her own case bulked so far in the foreground that little else of thepicture was visible to her.  But she knew that an ill-constructedworld was against her; she concluded that all legitimate doors wereclosed upon her, and she felt gradually kindling a wrath that wouldend in general reprisal.How she chanced into Rivington Street she did not know.  She had noclear idea as to where she was to go, except that she must not returnto burden Katie Flanagan.  Yet, almost before she was clearlyconscious of her whereabouts, she found herself accosted by a voicethat proved to come from the lips of Marian Lennox.\"Mary Morton!  How do you do?  Where are you going?  Where on earthhave you been?  Come in here; I\\'m just getting back from a walk.  Iam so anxious to hear how you are getting on, and I have been sodisappointed because you never let me hear from you.\"The rivulet of cheerful words poured from the calm-faced woman withunheeding force.  Each one of them fell upon her auditor with anunintended shock.  Mary, who had almost forgotten the pseudonym underwhich she had been presented at the Settlement, could say nothing.She was carried up the steps and into the house, up the stairs andinto the deserted sitting-room on the second floor; and there shesank limply into a wicker chair beside a magazine-littered table,tête-à-tête with her former benefactress.Marian, all good intentions, rested her delicate chin upon her whitehands.\"Now,\" she said, \"I am anxious to hear all about you.\"Mary, with a perplexed frown, looked hard at the floor.\"Why, there isn\\'t much to tell, Miss Lennox,\" she replied.\"Nonsense.  Of course there is, my dear.  You must understand that Iam interested in everything about you--in everything.\"Mary\\'s eyes sought, for a moment, the pure, cameo-like face.  Theycould see no evil there, and they could see much kindliness.\"Well, then,\" she hesitated, \"I don\\'t know exactly where to begin.\"\"At the beginning, of course.  How do you like your place?\"\"Which place, Miss Lennox?\"\"The place we sent you to.\"\"I\\'m not there no more.\"\"Not there?\"  Marian raised her perfectly arched brows.  \"But, mydear Mary, why not?  Didn\\'t you like it?\"\"I didn\\'t mind.\"\"Then you have found a better place?\"Again Mary studied her questioner.\"Miss Lennox,\" she said, \"I guess you people here have all sorts ofgirls comin\\' around, don\\'t you?\"There was a surprise in this departure, and Marian\\'s deep eyesmirrored it.  The questioner had become the questioned.\"A great many kinds,\" she replied.  \"Why do you ask?\"\"Girls that work at all sorts of things?\"\"To be sure.\"\"And you want to help \\'em?\"\"We try to help them all.\"\"Yes; I thought so.  Can you help \\'em all, Miss Lennox?\"\"When they let us, I think we can.\"\"Then what do you do about them that hasn\\'t been straight?\"Marian softly caught her breath.\"Oh,\" she said; \"I----\"  She had learned, since their last meeting, alittle about the girls concerning whom Mary was inquiring, and shehad learned much regarding the Settlement\\'s attitude toward them; butshe had learned, also, that the work of the place most lay with theflowers that bloomed among the weeds, and so, \"Well, you see,\" shelamely continued, \"Well, we do the best we can.\"\"What\\'s that, please, Miss Lennox?  I\\'ve got a particular reason forwanting to know.\"Marian understood.  She spoke softly, and softly laced and interlacedher long white fingers, resting in her lap.\"We do the best we can, Mary,\" she repeated, more confidently.  \"Whenwe have investigated the case and are sure such a girl is sorry, orwasn\\'t entirely to blame, and that she means to do what is right inthe future, we make her our personal friend.  We encourage her tocome here and talk to us and get all the help possible.  We have heraround to all the entertainments----\"\"Can she learn?\" asked Mary.\"Learn?\"  Marian\\'s voice was puzzled.\"Can she go to the clubs and the classes they talked about when I washere first?\" explained Mary.Marian shook a doubtful head.\"You see that wouldn\\'t do, right away, Mary,\" she said.  \"We have tothink of the other girls, and we have to protect the girls that _are_straight as well as help those that haven\\'t been.  These are theirclubs, after all, and they wouldn\\'t like it, if they knew.  Itwouldn\\'t be just for us to deceive them, and they have the firstclaim on our protection.\"\"Why?\"It was the hardest question that Marian Lennox had ever had put toher.  She tried to form an answer, but though she could think of manythat seemed to her logical, she could think of none that seemed kind.Sympathy sprang to her eyes.  She put out her hands.\"Mary!\" she said.But Mary had received her reply.\"It don\\'t matter, Miss Lennox,\" she said, and she said it so calmlyand so coldly that Marian involuntarily drew back in her chair.  \"Ijust wondered, that was all.\"She stopped an instant.  Her hostess tried to speak and could not,but presently the girl pursued:\"I wasn\\'t square with you, that night you gave me the recommedationto Mrs. Turner, Miss Lennox.  I suppose I ought to\\'ve told you allabout myself, but I had to get work, an\\' I knew if I told you Iwouldn\\'t get no job.  I\\'d been--I\\'d been in a house.  I wanted to getaway, an\\' a man had just got me out a little more\\'n a month or sobefore.\"\"It was not exactly honest of you,\" said Marian.She was sorry as soon as she had spoken, but Mary, showing no sign ofhurt or resentment, was continuing before reparation or explanationcould be made.Very simply she told the hard outward facts of her story.  She didnot give the history of her capture, because her experience with Mrs.Turner, with the homely little woman that had called at theemployment-agency, and with Philip Beekman had shown her that thiscould not lessen the extent of her contamination.  Honestly rejectingher deception of Marian, goaded by that glimpse of Wesley Dyker intoan impulse to make, at any cost to herself, the amend of truth forwhat fault she had committed, she was still more powerfully moved bya determination to accept without reservation the part that the worldhad now assigned her, and to fight under no colors save her own.Marian, her fine face drawn with pain, heard the narrative in asilence broken only when Mary had concluded with her departure fromthe hospital.  The girl had mentioned no names.\"And even this one man,\" murmured Marian at last, \"even this man whohad the courage to rescue you--even he was a visitor at such a place?\"\"Why, of course,\" said Mary, as yet unused to the idea of any blameattaching to the mere male patronage of slavery.  \"How else could Ihave got him for help?\"\"But you said he was in love with that woman who conductedthe--house.\"\"With Miss Rose?\"\"What did you call her?\"\"Mrs. Rose Légère she called herself, but I guess that wasn\\'t hername.  Yes, he was kind of in love with her.  He was one of herfavorites anyhow, but that was just because he had a pull with thepoliticians, you see.  She let him love her so\\'s she could work him,an\\' when I put him wise to that, he was glad to help me.\"Marian clinched her fist.\"The abominable cur!\" she said.\"Oh, no!  Not that,\" protested Mary.  She had failed this man byretracting her affidavit, but she meant to be loyal to himwheresoever she could.  His name slipped from her with no thought ofconsequences.  \"It took a lot of nerve an\\' goodness to do for me whatMr. Dyker done.\"Marian\\'s gaze became fixed.  She was a woman whose whole training hadshaped her against sudden betrayal of emotion, but she needed everyprecept of that training now.  She did not start, she did not flush,but her hands moved to the arms of her chair and gripped them hard.\"Did you say Mr. Wesley Dyker?\" she asked.Her voice did not betray her to the woman opposite, but Mary fearedlest her own desire to defend her deliverer had betrayed him.\"That\\'s who it was, Miss Lennox,\" she admitted, adding anxiously:\"But I didn\\'t go to mention it.\"You won\\'t tell it to no one that could use it against him, will you?\"\"Oh, no!\"  Marian laughed a short, hard laugh and rose to hidewhatever might be seen of her confusion.  \"Oh, no,\" she said; \"Ishan\\'t speak of this to any enemy.\"Her movement had seemed to Mary as a sign that the interview wasending, but the laughter chilled her.  She also rose, and stoodbefore her hostess.\"You don\\'t know him?\" she tremulously inquired.\"I think,\" said Marian, \"that I used to know somebody by some suchname, but I do not know him now.  He need not disturb himself, andwhen you see him you need not disturb him by saying that you spoke ofthis to me.\"\"Oh, I won\\'t see him,\" Mary assured her.  \"It ain\\'t likely I\\'ll eversee see him again.\"Marian\\'s eyes searched her, but they detected nothing disingenuous.\"You have quarreled?\" she demanded.\"No, only he wanted me to testify against Miss Rose, an\\' I was tooscared.  I just hid myself.\"There was a simple appeal in the bare words that brought their hearerto her better self.  Within her there burned a new and mounting fire,but her face was cool and her actions were reasoned.\"Mary,\" she said, determined to sink herself and to be true to hercode, \"I am very sorry to have heard all this.  I am sorry that Iseemed harsh when I said you had not been quite honest with us.\"\"But I hadn\\'t been, Miss Lennox.\"\"It was not altogether your fault if you weren\\'t, Mary.  I begin tosee that it must be rather hard, sometimes, to be quite honest.\"\"It is, sometimes.\"\"But you have been honest now with me, and I want to help you.  Iwant you to come around here in the way I described.  I want you tocome often.\"She paused, and then, as Mary did not respond, she added:\"Will you?\"Mary\\'s eyes were on the floor.\"Do you think you can get me a job?\" she asked.  \"Do you think anyonecan?\"Marian had thought nothing about it.\"Why, really, I don\\'t know, Mary.  But I suppose so.  Anyhow, I\\'llsee what I can do--though of course I shouldn\\'t feel justified inprocuring you a position under false pretenses.  You understand that?\"\"Yes,\" said Mary, \"I understand.\"\"And, at any rate, you will come around to-morrow?\"Still Mary did not look up.\"You will come?\" repeated Marian.\"Yes, Miss Lennox,\" said Mary.\"Very well, then: to-morrow afternoon.\"Something in the girl\\'s attitude made Marian uneasy.  She insisted onher point, but again Mary was slow to answer, and again Marian asked:\"Will you?\"\"Yes, Miss Lennox.\"\"At five o\\'clock, Mary.\"\"I\\'ll try, Miss Lennox.\"\"Promise.\"Mary stepped to the door.  She looked up and put out her hand, but,although Marian saw this, and started to respond, thesettlement-worker\\'s hand fell back to her side.  Mary seemed first toobserve and then not at all to have observed it.\"I promise,\" she said quietly, and left the room and the house.Inside, Marian was looking at her hand as if, because it had refusedto seek that of the woman who, she concluded, had shared RoseLégère\\'s intimacy with Dyker, it had been scorched by the new passionaflame in her own heart.  Outside, Mary, tramping the evening street,saw, in her memory of that hand withheld, a hand pointing herdefinitely away from the keeping of her promise, pointing her onwarddown the street as the place where, for the future, she must live andwork.XXIIIKATIE\\'S DAYThe election came, and went in just the way that everybody expectedit to go.  Wesley Dyker\\'s political craft, along with many others,was carried on the inrushing waves of his party\\'s success to thehaven where he had desired it to rest, and the prosperity that hadraised the price of votes to five dollars apiece immediately resumedits unostentatious levy upon the voters against the next election.The defeated candidates forgot their so recent denunciations andcongratulated their victorious opponents; the victorious opponentsforgot their tinsel pledges and resumed the safe and sure business ofgovernment for revenue only, and the population of New York, like thepopulation of most cities, forgot all the good things that had beenpledged it, and turned its energies to the everyday task of takingwhat it could get.Meanwhile Carrie Berkowicz, homely and hopeless, pursued, with adogged earnestness, the path that conditions had hewn for her, andalways she pursued it not alone.  As the waiting beast prowls behindthe slowly weakening traveler lost in a jungle, as the bird of preycircles calmly above the wounded man in the forest, as both beast andbird stand by until there comes the moment when strength can nolonger oppose them, so, day after day, rarely speaking, but alwayswatching, there followed in this girl\\'s footsteps the dark young manwith curling hair and shining teeth, who had accosted her on WaverleyPlace.  He seemed to watch for her morning entrance upon the street,and to be the last to see her when she dragged her wasting body intothe tenement at night.  Much of the time he dogged her like a foulshadow.  She would pass him in a doorway, she would see him loungingat a corner, she would catch glimpses of him across a crowded street.There were times when she feared to look up lest she should have toanswer that prosperous leer and ornate bow; there were others, atlast, when, as his well-fed body brushed by her, she almost pluckedat his sleeve with her hungry hands.  He never stopped, but sometime,she knew, he would stop; he never said more than \"Good-morning\" or\"Good-evening,\", but sometime, sometime soon, he would, she knew, saymore.And meanwhile, too, the politically unaffected routine of the Lennoxdepartment-store began gradually to provide for one of its victims atleast the sense of approaching variety: Katie Flanagan realized thatthe end of her usefulness--as that phrase is termed by employers,boarding-school principals, and others in authority--was rapidlynearing.  She managed to avoid the immaculate Mr. Porter for oneweek, and, but for her worry over the condition of the woundedHermann, would have had moments when the sport was amusing.  As thetaskmaster paused at her counter one time during the second week, sheachieved a sick aunt, who sufficed to account for her occupiedevenings.  But when the days and the nights dragged by with no changefor either the better or the worse in the condition of thisbed-ridden relative, and when the girl\\'s invention began to flag, andher spirit to tire, Mr. Porter\\'s glance grew more and more searching,his manner less and less warm, and Katie knew that she must soonretreat or surrender.\"I have not seen much of you lately, Miss Flanagan,\" remarked Mr.Porter as, late one afternoon, he came mincing to the counter whereshe stood.\"I\\'ve been here pretty regular, Mr. Porter,\" answered Katie.Mr. Porter caressed a gray side-whisker.\"Um,\" said he.  \"I presume, then, that your grandmother is no worse.\"\"It\\'s me aunt, sir,\" rejoined Katie, with the mental addition: \"Youdidn\\'t catch me that time, you ould tom-cat.\"  And she added: \"Thegood woman\\'s some better, thanks.\"\"I see,\" said Mr. Porter, and, indeed, his cold gaze seemed to see agreat deal more than he was inclined to mention.  \"At this rate ofimprovement, I hope you will soon find time to consider the matter wediscussed that day in my office.\"\"I hope that, Mr. Porter,\" smiled Katie.\"Yes,\" concluded Mr. Porter, turning from her--he always turned awaywhen he was most significant.  \"I hope so, too, for I can\\'t well keepyour case under advisement much longer.\"Several of the salesgirls nearby laughed openly, and Katie, when hewas out of sight, looked at them with a grimace half sad, halfmocking.The next morning she was transferred to a bargain-counter for the day.What the outcome might have been there is no imagining.  What it wasdepended, at any rate in part, upon the fact that, on what proved tobe her last day at the shop, she had come to work with a tired bodyand an aching head.  She had sat up half the night in a long endeavorto persuade Carrie to leave the futile battle of the strikers andturn to other employment; and, when Carrie had rejected all proposalson the ground that, though the fight was lost, she knew no other sortof work, Katie had spent about all the remainder of the dark hours inan attempt to convince her roommate that the Irish girl\\'s wages wereenough to support both of them for some time to come.  The result, sofar as went her conduct at the store, was a temper ready to explodewith the first spark, and that spark came when, in midafternoon, anervous woman, who persisted in examining everything and buyingnothing, interpreted Katie\\'s lassitude as indifference and soreported it to the floor-walker.Katie was sent for to come to Mr. Porter\\'s office.Mr. Porter looked up from the light at his desk, and then down again.He stroked a whisker.\"Sit down, Miss Flanagan,\" he said.\"Thanks,\" replied Katie, \"I can take it just as well standin\\'.\"\"Take what?\" asked Mr. Porter.\"Anythin\\' at all you have to say,\" said Katie.Mr. Porter continued to look at his desk and, by the name of \"MissFlanagan,\" addressed it severely.\"Miss Flanagan,\" he said, \"you have again been reported to me fordiscourtesy to a customer.  The other case had not yet been adjusted.It might have been adjusted had not your cousin----\"\"Me aunt,\" prompted Katie.\"Your aunt,\" frowned Mr. Porter to his desk, \"had not your aunt beenso disinclined to recover.\"\"She was gettin\\' absent treatment from a bad doctor.\"\"I know nothing of that----\"\"I think meself it was Malicious Animal Magnetism.\"\"Please do not interrupt,\" said Mr. Porter, shaking his whiskers atthe desk.  \"I say that the previous case was not adjusted, though itmight have been, if your mother had not remained so ill.\"\"Me aunt.\"\"Your aunt, if you prefer it.  Now comes this second case, andreally, I am curious to know whether you can suggest anything thatwill make me regard it with the smallest degree of lenience.\"He looked again at the desk, as if the desk were the case he hadreferred to, but neither the desk nor Katie answered.\"If you cannot,\" he at last concluded, \"I see no course but one forme to pursue.\"Katie folded her arms across her breast and tossed her black head.\"There\\'s only one thing I can think of,\" said she, and waited.Mr. Porter breathed hard.\"And what,\" he inquired, still without looking at her, \"is that?\"Katie took a soft step forward.  She rested her hands upon the arm ofhis desk and leaned her face toward him.\"Don\\'t you know?\" she asked in a low voice.Mr. Porter shot, from the corner of his eyes, one of his crookedglances at her.\"I am not quite sure,\" he said.\"Then,\" replied Katie, \"I\\'ll tell you.  The only one thing I canthink of that\\'d get you to let me off is the only one you can thinkof yourself--_an\\' that\\'s the one I won\\'t do!_\"Her voice, which had begun so softly, ended in a loud note.  Herhands, which had been open, clinched.  Her body, which had beenrelaxed, stiffened.Mr. Porter sprang back from her, looked at her with hot fright in hisusually cool eyes, and then shrank as far away as his desk-armchairwould permit.\"Miss Flanagan,\" he spluttered, \"not so loud, please!  You will alarmthe store.\"\"I wish I could alarm it!\" said Katie.\"But what--what--I don\\'t understand----\"\"Yes, you do understand, all right, all right, Mr. Porter.  I knowwhat you want; I\\'ve known it all along, an\\' if I hadn\\'t liked to makea fool of you, I\\'d have told you long since what I tell you now: _Youwon\\'t get it!_\"If it were possible for Mr. Porter to grow whiter than his habit, hegrew whiter then.\"I shall--I shall ring for assistance!\" he protested.\"No you won\\'t; you won\\'t dare; you\\'ll sit there, an\\' write me out arecommendation an\\' an order for me pay--if your hand ain\\'t shakin\\'too much, an\\' if it is, I\\'ll write it for you.\"And he did write it.  After one look at her, he wrote it without aword, and \"without,\" as Katie carefully stipulated, \"any dockin\\' forthe last offense,\" and as she left him she delivered one Parthianbolt.\"Remember me to the girl you start after in the mornin\\',\" she said;\"an\\' when you go home to-night, just give megrandmother-mother-aunt-cousin\\'s best regards to your grown-upgreat-grandchildren.\"The taste in which her revolution expressed itself may have been asdoubtful as the courage that inspired it was certain; but, had Mr.Porter been able to see into her mind as she hurried homeward, hewould have been gratified at what he found there.  The excitement hadgone, and with it the bravery.  She had preserved her individualideals, but she now realized at what a cost she had preserved them.Against masculine attack it was sometimes inspiriting to defendherself, but to the slow and continuous advance of penury she wellknew that, at last, she must succumb.She passed her ugly little parish-church, and, remembering that shehad missed her last confession, entered its forbidding doors.The swinging portal closed softly behind her.  It shut out the glareof the day, it shut out the noises of the street, and it seemed toshut out the entire malicious power of the world.  Inside the cruelsunshine became kindly shade and comforting candle-light; the onlysound was the occasional footfall of an unseen suppliant, and on thedistant high altar, shimmering and white at the end of the longperspective of the empty aisle, there rested the power she believedmore powerful than all on earth beside.She made her confession--not the easy and formal confession of thestrong, who need it most, but the frank probing question and fullreply of the weak, who can profit by it least--and at its end shereceived not only the benediction that she traced to Heaven, but theshrewd advice that came direct from the big heart of a worldly-wiseand beneficent man.\"Thank you, father,\" she added to the words of the ritual, as sherose to go, \"I\\'ll do me best to stick it out, but times be when it\\'spowerful hard.\"The experience had encouraged her, but, when she came at last intoher barren home, there fell a blow that shook to its foundations thestructure of hope which she had so briefly reared.  On the bare tablewas a single sheet of paper, and on the paper was written:\"Dear Katie:--I have gone away.  There was no use in saying good-by,for that would only have hurt both of us, and I could not have madeyou see that I was right not to board here any longer at yourexpense, any more than you could make me see last night that you wereright on your side.  Pretty soon I\\'ll come to see you and bring themoney I owe you, but I can\\'t ever pay you back all your othergoodness, although I would give my right arm to do it.\"Another thing.  By the time you get this letter Hermann will be tosee you at the store.  I was around to Bellevue yesterday, and wekept it as a surprise for you that he was coming out to-day.  I hopeby this time you two will have fixed it all up; but if you haven\\'t,well, I never talked to you about it much before, but I feel I mustsay something now, because I seem to know more about life than I usedto: take him, Katie dear, for there are only horrors ahead for anygirls like you and me if we don\\'t marry.  He\\'s a fine man and youlove him, and the two of you will do better together than you can doapart.\"Now, good-by.  Don\\'t please bother to hunt for me--I won\\'t be onpicket-duty any more, but _I am all right_.  \"Lovingly,      \"CARRIE.\"Katie Flanagan put down the note.  She went to the narrow window andgazed blindly at the unsightly wing of the tenement across the narrowcourt outside.\"All right?\" she said, the paper crumpling in her tightened hand.\"All right?  The poor girl\\'s got no money an\\' no job.  I know whatshe\\'s thinking an\\' there\\'s no good followin\\'.  \\'All right,\\' she says!Dear God, pity her: she means, \\'all wrong\\'!\"Katie felt too deeply for her lost comrade to think much, if at all,of that portion of the note which touched her own interest.  Her eyesclouded; her shoulders shook; she fell upon her knees before thewindow-sill, and it was there that Hermann\\'s strong arms went abouther neck.Even then, glad as she was to have him back again, she could dolittle but sob brokenly with her cheek against his breast, while hetold her how he had gone to the store, learned of her dismissal, andcome at once to the tenement, not pausing to knock when he heard hersobs.  He comforted her as best he could, but it was some time beforeany comfort availed.All had ended well for Hermann, but all had not easily so ended.  Hiswound had proved relatively slight, and he was sound and whole again:but, the day before his dismissal from the hospital, Schleger hadwaited upon him shamefacedly to confess that the rulers of the ward,dissatisfied with the bar-keeper\\'s Laodicean attitude toward theirpolitical labors, and urged by Mirka\\'s friends, had forbidden hisre-engagement in the saloon.  Ludwig had been sorry, but helpless,and then, after exacting a score of promises, had disclosed his planto open incognito a grocery-store on the West Side, himself remainingin charge of the saloon and Hoffmann appearing, on a good salary, asthe owner of the new venture.Katie looked up at him with eyes shining blue through a dispersingmist of tears.\"An\\' what about the dirty Dago that shot you?\" she inquired.Hermann smiled broadly.  His face was thinner and not so ruddy asonce, but it was cheerful still and more determined than of old.\"The Austrian?\" he asked.\"\\'Tis the same thing,\" said she.\"Ach, vell, I guess ve von\\'t do nussing about him.\"\"You won\\'t be lettin\\' him go?\"\"Vhy not?  Dere\\'s none to swear fur me and a hun\\'red to swear furhim.  I kind of belief Schleger gif me de new blace as brice furkeepin\\' quiet, so dere\\'s nussing to gain und efferysing to lose.\"At first she would not hear of it, and she used her opposition tothis dropping of the charge against Mirka as if it were an argumentproperly formed to oppose the next scheme that he proposed to her.But he had found her in her moment of weakness when he had come toher in his hour of strength renewed.\"No,\" he said firmly, \"und dis evenin\\' ve\\'ll be married.  I got derlicense; I stopped at der church; Father Kelly\\'s vatin\\'--dis evenin\\',Katie.\"The world was slipping from beneath her feet.  She did not answer.\"In two year\\',\" he went on, \"one part of dot store ve\\'ll own.  Katie,it\\'s our chance; und in de meanvhile, if der Herr Gott sends derbabies--und pray Gott he vill--dey von\\'t at least do no vorse as vehof done.\"He drew her tighter, but she twisted in his arms and got free, sothat he held only one of her firm hands.  They stood there face toface, between them the unfathomable chasm of sex, their feettrembling at its brink.Across the areaway the straight shafts of the setting sun caught thedirty little window-panes of the nearby squalid rooms and turned themto a shining glory.  The rays were reflected into Katie\\'s own room;they burnished the cheap paper into cloth of gold, they touched thefloor and gilded it, they made of the rickety table a thing ofsplendor, and of the worn chairs fairy thrones.  Hermann\\'s blondehead was crowned with a halo, and as he looked at the girl, againstthe background of those yellow windows like a Madonna against thebackground that the Etruscan painters loved, he saw in her eyes whathe had never seen before.In the momentary struggle the coils of her black hair had loosenedand fallen below her waist.  They framed a face no longer strong withrestraint, handsome from the flush of battle against the world, nolonger set and self-reliant, but a face through which shone the lightof the life-force, the motive-power of the universe, a beautifulface, white, frightened, wonderful.\"Can--can you really love me?\"She scarcely said the words.  Rather her lips formed them with novoice behind.  But he had heard her before her lips so much as moved.\"Ach,\" he cried, \"I hof alvays lofed you, Katie, but now it issomesing new und more.  Katie, I sink--I belief sings I neffer beliefbefore, und I sink it must be der blessing of Gott dot I can _see_ inyou.\"\"An\\' there won\\'t be anny other woman?\"\"You are _all_ vomen, Katie.\"She raised her head.\"Yes, Hermann,\" she said, \"I think I will be all women for you.  Iwill be all you want.  I will work an\\' share, good luck an\\' bad.  Inever before was glad I knew how to work, but now I _will_ be all youwant--all, _all_!\"He put her hand to his lips, and held it there an instant: FifthAvenue does these things, casually, no better than the Bowery, whenthe Bowery has a mind for them.\"Katie,\" he whispered.She took her hand away.  She tried to laugh a little, but thelaughter, clear and silvery, caught suddenly in her throat.  Hermouth twisted, and she raised the hand and put her lips where his hadbeen.Reeling with the tremor of that sight, his arms recaptured her, andthis time held her fast.  She swayed and yielded.  Her own armsanswered his, and his lips met, for the first time freely, the lipsshe had so bravely kept for him.The case against Mirka was then and there dismissed, and the HighCourt handed down a final decision _in re_ Hoffmann _vs._ Flanagan.XXIVMARIAN\\'S WAYWesley Dyker looked with unaffected approval about the second-storyfront room in Rivington Street.  He saw the calmly colored walls, theexcellent mats upon the floor, the ordered writing-desk and, near thecenter, the heavy library-table, covered with carefully piledmagazines.\"Hello!\" he said, nodding easily to the woman that stood motionlessbefore him.The woman\\'s answer was not ready, but Dyker, whose eyes were onsurroundings almost as animate, pursued:\"Upon my word, you have it rather cozy here, considering theneighborhood.  I\\'m not half so well fixed myself.  I\\'m glad to seethat, Marian, and I\\'m more than glad to see you.\"He raised his heavy lids to look at her.  He had resolved when, ashort while before, she had sent for him, to make no mention of theirlong separation.  He was sure that the sending meant he was to have achance to recall to her the superior wisdom that had expressed itselfin his advice against working among the poor; but of the time thathad elapsed since that advice was given he had meant to say nothing.Always he had confidently expected this moment, and, now that it hadcome, she must find him prepared.  He put out his hand.But Marian was thinking of how, in this same room, she had saidgood-by to Mary.  She compressed her lips a moment before answering,and, when she did answer, it was only to say, quite calmly:\"I don\\'t want to shake hands with you, Wesley.\"Day and night the words that Mary had so innocently droppedconcerning Dyker had stirred the fire in Marian\\'s breast.  Supposingthat her protégée had shared with Rose the easy caresses of Wesley,even at a time when Marian had been on the point of accepting them,the failure of that protégée to return to the Settlement for aid orconsolation had made Marian the prey to a hundred contendingemotions.  She was glad that Mary had not come back, because Maryadrift meant Mary suffering.  She was sorry that Mary had not comeback, because she wanted to ask the girl so many things that she hadat first neglected to ask.  She doubted Mary and was ashamed of herdoubts; she doubted Dyker and was still ashamed.  One thought tore atanother, and all tore at her heart.On entering the Settlement she had left Dyker in a proud anger thatforbade her acting upon his offer to come to her whenever she shouldsend for him; on dismissing Mary she had so framed her promise ofsecrecy that she might repeat to Wesley the unfortunate woman\\'sunconscious accusation; and on twisting and turning the reptilianthing over in her mind, she said in one breath that she could notsend for Dyker and could not be at peace unless she did send.  Thefiercest passion that a conventional woman has is the passion for theknowledge that will most likely clinch her unhappiness.  Marian wascertain that she must know the truth, and she told herself that shewas certain of but one fact beside: that she did not love this man;that she had never loved him--and, presumably because of that, shehad at last, on this day shortly after the election, incontinentlytelephoned to him to come to Rivington Street.She had said to herself that it was unfair to condemn him unheard.She had replied to herself that she did not care enough about himeither to condemn or to acquit.  She had ended by the realizationthat, deny it as she might, the fact of condemnation remained; andshe had inclined solely toward the attitude of impartial justiceuntil, in the briefest possible time after receiving her message,Dyker had entered this room.  Then, immediately, her mood had oncemore changed, as it was to change so often during the ensuinginterview; she had left the bench and had become the prosecutor.Perhaps Dyker\\'s appearance was in part to blame for this.  She had,of course, not seen him since that summer parting; it is seldompleasant for a woman to find that separation from her has left noscar upon an admirer, and it is always annoying to adistrict-attorney to detect no consciousness of guilt in thecountenance of the accused; yet Dyker had come into her presence witha buoyant step and a ready smile.  The pressure of campaigning hadlessened, though it could not wholly check, the progress of hisdissipations, and his face still flaunted the tokens of its formerglory.  His eyes were not noticeably more timid than of old, and hismouth was, as of old, hidden.  Add to this the pleasure, still fresh,of his election, and the satisfaction of a man fancying himself justplaced in a position to say \"I told you so\" to the woman he loves,and it will be seen that Magistrate Dyker, if not at his best, hadbeen at least in a moment of expansion.And now she had said that she would not take his hand!  He couldscarcely believe his ears.\"You don\\'t want--I am afraid I do not understand you, Marian,\" hesaid.Her great brown eyes looked steadily into his puzzled gaze.\"Sit down, please,\" she responded.Mechanically, he drew a deep wicker chair to the window, and obeyedher.She sat opposite him and, for fully a minute, while with gallopingbrain he watched her, she looked through the glass at crowded,shuffling Rivington Street.\"It is simple enough, Wesley,\" she at last resumed.  \"Before I canthink of renewing anything like my old friendly attitude towardyou----\"\"Your friendly attitude!\"\"It was scarcely more than that.  Before I can renew it, there issomething that must be explained.\"Dyker\\'s own attitude was still that of the average lover, and theaverage lover cannot see beyond his own shadow.\"Oh,\"--he was momentarily relieved and prepared, in consequence, toshow a proper magnanimity--\"you needn\\'t explain, Marian!  I knew youwould find that I was right, and that this was no place for you.  Iappreciate perfectly how you feel: you have been disappointed anddisillusioned, and it is like you handsomely to want to confess thatyou were wrong.  But let\\'s merely consider that done, and say no moreabout it.\"He ended in a warmth of good feeling; but the did not seem inclinedto accept this proffer, and, as he paused, he wondered what was inher gaze.\"No,\" she said, \"you are not quite correct in your surmise.  I havebeen disappointed and disillusioned.  I have been disappointed in oneof the people among whom I have been working; but I have beendisillusioned in regard to you.\"She stopped.  He began to guess now what was back of those calm eyesof hers.  Disillusioned in regard to him?  At the first breath itseemed incredible, but at the next his mind filled with the ghosts ofhis experience, the grim figures that compose the pageant of thatreal life of a man, upon which he never raises the curtain for thefeminine eyes most dear to him.\"In regard to me?\" he echoed.  He was wondering, in hidden panic,which especial image had been revealed to her, and he sought defensein general denial.  \"You have been listening to East Sideneighborhood gossip, Marian, and I shouldn\\'t have believed it of you.You have heard one of the hundreds of groundless ante-election libelsthat are the common ammunition used against anyone in politics.\"Her face, always fair, was gently tinted.\"What I have heard,\" she replied, \"I heard from somebody that hasnothing to do with politics.\"\"Down here,\" insisted Dyker, still seeking to dislodge the enemy andforce it into the open field of recognition, \"down here all the menhave something to do with politics.\"\"This was a woman, Wesley.\"He had feared that.  He had feared it when she first spoke of comingto the Settlement.  But he wasted no time in such thought; he must,before he committed himself, discover which of several possiblewomen, was concerned.\"Oh,\" he laughed, \"the women are mixed up in political gossip, too;or, at any rate,\" he added, \"they are always glad to repeat whattheir menfolk don\\'t hesitate to tell them.\"\"The woman I refer to was a part of the thing she told.\"Marian said it softly, but her white throat trembled.Dyker looked at her swiftly, and as swiftly lowered his eyes.Instantly now he guessed what it was that she had heard; an instantmore and he thought the thing improbable.  Then, resolved at allevents not to approach self-betrayal by showing his intuition, heassumed the point of view of the lawyer.\"Marian,\" he said, pulling at his mustache that she might see--as shedid--that his hand was steady, \"is this fair?  Is it right to condemnme on a charge of which I know nothing and because of evidence ofwhich I haven\\'t heard a syllable?\"\"No,\" she answered, \"it isn\\'t fair.  That is why I sent for you.\"He bit his lip, but faced her.\"Well,\" he said, \"what is it?\"Steadily she met his renewed gaze until his eyes failed her.Even then her own eyes, never wavering, could find in him not enoughto determine her.  The desire to get at the truth, whatever the truthmight be, was plying its angry whip upon her shoulders.  When Maryhad spoken, Marian had received the intelligence as innocentlyimparted fact.  But now the man before her gave nothing that herinexperience could set down as a sign of what she considered a greatsin.\"Wesley,\" she began, leaning towards him, \"the girl that told me thistold it inadvertently.  More than that, she did not even know that Ihad ever heard of you.  She did not want to hurt you: she wasgrateful to you, because you had rescued her.\"His intuition, then, had not failed him: it was Violet.\"Why,\" he smiled, his heart heavy with the fear of losing Marian\\'slove, his lips still sparring for a more open lead, \"I am afraid I\\'mno knight-errant, Marian, to go about rescuing damsels in distress.\"But he did not like the sound of the phrase, and, seeing that sheliked it no better, he explained: \"You surely remember how I feelabout these poor women.\"\"But she said that your politics brought you into touch with theworst sort of them.\"Marian paused there to give him another chance, but his only protestwas:\"Not my politics.  The duties of my profession, before I was electeda magistrate, sometimes made it necessary to defend such women.  Youmust have known that.  There was no dishonor there.\"\"And my informant added,\" continued Marian, \"that you used yourpolitical influence to gain their friendship, perhaps even to protectthem, and\"--she felt the depths before her; her cheeks went hot; herbrown eyes filled--\"and certainly to--to----\"She faltered.He felt it and looked up with anger in his eyes.\"To what?\" he demanded.She clasped her damp hands tight.\"To live with them,\" she said.Though he had expected the implication, he had hardly expected soclose an approach to the specific, and therefore the start to whichit behooved him to give way was not altogether disingenuous.\"Marian!\" he cried.She bent her head.\"Do you believe that?\" he asked.The accusation uttered, sick uncertainty gripped and tossed her again.\"I don\\'t know what to believe.\"\"But how can you think I would be capable of such things?  The girllied.\"Her judgment swayed dizzily.  Between word and word she was now forand now against him.\"I can\\'t think of any motive that this girl might have to lie,\" shesaid.\"How do you know what motive she has?\" returned Dyker, realizing inwhat good stead his training as a pleader of bad cases might standhim.  \"How do you know what political enemies of mine may have senther to you?  You say that, on her own confession, she is a vilewoman----\"\"I did not say that.\"\"You said she charged herself with being part of this allegedbusiness.  You confessed that you were disappointed in herpersonally.  What possible credit can be given to the story of awoman that begins by admitting such abominations?\"Marian tried to speak, but indecision choked her.\"I tell you, you were tricked,\" he pursued, with a glib rapidity thatshe did not know whether to attribute to innocence or guilt.  \"I mayhave lost a case for some friend of this girl.  I may have won a suitagainst one of her hangers-on.  There are men in the lower sort ofpolitics, I\\'m ashamed to say, that don\\'t hesitate to use such tools,and I have offended a good many of them.  Before you considered thisstory true, don\\'t you feel that you should have thought of one ofthese explanations?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" Marian faltered.  The relentless tide of her emotionsnow set in again in his favor.  Mary had told her story so calmly,with so little feeling concerning her own sufferings, that Mariankept wondering if it might not have been an invention.  She was surethat, all along, somewhere in her heart, she had wanted to think thebest of him; wanted, despite her accusing jealousy, to acquit him.\"I don\\'t know,\" she repeated despairingly; \"but\"--and the tide beganto flow once more--\"unless I can be certain of her motive for lyingto me, don\\'t you see, Wesley, don\\'t you see that I must have proof ofyour innocence from you?\"She looked at him in wide appeal.  The undertow had caught her, andshe was crying for help from shore.  She knew now that she loved him,and she had learned the ultimate tragedy of love: that love andmistrust may be one.\"How can I know anything?\" she went on.  \"How can I be sure ofanything?  How can I understand such a world as this?  It seems as ifall the earth was lying to me, and as if all the earth could lie andstill look honest.  I trusted the girl; I trusted you.  I beg of youto prove to me that I was right only when I trusted you.Wesley,\"--she almost extended her arms to him--\"tell me that youdidn\\'t do it!\"Dyker saw his advantage, but decided that the way to keep it was tobe firm.  He spoke quickly, yet coldly.\"Who was this woman?\" he asked.\"Do you think I ought to tell you?\" she pleaded.\"Ought to tell me?  Why, Marian, how else am I to prove what you askme to prove?  If you are to be at all fair with me, how can you startby hiding the false witnesses against me?\"He was right, she felt.\"Did you ever hear,\" she asked, \"of Mary Morton?\"Too late to weigh his words he remembered the name that the girl whomhe had called Violet had signed to her affidavit.  Before thatrecollection was clear to him, he made his reply in the deceit thatis the refuge of all the confused.\"I never did.\"\"You are sure?\"\"Absolutely\";--he had to keep it up now--\"although, if she is thesort of woman she says she is, she probably has as many aliases as asafe-cracker.\"\"But this girl--I should think you would not forget her if you hadever known her: she must have been good-looking once.  She has blueeyes and brown hair.  You could see from her face that she hassuffered, but you could see that she used to be almost beautiful.She has the walk of a queen.\"\"I don\\'t know her.\"\"Think.\"--Marian was still intent upon certainty.--\"When I saw hershe was both times dressed alike, though on her second visit herclothes, first new, had grown a little shabby.  She wore a cloak--Iforget its color, but it was dark--and a beaver hat.  She----\"He knew those clothes; he had reason to; but his interruption was instrict accord with his previous denial:\"There are thousands of women answering that vague description.  I amsure, however, that I don\\'t know this one.\"Marian did not observe that, on his own showing, his assurance waswithout foundation.  Her words had brought Mary vividly before herand, for a minute, she well-nigh forgot her own distress in themisery of that figure.\"She has had a great deal of trouble,\" said Marian.  \"Why, from whatshe told me, these girls must be worse treated than the blacks in theCongo; they must be far worse off than our own American negro slavesused to be.\"\"No doubt--if what she said was true.  But I know it was not true.My profession has made me see a great deal of these poor women, and Iknow that if they are slaves it is because they want to be.\"  Hewaved away the whole matter with a toss of his hand.  He wanted someinformation, and he did not want to show why he wanted it.  \"That allgoes to prove that if it was she who told you this foul story aboutme, then the story was that of a born liar,\" he declared.  \"You sayshe was here twice.  What were the circumstances?\"She told him.He breathed more freely.  He had only to convince Marian and get herto quit her work in disgust before further gossip should reach her.\"And so you don\\'t know her?\" she concluded.\"No.\"\"Nor Mrs. Rose Légère?\"\"I certainly know of that person,\" he said--it was the part of wisdomto admit some knowledge.  \"Nobody that knows anything about ourpolice-courts, as I have had to know, can be entirely ignorant ofher.  She is one of the most notorious women in New York.  I know agreat deal about her, but, except for one occasion, when I saw her ina station-house, I have never set eyes on her in my life.\"He spoke with such precision that Marian caught a gratified breath.\"Is she another Settlement visitor?\" inquired Wesley, devoutly hopingthat no miracle of reformation had, since their last meeting, beenwrought upon Rose.\"No, she is not.  It was she that was said to have been one ofyour--your friends, until she made friends with your politicalenemies.  The girl that told me was, of course, the Mary Morton Ihave mentioned.  She said that you were intimate with this Mrs.Légère, and I understood that even Mary----\"Dyker was genuinely glad to find some accusation that he could denywith truth.\"Never!\" he cried.Something in that word and his utterance of it made her look at himhard.\"She didn\\'t want to tell the story,\" Marian insisted.  \"I got it fromher.  How could it have been the result of malice or a plot?  Didn\\'tI tell you that she said you had rescued her from the Légère woman\\'shouse?\"Dyker reflected.  He wished that he had been as sweeping in hisdiscrediting of Violet, under the pseudonym of Mary Morton, as he hadbeen in his discrediting of Rose.  Failing that, he might even haveexplained this rescue and have become something of a hero.  Bothopportunities were, however, gone.  He must make the best of whatremained.\"Marian,\" he said, speaking slowly, quite calmly, and with no smallappearance of sincerity of purpose, \"I needn\\'t bring you any proof ofthis Légère woman\\'s bad character--the qualities of that characteryou yourself know--and as for this Morton girl, I can only fall backon what I have already pointed out to you.  You say she confesses herevil life: how can you, then, credit anything an admittedly abandonedcreature may have told you?\"\"Can\\'t the worst of women tell the truth sometimes?\"\"Practically never.\"\"But,\"--Marian passed a weary hand across her forehead--\"how couldthis girl be in a position to know what she says she knows, if shehadn\\'t led just the kind of life that you say makes her an inevitableliar?\"It was an excellent sort of answer.  Dyker tossed his head.\"I am hurt, Marian,\" he said.  \"I thought you had some faith in me; Ithought you knew me.  I don\\'t see how you can persist in thisattitude--how you can say these things.  Why, I have been in yourhouse: I have known you and your father; whereas thesepeople--Marian, I love you; why should I lie to you?\"She had been keeping her hand upon her forehead, but she lowered itnow to her eyes, where it was joined by its mate.\"I don\\'t know,\" she moaned.  \"That\\'s just it: I don\\'t know.\"\"Then what,\" he asked, \"can I do to convince you?  I won\\'t upbraidyou; I won\\'t be harsh.  My sane course would be to pay no attentionto accusations from such a character as this Mary Morton, and yoursane course would be to pay no attention to them.  But I know howthings are in this neighborhood; I know the bad atmosphere you havebeen breathing ever since you came down here.  Long ago I told youexactly what would happen; I foresaw it all.  I told you when youinsisted on going into this work that these women would poison yourmind, distort your vision, make you doubt all that is best in life.Apparently, they have succeeded; but I don\\'t speak of that.  Marian,unless it was in some police-court--perhaps at the time I saw RoseLégère--I never saw this girl in my life.  I don\\'t understand herenmity any better than you do.  It may spring from some imaginedwrong to one of her friends, or it may be a political plot.  But,except as it affects your regard for me, I don\\'t care anything aboutit.  All that I do care about, all that I do want to accomplish is torestore you to a normal view of things, get you out of these foulmental and material surroundings, and bring you back to your ownproper world.  I want to do this and to make you know the truthconcerning myself.  Tell me what will bring this about, and I\\'ll doit without a moment\\'s loss of time.\"He thought that, in the nature of the case, there was nothing verydifficult or inconvenient that she could demand; but he had countedtoo much on the artificial and too little upon the natural andprimitive woman.Her face still hidden, she felt the full force of his appeal, but thetempest had its wild will of her.  She believed him guilty; shebelieved him innocent.  She believed that, if he were guilty,temptation had come from the woman; she believed that, if he wereinnocent, there was nevertheless something--she did not knowwhat--that he was hiding from her.  Faith was ready to destroy much,but would not jealousy destroy more?  Her jealousy had consumeddignity, it had ravaged custom, it was burning restraint.Mary\\'s words had drawn in Marian\\'s mind a concrete picture, and thecontemplation of that picture had awakened an anger in which hergenuine love had for the first time genuinely expressed itself.Before, she could have heard with light regret of Dyker\\'s engagementto marry another woman.  Before, she might herself have drifted withhim through a placid wooing into the port of marriage that, untilthis revelation, she had in no wise understood.  But now she sawthings specifically, and in the element of the specific the qualitythat she had known as \"womanliness\" was dissolved and the thing thatshe at last knew to be Woman was evolved.The issue, she was thus still determined, depended upon proof ofinnocence.  He must be clean, and she must know it.She uncovered her fine face, strangely stronger for its grief.\"Wesley,\" she said, \"I do remember all that you told me these womenand this work would do to me.  If you prove to be wrong, I shall stayon here, and, of course, never see you again; but if you prove to beright I shall give it up, and then, Wesley, I shall marry you.\"He rose with a glad cry; but she, rising also, waved him back.\"Not yet,\" she said.  \"Either find Mary Morton and the proofs thatshe is dishonest--not only what I know she is, but dishonest in whatshe would say and do--show me this, or else----\"With straining resolution, he confronted her.\"Or else?\" he prompted.\"Or else bring her to me with her own denial and explanation.\"XXVDAUGHTERS OF ISHMAELWhen Mary left Rivington Street she faced the inevitable.  She hadseen the impossibility of domestic service; she knew nothing of anyother trade; she could not endure the shame of an institution, andher fortune consisted of just fourteen dollars and fifty cents.She walked, for a long time, aimlessly.  The night thickened and,block by block, the streets flashed into electric illumination, eachseparate flame glowing like a malevolent eye to show her misery.  Herstrength, never yet fully restored, failed her.  Her feet were tired,her knees bent irregularly, her head ached.  As at her first sight ofit, the city, which she knew scarcely better than on that springevening when she had been tossed into it, was a conscious prisonimplacably shutting her in forever.She walked westward, and then northward.  She dodged across FifthAvenue among the automobiles of careless, comfortable people on theirways to one place or another of swift enjoyment.  She passed anotorious café at the warm windows of which she saw, seated at ladentables and opposite leering men, the painted faces of softly gownedwomen, the more successful examples of what she soon must be.  Andshe came to hurrying Broadway through whose crowds she saw silentlyand cunningly darting, with smiling hate written on their tired,rouged lips, the girls whose dawn was the lighting of thestreet-lamps and from whom she wanted to ask for instruction in theone means of livelihood that remained to her.Her soul was as weakened and vitiated as her body, and by much thesame forces.  Into her escape from Rose\\'s, into her work at Mrs.Turner\\'s, into her appeal to the employment-agency and her tasks atMrs. Chamberlin\\'s she had put every particle of strength that shecould harness, and the result had always been failure.  The socialsystem was too mighty.  She could not prevail against it.  She mustdo its bidding, and since it was so impractically constituted as tobid her prey upon it, her sole solace must be found in preyingfiercely.She turned into a cross-street, full of refulgent drinking-placesthat beckoned by swinging doors, behind which were the voices ofsingers and through which passed, in alone and out with shame-facedmen, unending streams of women with white faces and vermillion mouthsand sadly encircled eyes.  But Mary pressed westward, though she didnot clearly know her intention until, having crossed two avenues, shefound that the cafés gave place to small shops, and that the shopswere giving place to tall, moldy buildings with long stairways beforethem, houses that had once, plainly, made homes, but that were now,as plainly, barracks for lodgers.From one of these she saw come a slight girl under a huge hat heavywith two great plumes.  Mary waited until this girl drew near, firsthesitated when she observed that the girl was scarcely fifteen, thenspoke when she noted the bedizened dress and the face of which thechildish beauty had been trained to maturity and hardness.\"Can you tell me if I can get a room around here?\" she inquired.The girl\\'s knowing eyes studied her.\"Hello!\" she said.  \"When did you hit the road?\"\"To-day.  I want to find a room.\"\"Well, you can\\'t go wrong.  The house I live in is full-up; but youcan ring \\'most any bell along here and get what you want.  Thereain\\'t no choice.  One\\'s as bum as another.\"She nodded saucily and went on her way, and Mary climbed the steps ofthe first house she came to.Her ring was answered by a woman that appeared, as far as Mary couldobserve in the faint light, to be about sixty years old.  Her hairwas gray and severely arranged; her dress was shabby, and she lookedvery tired.  To Mary she did not seem to be at all the type thatwould conduct the sort of place which the wanderer just then needed.\"Can you rent me a room?\" she nevertheless inquired.\"With privileges?\" asked the woman.It was a phrase new to its hearer, but she understood that itdescribed the kind of room she wanted.\"Yes,\" she almost whispered.But the woman did not lower her voice.  Her descent, as Maryafterwards learned, had been by slow stages, and her complaisance hadbeen enforced through a history that began with the establishment ofa respectable boarding-house, when a reform-election had driven herhusband from the police-force, passed through a widowhood imposedupon by absconding lodgers and raised house-rents, and ended by theadmission of first one and then many patrons that were, though theywanted what she had not always cared to give, at least certain to paywhat she had to turn over to the church-corporation that owned theproperty.\"I got a nice second-floor front, just a step from the bath-room, ateighteen dollars,\" she said.\"A month?\" inquired Mary.The woman regarded her as if she were somewhat of a curiosity.\"Certainly not: eighteen a week.\"\"Oh, I--I couldn\\'t afford that.\"\"It\\'s a nice room.\"\"Yes, I guess it is, but----\"\"I might let it to you for fifteen, to start with.\"\"I couldn\\'t afford it.\"\"Well, there\\'s the parlor.  It\\'s only twelve, an\\'ll be vacantto-morrow.\"\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to get a place for to-night.  Haven\\'t youanything cheaper?\"\"You don\\'t seem to know nothin\\' about prices, miss.\"  The landladyappeared to reflect.  \"But there\\'s the third-floor back hall-room,\"she added; \"I can let you have it for seven, an\\' better than that youcan\\'t do anywheres.\"Mary hesitated.\"You can easy make three times that much,\" the woman urged.\"Do you----\"  Mary wet her dry lips.  \"Do you think so?\"\"Think so?  Why, the lady that had that room for a whole year tilllast week made as high as twenty dollars a night.  She moved out o\\'here to her own flat.  But then, she was good-looking, of course.\"Mary had entertained some vague notion of a small gas-stove, and somesaving in the matter of meals; but this the landlady could in no wisepermit.\"The insurance sharks won\\'t allow it,\" she said, and concluded in atone that showed the later fact to be of more importance: \"Besides,it so runs up the gas-bills.\"Mary said no more.  She paid for a week in advance, and was shown atonce to the cell she had leased so dearly.It was a little, gaudily-papered room scarcely fifteen feet long andnot much more than two-thirds that in width.  A stationary washstandwas so placed that the door could not open freely.  At the singlenarrow window stood an unsteady table of no apparent purpose, andalong the side a clothes-press and a narrow, pine bureau.  The bed,however, was the chief feature of furniture, and that was large andcomfortable.\"I\\'ll give you clean sheets every Sunday morning regular,\" said thelandlady; \"but any changes you want between you\\'ll have to pay forthe washin\\' of.\"She demanded, and received, twenty-five cents for a latch-key, addedthat she permitted no noise in the rooms, and departed, leaving Marysitting on the edge of the bed.The girl\\'s experiences in the house of Rose Légère had prepared herbut imperfectly for this adventure.  It was a new business, and Marydid not know how to embark upon it.  She was as lost as thechorus-girl, unused to the purchase of railway tickets and theengaging of \"hotel-accommodations,\" who finds herself stranded in asmall town.She went to the bureau and looked at herself in its distortingmirror, in an effort to appraise her wares.  Her hollow cheeks neededrouge.  Her dull eyes needed belladonna.  Her clothes were worn.  Shefelt that she should start work immediately, but she was afraid.  Shewent to bed and slept.By the next evening she had spent all but a dollar and some few centsof the seven dollars and a quarter that had remained to her.  Withher bundles under her aching arm, she was returning to herlodging-house to prepare for work, when she stopped at the \"Ladies\\'Entrance\" of the corner-saloon and, going into a bare apartment for adrink of whiskey, found, seated at a table, as the only othercustomer, the girl of whom she had asked her questions on the nightbefore.The child smiled as pleasantly as her hardened face would permit.\"Hello, kid,\" she said.  \"How\\'s tricks?\"\"Hello,\" replied Mary.\"Sit down here,\" said the girl.Mary accepted her invitation, and gave the grinning waiter her order.\"Got settled?\" asked the girl, when the waiter had come and goneagain.\"Yes,\" replied Mary, \"I got a room.\"\"Where?\"\"The fifth door from here.\"The girl whistled.  She was proud of her knowledge.\"That old cat Charlotte Michaels!\" she commented.  \"I bet she stuckyou.\"\"She charges me seven dollars a week for a third-floor backhall-bedroom.\"\"Hell, that\\'s a steal.  Come next door to where I am, next week.There\\'ll be a better room there, then, for a dollar less.\"Mary looked at the child.  It seemed strange that she should be aboutto ask of one perhaps two years her junior for directions in the waysof the street; but she saw that the childishness before her waschildishness without innocence, was even lined and scarred by wisdom.She wondered about her own face.\"I\\'m goin\\' to start out to-night,\" she said.In the etiquette of this trade the workers ask no questions of oneanother and offer few biographies save those fictitious ones, thethreadbare, unimaginative lies, which they reserve for theirinquisitive purchasers.  Mary\\'s entertainer, therefore, put forwardno inquiries save one:\"New in this town?\" she asked.\"I\\'m new in the business,\" said Mary.The child eyed her doubtingly.\"Come off,\" she good-naturedly replied.\"Yes, I am.  I was in a house onc\\'t, but I\\'m new to this, an\\' I ain\\'tjust sure how to go about it.\"\"Oh,\" said the child, \"it\\'s dead easy to learn the curves, but it\\'sthe hardest job in the world.  Can\\'t your fellow put you wise?\"\"My fellow?\"\"Sure, your fellow, your friend, your sweetheart.  Honest, now; ain\\'tyou workin\\' for nobody?\"\"No.\"\"Well, you ought to be.  Most all the girls is.  You can\\'t get alongright without one.  Who\\'s goin\\' to go your bail when you\\'re pinched?\"\"Will I be pinched?\"\"About as often as onc\\'t a month, kid--unless you let the cop callonc\\'t a week.\"\"I guess I can stand him,\" said Mary.  She was past the stage ofobjections.\"You\\'ll have to pay him anyhow, you know.\"\"I thought I might have to.\"\"Then you thought dead right.  Why don\\'t you get a fellow?  They\\'slots of them.  They got political pulls.  Of course, they don\\'t leaveyou much money for yourself, but they certainly can fix things up foryou.\"\"Have you a fellow?\" asked Mary.\"I sure have,\" said the child, grandly.  \"My girl friend an\\' I havehad one between us ever since we left school last June.\"\"Does he treat you right?\"\"As good as any.  He beats us up once in a while when we don\\'t earnenough, or when he\\'s more than usual lit up.  But he keeps the copsaway, an\\' he gets us good trade, an\\' he\\'s true to the two of us.He\\'d ought to be; we make good money for him.\"Mary listened in a kind of awe.\"You like him?\" she asked.\"I love him,\" the child emphatically declared.  \"Lots of the girlshates their fellows, but daren\\'t leave \\'em because their fellows\\'dhave \\'em pinched right off--but I love mine.  You ought to get one.I\\'ll put you next.\"\"No,\" said Mary, \"I think I\\'ll wait; but I wish I knew the curves.\"\"Oh, hell; it\\'s dead easy, I tell you.\"  The child gulped her whiskeyand went on: \"You just put on your glad rags at eight o\\'clock an\\'walk Broadway from Twenty-third to Forty-second.  If you can hustle,you can land half a dozen before one o\\'clock.  When they give you theglad eye, take it, an\\' when they don\\'t, just you walk by \\'em sort ofhummin\\' under your breath.  Stop an\\' look in the store-windows, an\\'they\\'ll come like flies.  But always be sure to get your money first.Ask \\'em two dollars if they look that strong, or one if they\\'re cheapguys--but don\\'t ever take a cent less\\'n fifty cents.  I always getsthe two-plunk myself, unless a piker stands out for a dark corner orhallway and tries the quarter game: then I go through his clothes forall he\\'s got.\"Mary rose, with averted eyes.\"Thank you,\" she said.\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" said the child.  \"You just take my tip, an\\'you\\'ll make good.\"And, if by managing, by the most detestible sort of work, to keepclothes upon her back, food in her stomach and a roof over her head,was making good, Mary did it.  Everything fell out as the little girlhad described.  That night the adventurer, with no alternative, sankthe last of her scruples, and, when her room-rent next fell due, shepaid it and had a margin of several dollars to place in her stocking.There was not, she found, very much to be saved, for the whole worldseemed to mark her as legitimate prey.First, the policemen were quick to see that she was an unprotectednewcomer, and, one by one, to stop her and threaten her with arrest.In the beginning, she was afraid to slip them their tithes, and didit timidly and awkwardly; but, when she saw how jauntily andgraciously they accepted payment, she had the bills always ready atthe time when they were expected and, with the bills, the caressesthat, not infrequently, had to accompany them.Other expenses were proportionate.  Rent gained upon the advance ofprosperity.  Showy clothes, if not the best, were a necessity, andthe second-hand shops raised their prices on the suspicion of herprofession.  Rainy nights came, when there was almost no business tobe done.  The work was of a character that required sturdy food, andthis must be bought in restaurants tacitly conducted for her classand charging accordingly.  The men, she soon discovered, were asloath to buy her a supper as they were ready to buy her drinks, acondition the sole consolation of which was the fact that alcoholdulled whatever remained of the fine edge of sensibility.Some of her cursory Antonies, regarding their transactions as theyregarded their other business affairs, were honest, but most werehonest only when they had to be, and to them Mary and her kind werebeasts of burden not worthy of the stipulated hire.  There were thelechers that wanted only to waste the busy minutes in unremunerativetalk; there were the seekers that endeavored to secure throughhideous formulæ of affection what they were too mean frankly topurchase; there were the hypocritical male animals that, abovesuspicion in their daylight life, considered the women of the nightas fair game for cheating, and then there were the careful toads, whoprided themselves upon their shrewdness, and who bargained andhaggled as a man would be ashamed to bargain and haggle for a dog.It was a trade of hard hours, hard walking, and hard drinking, and,in the glaring cafés where she often sat with her fellow-workerswaiting to be smiled at by the hunters, Mary, though she met manygirls that fared worse than herself, met few that, when truthful,told of faring better.  The woman that quitted her landlady\\'s carefor \"a flat of her own\" represented the ideal toward which this wholearmy was hoping, but was an ideal mythical.Nearly all were working in health and out, and saving nothing.Nearly all were in bondage to taskmasters that slunk along after themthrough the streets, saw them strike a bargain, waited in the shadowsof a nearby house until the wage was paid, and then came forward,before the customer had turned the corner, to exact their tribute.Born, through the effects of a wasteful industrial system, in cellarsupon beds of rags, herded as children in attics where a family of tenslept in a space too small for five, bred in poverty, always underfedand never properly protected from the weather, some of them were usedto hardship that no decent social justice would ever have permitted.Others had been lured from comfortable homes.  Still others were thefaster fettered because they had gone from homes too respectable toallow of any return.  But almost everyone, through fear of exposure,dread of jail and reformatory, and awe of their owners\\' politicalinfluences, was the chattel of a slavery as thorough as that of whichMax Grossman was a minor instrument.The majority of these toilers were ready to receive, or had longsince received, the seeds of tuberculosis; few could continue theirwork for five years, and ninety-five per cent., as a drunken youngcollege undergraduate one evening cheerfully informed Mary, weresuffering from one or other, and sometimes from all three, of thetrio of diseases common to their business.  Out from those stuffybedrooms and those smoke-clouded, song-filled cafés, men carried thescourging social illnesses to innocent wives and to unborn childrendestined to dwarfed or sightless lives.  The sufferer might believehimself cured and bear infection years later.\"Now, take yourself, for instance,\" the lad had resumed, his cheeksstill rosy with youth, but his eyes aflame with liquor.  \"I knowsomething about these things; but I couldn\\'t tell whether you werefree or not.  You might be sick a long time before even you couldtell, and then you wouldn\\'t risk starvation by telling about it.  Youmight be sick right now for all I know.  But look out for the worstof all!\"Mary heard him with as little heed as she had heard most men.  Shehad learned all that he said from women who knew more of it than, shehoped, this boy would ever know, and she had been well assured thatit was a danger that no preventive could wholly defy and no care becertain to escape.After all, she used to reflect, nothing much mattered.  She hadnothing pleasant to look forward to and, therefore, she wiselyrefrained, save for one advancing idea, from looking forward.  Shehad no past that did not have its pain for her vision, and,therefore, with this sole exception, she resolutely kept her eyesupon the present day.Yet gradually one great passion was growing within her.  That processof thought which had begun in her encounter with Philip Beekman, whenshe left his mother\\'s employment, had been hastened in its growth bywhat Marian Lennox had said and failed to do, and the shock of thegirl\\'s embarkation upon her new profession had only momentarilyretarded it.  She was not large enough--few of us are--to see theconditions behind the individual, nor yet greatly to concern herselfwith individuals that did not directly concern her; but she sawclearly her own plight, and now saw, or thought she saw, that thisplight was due entirely to the machinations of the man who had takenher from her home and brought her to New York.  She could have lovedhim, and so she hated him; she could still feel a tenderness for whathe might have been, so she permitted herself to feel only animosityfor what he had proved himself to be.  To him she traced directly allthat had befallen her, and as she could not go beyond him, so fromhim, she slowly and finally resolved, she would exact payment.  Thatthought waxed in her tired mind; it was fed with every throe of herpained body until it dominated her circumscribed outlook upon theworld.  It even saved her from suffering, because it so possessed herthat it armored her against all lesser things.  She had found, atlast, a purpose in life.It was almost coincident with her realization of this that Maryrealized something else.  She went immediately to a physician.Dr. Helwig, a man with an enormous paunch and a round face and triplechin, was one of the many excellent practitioners that depend fortheir living--and it is a good one--upon the class to which Marybelonged.  He treated the matter for what it was: a commonplace inhis day\\'s work.  At the end of a week he confirmed her fears.For a moment she reeled under the blow.  The bookcases with theirponderous volumes in dark bindings, the shelves burdened with phials,the glass medicine-case, the convertible table for minor operations,the crowded desk, and even the fat physician before it, seemed towhirl in a mad saraband.\"Come, come!\" she heard the doctor say, as he thrust an uncorkedbottle of smelling-salts under her nose.\"How long will it last?\" she panted.\"We must keep up our treatment for six months or a year,\" heanswered.  \"Meantime, diet and quiet.  No liquor.  If you were amillionaire, I\\'d prescribe a long sea-voyage or a trip to HotSprings.\"Out of the chaos of her brain a sudden idea was shaping.\"What,\" she inquired, \"about other people catching this?\"He knew her business perfectly, and he knew that what he had to sayon this point would weigh but little in the scale against want.Nevertheless, he made the common answer.After that she listened to all the instructions that he gave her.More than ever now she had her purpose in life.XXVI\"THE LEAST OF THESE\"A week later, in a lamp-lighted street, Mary and Carrie met.  Eachgirl was too conscious of her own business to remark that it was thebusiness of her acquaintance, and each tried to avoid the other; butbefore recognition was complete they were face to face.  Silence wasconfession.  Mary spoke.\"Hello,\" she said, \"it\\'s a long time since I seen you.  How are you,anyways?\"Carrie, though still a homely girl, wore a close-fitting coat thatmade the best of her figure.  Her hat was wide and new and, as sheanswered, she turned from the light.\"Pretty well,\" she said, and paused short.\"I guess,\" said Mary, \"you thought it was queer, my never comin\\' tosee you; but I haven\\'t had a single chance.  I\\'ll come soon, honest Iwill.  How\\'s Katie?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" Carrie slowly answered, \"I\\'m not living with her anymore.\"\"You ain\\'t?  Since when ain\\'t you?\"\"Oh, I don\\'t know--a couple of weeks.\"\"You two didn\\'t scrap?\"\"No.  I had to go away.\"  And then, to divert the fire, Carrie added:\"Are you still working at that place the Settlement-people got foryou?\"\"No, I left that long ago.  Have you gone back to theshirtwaist-factory?\"\"I couldn\\'t: the strike was never settled, and, anyhow, they wouldn\\'thave taken me back if I\\'d been willing to go.\"Mary looked at the long coat and the gray hat.\"But, say,\" she began, \"you don\\'t look----\"Her eyes dropped to Carrie\\'s and, suddenly, she knew.  Her voicesoftened.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she said.  \"I had to do it, too.\"Silently they touched hands.  The Lithuanian\\'s breast rose and fellquickly.\"I couldn\\'t do anything else,\" said Carrie, but only in explanation,not in extenuation or excuse.  \"There was no other work I could do.\"\"I know,\" said Mary.\"And everywhere I went,\" continued Carrie, \"he followed me.  He wasalways just behind me when I walked, always just around the cornerwhen I stood still.  When I was dizzy and hungry, he always lookedwell fed and always had the money in his hand.  He waited, waited,waited.\"\"You mean your fellow?\" Mary asked.Carrie assented.  \"If you can call him that,\" she said.  \"He has twoor three others working for him, or he\\'d be across the street now.I\\'m different from them--freer.  I\\'m not afraid of him, and so he isa little afraid of me.\"Mary took the girl\\'s arm.\"They won\\'t let us stop this way on the pavement,\" she said.  \"Comein here and have a drink.\"They went into the women\\'s room of one of the quieter saloons.  Mary,mindful of the doctor\\'s directions, took only carbonated water, butCarrie ordered whiskey.Mary, with her stomach crying out for the alcohol, and, in thatwrenching desire, nearly seizing her companion\\'s liquor, sipped thewater.\"I\\'ve quit it,\" she averred.  \"It don\\'t pay.\"\"Most of the men make you take it,\" said Carrie.\"Yes,\" Mary admitted, \"but you can chuck it on the floor if you\\'refly.\"  She took another sip of the water, and then asked: \"Why don\\'tyou shake this man if you\\'re not scared of him.  You can come withme, you know.\"\"It wouldn\\'t be good business,\" Carrie declared.  \"I need somebodywith influence to look after me in case I\\'m arrested.\"Mary was silent for a minute, thinking.\"Perhaps you\\'re right,\" she granted; \"there\\'s one of \\'em I\\'d like tofind.\"\"Who is it?\"\"I\\'ll tell you sometime.--Look here: I don\\'t feel like workin\\'Broadway to-night, an\\' I\\'ve got some money.  Let\\'s do a dance-hall.\"They \"did\" several.  At the first a mask-ball was in progress; thebachanalian guests had rented extravagant costumes; confetti wastossed by the onlookers, and swiftly shifting lights of red and blue,of green and purple, played upon the dancers, whose whirling shadows,monstrously magnified, were thrown upon sheeted walls.  At another,there was an explosion of obscene epithets followed by a fight, whichmade retreat advisable; and at a third, the dances were so short andthe intervals provided for the solicitations of the waiters were solong that both girls wearied of the scene.On Tenth Avenue they at last found, however, a place more to theirliking.  It was the usual type of room, enlarged by tearing out thethin partitions that had once divided it into several tenements.  Thelights shone sick through the clouding smoke, and the air was heavywith the odors of dust, tobacco, alcohol, and sweat.  But the musicwas lively, the floor crowded, and the little tables along the wallswere surrounded by laughing groups of drinking men and women.  Of theformer, though most were hollow-chested, pale-cheeked, hawk-nosed,some showed clearly that they came to plunder; and if the majority ofthe latter were gum-chewing working-girls still in their earliestteens, many were of the variety to which the two newcomers nowbelonged.Mary and her companion sat down at a table near the door.  Theynodded to the burly, cigar-smoking \"Boss,\" who moved energeticallyabout, urging bloodless lads to find partners, and now and thenhimself taking a turn with a neglected girl.  They exchanged familiargreetings, though they had never before seen her, with thefalse-jeweled woman whose business it was to assist the boss instimulating the dancers by precept and example.  And they watched thescene with a gaze grave and calculating.Here a child of thirteen, with closed eyes and her peach-tinted cheekagainst her pimpled partner\\'s, undulated to the music, scarcelymoving her feet.  Nearby there whirled, like a dervish, a girl towhose consumptive face the revolutions brought a glow that mimickedhealth.  Now and then a woman would leap from one of the tables,embrace an unembarrassed man about the neck and so waltz off withhim, at once passionate and mocking, both of them deaf to theplaudits of their spectators.  From time to time the lights weresuddenly extinguished, and the dance went on in the darkness amid achorus of kisses, cries, and giggling.  Most of the boys and men, andnearly all of the little girls, were drunk.Among the dancers, doubtless plying his trade, Mary saw RafaelAngelelli, sleek and radiant in a new suit of pale buff.  He detectedher a little later and, disposing of a pure-faced child, who had beenin his arms, made a skillful way to his old acquaintance.  He shookMary\\'s reluctant hand and, nodding to Carrie as if she were afamiliar friend, sat down between the two women.\"Where you been?\" he affably inquired of Mary.\"Out of town,\" said Mary, coldly.Angel shrugged his shoulders.  He knew she lied, but he rarelycontradicted a lady.\"Meester Dyk\\' been lookin\\' all over theesa town for you, Violet,\" hesaid.Mary did not like the news.  She was still afraid that she might bewanted in connection with her contradictory affidavits.Angel, however, readily reassured her.  Just what Dyker wanted he didnot, he said, know; but he was certain that it was something for herbenefit.  The magistrate had commissioned him to find her, and Angelhad been searching, sporadically, for several weeks, even tracing hercourse back to the employment-agency and to that Mrs. Turner\\'s whereshe had first worked.\"Theesa woman say you steal,\" said the Italian.\"She\\'s a liar,\" answered Mary, hotly.\"She say she tol\\' you so.\"\"She tried to make out I took a cake of soap.\"\"But she say after you leave she meess two dollar an\\' some silkastockin\\'.\"\"That woman never wore no silk stockin\\'s in her life, an\\' therewasn\\'t two dollars in the house.\"Again the Italian shrugged his shoulders.  He gave Mary to understandthat, in his opinion, any woman who could steal and did not was afool, and that any woman who stole and acknowledged it was a worsefool.  But what, plainly, most interested him was the execution ofhis commission from Dyker.  He talked so earnestly about it that hefailed entirely to lay Mary\\'s fears.  She refused to give him heraddress, and as soon as he had left the table she endeavored to quitthe hall.The entrance of an acquaintance detained her.  There were words thathad to be said and drinks that had to be bought.  Half an hourpassed, and then, as she started with Carrie for the door, Mary sawWesley Dyker standing outside.  He was wrapped in a heavy overcoatwith its military collar turned up about his chin and his black derbypulled far over his eyes; but Mary feared him too much to fail ofrecognition.\"There he is!\" she whispered, catching her companion\\'s arm.  \"TheDago telephoned him.  I was afraid of that.\"Escape was hopeless.  She sent Carrie back to the dancers, and, goingout, met Dyker, her head erect.\"I heard you was lookin\\' for me,\" she said.Wesley raised his hat.\"Yes,\" he said dryly; \"walk a block or two with me.\"They went for some time in silence, Mary too much upon the defensiveto risk beginning a conversation, and Dyker trying in vain to commandthe anger that had been growing with every day since he had learnedhow she had betrayed him to Marian.  At the first dark street intowhich he turned her, his resentment burst its guard.\"What in hell do you mean by telling everybody all you know aboutme?\" he demanded.Mary shrank away.\"No, you don\\'t!\" he said, and seized her hand.  \"Didn\\'t I do you thebest turn that was ever done you?\"\"Yes,\" the woman quavered.  \"An\\' I wouldn\\'t pay you back the way yousay I done.  I never talked about you to nobody.\"\"Don\\'t lie.  You know you did.\"Mary remembered, but she shook her head determinedly.\"I\\'ve never once spoke your name,\" she said.\"I tell you to stop lying!\" rejoined Dyker.  \"You told it once at theSettlement on Rivington Street.  I know it.  I learned it theremyself.\"\"What did I tell?\" asked Mary.  Her tone was defiant, but herendeavor was to draw his fire.They walked forward.\"You said I hung out at Rose\\'s,\" he protested.  \"You said I was herlover and yours.\"\"I never said I had nothing to do with you, Mr. Dyker.  I don\\'t carewho told you I did; I never said no such thing.\"\"You said I went to Rose\\'s.  I know you did.\"She confessed to that, for she was truly sorry for it.\"But I didn\\'t mean to, Mr. Dyker,\" she added; \"honest, I didn\\'t.  Itjust slipped out.  I didn\\'t know Miss Marian knowed you.  Why, shetold me she didn\\'t know you, an\\' how\\'d I ever think she\\'d lie?\"That was a question which, ignorant of Miss Lennox\\'s precise methodof evasion, Wesley did not, even to himself, attempt to answer.\"It didn\\'t matter whether she knew me or not,\" he said; \"you had noright to tell it.\"\"I know that.  It just slipped out.  But it won\\'t never happen again.I wasn\\'t so wise as I am now.\"\"I hope not,\" he said, a trifle mollified by the sincerity in hertone.  \"But you\\'ve done me a big amount of harm there, Violet, andyou have got to undo it.\"Her first sensation had been one of relief in finding that her falseaffidavit was not held against her; her next had been fright at hisanger; but now she was all penitence for the ill she had wrought him.Dyker was the one man in New York that had done her a kindness, andshe held that kindness as the greatest possible.\"What do you want?\" she asked.  \"I\\'d do most anything for you, Mr.Dyker: you know that.\"They were under the uncertain light of a crossing.  He eyed hernarrowly, mistrustingly.\"I want you,\" he replied, \"to come to my office to-morrow evening atsix.  Here\\'s my card.  Will you do it?\"She took the card and thrust it through the opening of her shirtwaist.\"What do you want with me when you get me there?\" she wondered.\"I want you to come with me to Miss Lennox, and deny the story thatyou told her about me.\"Mary\\'s heart sank.  She could not bear the thought of facing Marian.\"What\\'s the use o\\' that?\" she pleaded.\"What\\'s the use?  Why, how else are you going to put me right withher?\"\"But I couldn\\'t.\"\"You must.\"\"I couldn\\'t, Mr. Dyker.  Honest, I couldn\\'t.  She\\'d know I was lyin\\'to her.\"\"You leave that to me.\"\"What excuse\\'d I give her?\"\"We\\'ll fix that up to-morrow.\"\"Please don\\'t make me do it, Mr. Dyker!\"\"I\\'ve got to.  What else can I do?--It\\'s all your own fault.  What\\'syour address?\"She gave it to him tremulously.\"All right,\" he said.  \"I\\'ll have a cab there for you to-morrow atfive-thirty.\"Her body shook with frightened sobs.\"Oh, Mr. Dyker,\" she repeated, \"please don\\'t make me do this!  I\\'d doanythin\\', \\'most, under the sun for you; but I can\\'t face MissMarian--honest to God, I can\\'t.\"What he should have done was to play upon her gratitude, but what hedid do was again to allow his mistrust and anger to have their rein.\"I won\\'t have any nonsense about this, Violet,\" he said.  \"If youdon\\'t come to my office to-morrow at six, I\\'ll have you arrested--andI\\'ll see to it that you won\\'t escape with a mere fine, either.\"\"It won\\'t----\"  She could not grasp it.  \"What do you mean?\" sheasked.\"I mean I\\'ll have you arrested on a big charge.\"Her lips stiffened with that common terror of the law, about the onlyterror that the law ever succeeds nowadays in creating: theunreasoning terror that seldom serves as a deterrent.\"I ain\\'t done nothin\\' but this,\" she said, in the full knowledge thatwhat she had or had not done would be no factor in the problem.\"You\\'ll find out about that when the time comes,\" he answered.  \"WhatI want to know is whether you\\'ll do me this favor or not.\"He had stopped and confronted her.  Even in the semi-darkness heranxious eyes managed to read his pale, determined face, but even inthe daylight they could have found there no relenting.She gave him a despairing smile.\"I guess I\\'ve got to,\" she said.\"Yes, you\\'ll have to.\"\"All right.\"\"You\\'ll do it?\"\"I\\'ll do it, all right.\"\"No bluff?\"\"No.\"\"Remember: if you don\\'t, I\\'ll fix you.\"Mary turned away.\"I\\'ll not forget,\" she said.\"If you don\\'t,\" he called after her, \"you won\\'t be sorry.\"\"I won\\'t forget,\" she repeated.And yet, even as she walked away from him, the sickness of indecisionwas upon her.  Like all narrow experiences, her narrow experiencemade her afraid of everything beyond its own limits.  Her habit oflife was the habit of the weakened bird of prey that attacks only thedefenseless and flies before the strong.  She had become a moralcoward, and the progress of her physical disease directly accentuatedthe insidious encroachments of her moral illness.  She could notopenly face Marian; she did not dare openly to defy Dyker.  Shewanted only to run away.By four o\\'clock the next afternoon she had run away.  The night hadbeen a wearisome journey backward and forward between the decision toobey the magistrate and the decision to evade him.  She thought thatshe owed him much, but she knew that she could not successfully faceMarian and lie.  She was tremblingly afraid of Wesley\\'s vengeance,but she was more afraid of Marian\\'s honest eyes.  All day she layupon her bed, dizzy from this circling process of thought, but atlast, in an attack of dread of the lie more severe than any that hadpreceded it, she flung her clothes into a little trunk, which she hadrecently purchased, and, calling a cab, drove to a new lodging-house.She did not go out that evening, but the next she had to go, and shehad not been on Broadway for two hours before a plain-clothes mantouched her arm.\"I\\'m sorry, kid,\" he said, \"but you\\'ve got to come along with me.\"Instinctively she recoiled, but the detective\\'s fingers had slippedto her wrist and tightened on it.  The sword had fallen.\"Where to?\" she asked.She knew the man.  She had given him money, and more than money, yetshe expected no mercy, expected nothing but an explanation.\"Jefferson Market,\" said her captor.  \"But if you\\'ve got anybodyhandy who\\'ll go your bail, I\\'ll take you to see him first, before wego down to Ninth Street.\"Mary shook her head.  Helpless horror had her for its own.\"No use,\" she answered.\"Are you sure?\" he asked.\"Certain sure,\" she said, and then, a little wistfully: \"I guessthere ain\\'t no good in tryin\\' to talk business to you?\"The detective was a big, black-mustached man.  His face was notunkindly, but he was helpless.\"No,\" he said; \"this here\\'s orders from the front.  If you haven\\'tgot some fellow to be ready with bail, I guess we\\'d better hurry up.\"They crossed to Sixth Avenue and walked down that noisy thoroughfareto the towering brick fortress that stands like a castle to guard thegateway of old Greenwich Village.By day that somber building seems to hide behind the grim planks ofthe elevated railroad; it is ugly, neglected, innocent; under itsprotecting wings are the stalls of white-aproned butchers and theopen establishments of green-grocers and hucksters plying theirseveral occupations.  But no sooner does the darkness drop itscurtain over the webbed streets, the dirty courts, and the foulalleys that surround the place, than Jefferson Market ceases to be abuilding for the dispensation of food and becomes a court for thedispensation of the commodity that we carelessly label Justice.  Thehands of the large clock in the high tower are hurried toward thehour of twelve; long rays of sinister light are shot from windowsnarrow and barred; and under a vaulted entrance-way there pours, fromyear\\'s end to year\\'s end, an unending army of those women of thestreet who have lost, for one reason or another, their ability anylonger to purchase the protection of the Law.It is not often that what the statutes designate as crime comes tothe Night Court: Crime may wait for the morning.  It is the drunkard,the vagrant, the licenseless pedlar, and, above all, unfriended MariaPeripatetica, the human being that humanity has spoiled in themaking, who is taken there.  Above all, the Marias Peripateticæ thathave, once fostered by the Law, quarreled with it, failed to bribeit, or openly rebelled against it.  Black and white, short-skirtedand gray-haired, besilked and bedraggled, from nine in the eveninguntil early morning, five thousand in a twelvemonth, they are broughtto the Jefferson Market Court for judgment from the power that hasmade them what they are.And judgment is what they receive.  The law is a mill that was madeto grind out one thing, and can grind no other; the courts wereconstituted to make criminals and to punish them, not to prevent orto cure; our present justice is not mercy; it is formulæ, notsentiment.  There is one woman that has some small authority in thistribunal, one woman that sees an occasional girl with some promise inher face and takes her away to Waverley House for observation and tobe given, if all goes well, a chance at other employment; butWaverley House is small, it is poor, and there is small chance forher that has been twice stricken.  One woman cannot do much againstthe grinding mill, and the grinding mill, between January andDecember, sends only seventeen girls to a semi-sane reformatory ascompared to three thousand that it sends to the university of crimewhich is known as \"The Island.\"Mary was hurried up a short flight of stone steps and into a smallhallway.  A metal gate was opened for her and snapped shut as shepassed it.  A stocky man took her name and address and got, from herconductor, in a voice that she could not hear, the charge on whichshe had been arrested, and then, after one turn to the left andanother to the right, she was shoved through a door and into abrightly-lighted, heavily-barred detention-pen.Dazedly, she looked about.  Beside her, upon one side, sat agray-haired woman of sixty, too old any longer to earn that tributewhich would have secured her immunity for the prosecution of thetrade she must recently have adopted.  Nearby was a girl of thirteen,who, temporarily neglected by her owner, had been arrested for thesame offense.  On the bench sat a fat negress who informed alllisteners that she was falsely charged with picking the pocket of abald-headed white man that she had solicited.  Over them all streamedthe pitiless light of strong lamps, upon them all were soon to feastthe eyes of the crowd in the near court-room.The newcomer bowed her head.  She did not know that a court-retainerhad been waiting her arrival.  She did not know that, as soon as shehad entered, this retainer had hurried to a telephone.  She did notknow that, in answer to this call, Rafael Angelelli had hurried tothe door that she had just passed, and there presented a note bearinga potent signature.  She did not even know that these things were ofcommon enough occurrence, and she was aware of only her misery untilshe heard the Italian\\'s low voice and saw him beckoning her to thebars.She almost ran toward him.  The other prisoners gathered about her,but the officer that accompanied Angel waved them away, and himselfdrew back.  Mary clutched the bars as if they had been a tangiblehope.\"Angel!\" she whispered.But Angelelli fronted her, scowling.  He shook a tight fist under hershrinking eyes.\"You are a dam\\' fool!\" he answered.Mary could not articulate.  Her lips involuntarily found an unthoughtquery, but her voice was dumb.\"Why you not leesten to theesa Wesley Dyk\\'?\" pursued Rafael.  \"Nowmaybe you go to the Island.  You know what that mean?  Theesa jailerscut off your hair, beat you up every mornin\\', every evenin\\' regular.No meals; only bread an\\' water; no wheeskey.  An\\' when you come outevery cop hava you\\' peecture an\\' you get arrest\\' each time an\\' sentaback again to jail!\"She believed him.  She would have believed anything that was said toher by someone she had previously known.  With a flow of ready tearsthat blinded her sunken eyes, she begged him to tell her of some wayof escape.Angel was ready with his answer.  It seemed that he still representedWesley Dyker and that Mr. Dyker was not disposed to be so hard on heras impartial justice demanded that he should be.  In the back-room ofa nearby saloon there were a lawyer and a notary in waiting.  If Marywould promise to swear to and sign before them a prepared paperdenying the accusations she had made to Marian, Angel would now, bymeans of a second note, see that the sitting magistrate did but fineher, and would hand her at once the amount of that fine.She had supposed that her arrest had been on the charge of larcenyfrom Mrs. Turner\\'s boarding-house; she had not known that she wasaccused of no more than the practice of her trade, and she couldscarcely credit news so good as this which Angel brought her.\"An\\' I won\\'t have to go to Miss Marian?\" she asked.\"No.  Meest\\' Dyk\\' want thees paper for hees girl--jus\\' to squareheemself witha hees girl--no more.  You go where you want.\"\"An\\' the judge\\'ll let me off?\"\"Right away.\"She promised, and a moment later was led into the court-room.She saw the gaping, leering crowd, which filled half of thatapartment beyond the low grating.  She saw the stolid policemenherding their charges as stockyard hands herd cattle for theslaughter.  She saw the stealthy slavers buzzing in and out, bentupon nefarious rescue; the waiting lawyers on the outer bench and thelaughing lawyers inside, joking together or making mirth before thedesk at which, in his black robe, sat the weary, cynical, indifferentmagistrate, his face as expressionless as that of a Chinese Joss.She heard, between the roars of elevated trains, the unintelligibleoaths, administered, as she now understood that the average oath isadministered, with a rapidity that robbed them of all dignity andmost effect; the drone of testimony constantly interrupted to thepoint of confusion and always curtailed to the exclusion of essentialtruth; the mechanical pronouncement of sentence that ended, as if thetwo things were on phrase, in the summoning of the succeeding case.All this she saw and heard and disregarded.  She had been struckdown, trapped, held fast in the grip of the invisible enemy that shethought of as the City.  She had been conscious of nothing but theliving Fear, and now, Angel had told her, some portion of relief wasat hand.Her arraignment, the payment of her fine, her meeting with thewaiting Italian, her progress to the nearby saloon where the lawyerand the notary were ready for her--all this passed like a vision ofthe night.  She signed without reading it--though she would not haveunderstood it if she had read it--the formal denial to which heraffirmation was immediately affixed.  She was too dazed to thinkuntil, leaving the three smiling men behind her, she had turned againinto free Sixth Avenue.It was then that she saw coming toward her a young man--a young manthat might have been anywhere from nineteen to thirty-two--with hairthat was dark and curly, sorely-shaven olive cheeks just showing thedefeated tokens of a blue-black beard; a dapper, prosperous youngman, with thick lips and hard eyes and a smartly cut overcoat, fromone pocket of which flashed a brilliant-bordered handkerchief.In the instant Mary\\'s exhaustion dropped from her brain andshoulders.  She forgot her fright of the earlier evening; sheremembered only the sufferings from which it had arisen.  Her waitinghad not, after all, been vain.  She was calm, she was resourceful,she was resolved.\"Hello, Max,\" she said.XXVIIJUDGMENTAt first he did not know her.  He stood there, while their eyes werelocked, in his own eyes no gleam of honest memory.  He wasunchanged--the serene, the secure, the smug Max Grossman of thatfirst meeting in the street of her little Pennsylvania town; but she,as she so well knew without this silent testimony, was not now, andnever again could be, the girl of that lost springtime.  He looked ather, his thick lips drawn thin in a professional grimace, and notuntil she spoke a second time did he recognize her.He started then, and his olive face went pale; but Mary put out herhand precisely as if she were meeting, after a brief absence, only anacquaintance of the everyday friendly sort, and Max, too glad forpardon to question motive, seized and squeezed her hand tenderly.\"Vhat?\" he cried in mock pleasure at this _contretemps_.  \"No, it_ain\\'d_!  I gan\\'t hardly belief mine eyes you\\'re lookin\\' so fine.But it _is_ Mary Denbigh!\"She smiled almost gayly.  In little she had to lie, but in much,though for a reason that he must not suspect, she was indeed exultant.\"I am lookin\\' good, ain\\'t I, Max?\" she said.He surveyed her cheap finery; saw her hair, disordered in her passagethrough the crowded court-room, and turned his gaze quickly from herhollow, painted cheeks, her hardening carmine mouth, and her heavilyringed eyes.\"You\\'re _grand_,\" he said.  \"I always knew you\\'d make good, Mary.\"\"You jollier!\" she laughed, and with her free hand, patted his olivecheek.\"No, it\\'s _hon_est, so help me.\"\"Then don\\'t you want to buy me a drink, Max?\"Grossman dropped her hand.  His face grew doubtful.\"I vish I had _dime_,\" he said, \"but I god to see a friend down theAvenue, an\\'----\"\"A lady, Max?\"\"Ach, no, Mary.\"\"Then let him go.  You ought to be glad to take a walk with asgood-lookin\\' a girl as you say I am.\"For another fleeting instant Max let his eyes rest on her face, thenlowered them.  He looked at the pavement and drew an awkward lineupon it with the edge of his tan boot-sole.  More significant thanany physical change in her was the fact that she could now embarrasshim.\"I know, Mary,\" he stammered; \"but, you see, this here feller vhat Itol\\'----\"She laughed again.  She thrust her arm through his and turned hisface uptown.\"Forget it!\" she said.  \"Don\\'t you worry, Max; I ain\\'t goin\\' to rakethings up, if that\\'s what\\'s souring you.  Life\\'s too short.  All Iwant is a talk and a drink.\"Half reluctantly, he let her lead him; but she could lead him andthat sufficed her.He lit an American cigarette and puffed it nervously.\"I\\'ve just been in there,\" she said, with a backward jerk of her headin the direction of the police-court.\"There?\"  Max was not surprised, but he added: \"Vhat vas you doin\\' inthere?\"\"What do you think?\" responded Mary.  She herself was thinkingrapidly--about other things.\"You vasn\\'t in drouble?\"\"I guess you would call it that.\"\"Pinched?\"\"Yes.\"He had asked her no questions about her past--but concerning herpresent he chanced a query.\"Mary,\" he inquired, \"do you mean they god you up fer your beesiness?\"\"That\\'s about it,\" she said.\"But vhy don\\'t you square you\\'self vith the goppers?\"\"I don\\'t know.  I--I was broke, Max.\"\"I vish I gould _help_ you, Mary,\" he said, his curiosity cooling atthe thought of an appeal for assistance.She saw it, and it amused her.\"Can\\'t you do it?\" she asked, dropping her voice into a whine.He tried to draw away from her, but her linked arm held himaffectionately fast.\"I been havin\\' rotten luck,\" he declared; \"somethin\\' awful.  I ain\\'tgot hardly only the money vhat\\'s in my _glothes_.\"\"Well, then,\" said Mary, looking at the clothes and knowing well thatthey somewhere concealed an ample yellow sum, \"why don\\'t you take meon your staff?\"\"Mary,\" he cried, trying to spread his hands, and failing dismallywith the one that her pinioning arm hampered, \"vhat do you think Iam?  A millionaire?  I ain\\'t got no staff.\"\"Come off!\" she bantered.\"I ain\\'t--honest.\"\"Still in the other line?\" she persisted.  \"I thought you might betrottin\\' \\'em on the street--they say there\\'s more in it.  Why do youstick to supplyin\\' the flats and the houses?\"Her voice was the perfection of good nature, but he writhed under it.\"Mary!\" he pleaded.\"Well,\" she said, disregarding his tone, and keeping his arm fast inher own, \"you do supply \\'em, don\\'t you?  I know one fellow who makeshis livin\\' goin\\' the rounds, findin\\' what girls is sore on theirmadams an\\' then gettin\\' a commission by sneakin\\' \\'em out an\\' changin\\'\\'em to new flats.  He lets on he\\'s sellin\\' kimonas, but one sample\\'slasted him three years.\"\"Mary!\" repeated Max, more weakly.\"That\\'s the truth,\" she said, and then: \"But can\\'t you startstreet-work an\\' take me on your staff?\"Again he looked at her,\"No,\" he answered.\"Not young enough lookin\\' now, eh?\"  She was still smiling.\"Ach,\" he protested, \"you oughtn\\'t nod to be so _hard_ on a feller.If you chust knowed----\"But she had gone far enough, and she would not let him finish.  Theyhad reached a saloon near to her new lodging-place, and she paused.There was, and she knew it, no word in his excuse that she would havecredited.  Nor did she mean, just yet, to let him see her hatred.  Inorder that he might the better see it at a later moment, she wantednow to quiet his naturally ready fears.  She had found that she couldharass him, and that, for the present, was all that she needed toknow.\"Never mind,\" she said, \"I told you I wasn\\'t goin\\' to rake upnothin\\', an\\' I mean to keep my word.  Come on in here.  This is aquiet place.  You\\'re goin\\' to buy me a drink, anyhow, just to showthat we\\'re still friends.\"He brightened at this indicated avenue of escape.\"_Sure_ we\\'re still friends,\" he declared, \"an\\' you can haf all youvant to _drink_, too.\"She slipped her hand into his--she could do it, she had learned,without the dumb flesh seeming to shrink from that contact--andpressed it.They went into the deserted \"ladies\\' room\" of the saloon to which shehad referred, and sat down there, facing each other under a lightturned kindly low.\"Vhiskey?\" asked Max.\"Yes,\" said Mary.\"Two of \\'em,\" ordered Max of the waiter that had answered his ring,\"an\\' don\\'d make \\'em so _stingy_ like most you fellers ofer this vay.\"The man brought the liquor, placed it before them, and went away.\"Vell,\" said Max, raising his glass, smiling his thin smile, andapparently forgetting that he had ever denied whiskey; \"here ve are,_ain\\'t_ it?\"If Mary was remembering another night and another drink she did notsay so; instead, as Max tilted his sleek head far back between hisshoulders and dropped the whiskey down his throat, her hand watchedfor the instant when his gray eyes were on the ceiling and thatinstant poured the liquor from her own glass to the floor.  When hercompanion\\'s head came forward her fingers, wrapped about the glass,were just withdrawing it from her lips.\"I can drink that better\\'n I used to,\" she said.Max grinned again.  So long as she did not upbraid him for his partin it, so long as she did not go into the details of its earlierstages, he had no objection to hearing of her past, was evenlanguidly curious about it, and was certainly sorry that it had notbrought her to more seeming prosperity.\"You sure didn\\'t take that like you vasn\\'t _used_ vith it,\" he said.\"I\\'ll take another just to show you how,\" she answered, and pressedthe nearest button.This time his eyes were on her and she had to drink.  But she did notscruple: so long as she retained her head and Max lost his, theeffect of the alcohol on her system concerned her but little.They had a third drink, for \"old time\\'s sake,\" as Mary suggested, andthis she succeeded in pouring down her dress-front.  At the fourth,Max began to show signs of fear that he would have a drunken woman onhis hands, but Mary\\'s patent sobriety soon reassured him, andovercame his protests against a fifth by recalling his promise ofliberality.His cold eyes sparkled into a faint light.  Little spots of redappeared in the olive of his cheeks.  He felt the advance of theenemy in his veins and tried to go; but Mary began an imaginativenarrative of her recent experiences and insisted on his listening.When he at last successfully interrupted that, she twitted him withbeing able to drink less than his pupils, and Max was once moreforced to order.  He was not drunk, or nearly drunk, but the fineedge of his discretion was dulled: he saw in the woman, who had nowmoved to his side, nothing that, whatever motives might be at work,could possibly harm him; he found something ludicrous in thesituation.  Her looks seemed better than they had appeared an hourearlier, and her tentative advances flattered him.Mary, though she had drunk more than was good for her, had managed tospill enough liquor to retain all the sobriety she needed; but, whenthey at last rose, she swayed a little unsteadily.\"Now,\" she said, \"you\\'ll just buy me a half-pint for my head in themornin\\', an\\' then you\\'ll walk as far as my door.\"Still enjoying the piquancy of the affair, he obeyed her.  He evenconsented to come to her hall-bedroom with her--a room the exactreproduction of that which she had formerly rented fartheruptown--and there, forgetful of the provision against the morning,they finished the half-pint.At last he stood up from the bed on which he had been sitting whileshe, opposite, used the single chair.\"Vell,\" he said, grinning; \"it\\'s been good to see you again, undmaybe I\\'ll gome back some efenin\\'.\"She rose before him.  The light was at her back and her face resumed,as she stood there, some furtive traces of its earlier grace.  Theeyes seemed to soften, the cheeks were a natural pink beneath theircoating of rouge, and her russet hair, curling about her face,relieved the harder outlines and cast a gentle shadow around theneck.  She spread out her arms.\"Kiss me,\" she said.He smiled and leaned condescendingly toward her.\"What\\'s your hurry?\" she murmured.He looked at her, and the weak light and the strong liquor stood herin good stead.\"I ain\\'t in no hurry,\" he smiled.She met him smile for smile--and then, in a sudden sense of triumph,she flung back her head and laughed.It was not until three hours later that he finally left her, but heleft hurriedly, for the remorseless gray light of morning was comingin at the window, and it fell upon her as she wrapped a soiled pinkkimona around her shivering figure and slipped her feet into a pairof rundown Turkish slippers.\"Good-by,\" he said, looking away from her.\"Wait a minute,\" said Mary.  \"I\\'ll go with you to the door.\"She did go.  She followed him down the dark stairway, creakingnoisily under their shamed feet, and she stood for a moment in theblack hall, holding the brass knob of the door, as he passed to thestep outside.  Mary slipped the dead-latch, ready to bolt the door.\"Max,\" she said.He turned quickly, nearly knocking over, as he did so, themilk-bottles that were lined, in a white row, upon the step.\"Yes?\" he returned, and grinned sheepishly.She thrust out her towsled head and looked up and down the graymorning street.  The block was empty.  She drew her head clear of thedoor.  She was still trembling, but from neither cold nor fear.\"You ain\\'t goin\\' without kissin\\' me?\" she asked.But a reaction of disgust had seized him.\"Yes, I am,\" he said.Mary\\'s one hand tightened on the knob; the other flattened itselfagainst the nearest panel of the door, ready to push hard.\"All right,\" she replied, with a sudden change in her voice that,still low, became tense and metallic.  \"You think I\\'m--I\\'m done for,Max.  Well--_you\\'re done for, too!_\"The man\\'s jaw dropped.  His olive face was ashen.  His eyes stared.\"What do you mean?\" he asked.Mary\\'s mouth was wreathed in a smile.\"You know,\" she answered.Max retreated so suddenly that he nearly fell down the stone steps.\"You\\'ve--you\\'ve----\" he gasped.\"Yes,\" said Mary.\"It\\'s a lie!  You\\'re tryin\\' to scare me!\"  His jaw workedspasmodically.  \"It\\'s a damned lie!\" he repeated.\"You don\\'t believe me?\" the girl inquired.If she had looked for heroics, if she had feared melodrama, she wasas yet disappointed.  The knees of Max shook under him; he was inabject terror.\"It\\'s a lie,\" he muttered over and over.  \"It\\'s a damn\\' lie!\"\"Think what you please,\" said Mary.  She was still smiling, stillserene.  \"You believed I\\'d forgot, didn\\'t you?  Well, I didn\\'tforget, Max Grossman, an\\' now you\\'ll remember.  If you don\\'t yetthink I\\'m givin\\' you a straight story, all you have to do is just onething: _wait_.\"Max uttered an inarticulate cry and threw himself at her, but he onlybashed his head against the closed door.Mary had shut it, and in time.  Behind it, in the dark hallway, shelay half fainting.\"It\\'s the last of you, Max,\" she laughed.And it was.XXVIIIHUSKS OF THE SWINEMary was too ill to go to work that night, and on the night followingshe was no better.  The shock, the spasm of success, the recoil, notmoral but physical, after the satisfaction of a supreme desire--thesethings were, of themselves, enough to leave her prostrate.  But, inaddition to these, she had, while standing at that open door,contracted one of those heavy colds to which she was now renderedespecially susceptible.  Through long hours of the day and thedarkness she tossed among the hot sheets of her bed, sometimes withher teeth clicking in a chill, again with her body burning in afever, but always revolving in her seething brain the details of thevengeance that she had wrought.Her physical sufferings mattered little to her.  There were hourswhen she was wholly incapable of feeling them.  When the inertia ofthe state of reaction began at last to wear away, it left her with aglow of recollection so great that there seemed no place for lessersensation.  She had accomplished her great work, she had achieved hermission.  What she had done had been done solely for her own heart\\'ssake; there had been no delusion of a celestial command, no distortedthought of a social duty; yet, the impulse, however utilitarian, hadbeen supreme, and its end filled her with a sense of triumph that,for want of the proper title, she was sure was happiness.A wiser head and an unwounded heart would have known enough of lifeto see that even Max Grossman was not entirely to blame.  A betterbrain could have looked back into the past.  It could have seen Maxas the type of all his kind, the symbol of every one of the greatcompany of slavers, the inevitable result of a system blind both toits own interests and to the interests of the race.  It could haveseen the child, one of half a dozen born to a woman that could not,properly, have cared for three.  It could have seen that childneglected, dirty, forgotten, locked, by day, in the bedroom where thewhole family tried vainly to sleep by night, learning the highestfacts of life from the worst of teachers: the cramped childishbrain--and going out, at last, upon the street, with passionsprematurely developed and perverted.  It could have seen the socialorder shape that child into society\\'s enemy: the starvedboy-pickpocket sent to the monstrously misnamed \"reformatory\"; thesame child branded as a criminal, with none to shelter or to trusthim, and with a knowledge, gained in the state\\'s own institution,which fitted him to be only a crafty gorilla to harass the state.  Itcould have seen the fatal line of least resistance as clearly in theresultant man as it is seen in the life of him that does no more thanwreck a bank or steal a corporation, and, hideous as its course is inthe one instance, it would have seen that the line was the same inall.But Mary never doubted her justice, and never regretted it.  One onlythought troubled her: she was afraid that, by telling Max, she mighthave given him a warning sufficiently early to defeat her ownultimate purpose.  It was a large part of her plan that he shouldknow whose hand had struck him, and, for a man in his business, theonly way in which she could make that knowledge certain was the waythat she had followed.  Yet what if he were in time to profit by herinformation?  What if, even were he too late, he should guard anddoctor himself with proper caution?  She turned the questions overand over in her mind, but she had always to end in the faith that theworst had happened.Sometimes, in the moments of exhaustion from the mad round of theseinquiries, she reverted for relief to matters that touched her lessnearly, and endeavored to occupy herself with the affairs of others.She thought of Dyker, and without resentment.  She knew that he woulduse her written retraction to regain Marian\\'s confidence, and shehoped that he would be successful.  Again she fell to speculatingupon the fate of Carrie Berkowicz and to wondering what had become ofKatie.  But upon her own past and present she did not permit herselfto dwell, and always, with the certainty of a machine, her brainrecurred to Max and her vengeance on him.On the third evening, however, her landlady, entering with supper,reminded her, without mincing matters, that the rent was due, andMary recalled that her little stock of money was exhausted.\"Can you wait till to-morrow morning, Mrs. Foote?\" she asked.Mrs. Foote was an ample woman, with round cheeks and robust frame,whose only dissipations were an over-indulgence in ritualism, babies,and the hospital.  She had a high-church cleric to whom she confessedthe sins of her neighbors; a wraithlike husband whose sole occupationappeared to be that indispensable to the regular increase of herfamily--and whom she would otherwise have failed altogether totolerate--and such a passion for being ill that she could never quitebelieve in the illnesses of others.\"I can wait just that long, Miss Morton,\" she said; \"but I\\'msufferin\\' so from rheumatism in my fingers that I just know my oldgastric trouble is comin\\' on ag\\'in, an\\' that\\'ll mean another of themhospital-bills.\"Mary raised her aching head.\"You won\\'t have to wait any longer,\" she answered.\"I\\'m glad of it, Miss Morton,\" responded Mrs. Foote, \"for there was ayoung lady lookin\\' at this room to-day an\\' she offered me a dollarmore a week for it, an\\' I wouldn\\'t like to lose you.\"\"You won\\'t lose me,\" said Mary, to whom even sustained conversationwas physical pain.  \"I\\'m goin\\' out to-night, an\\' I\\'ll have plenty foryou by the mornin\\'.\"\"You\\'re sure?\" asked the landlady.\"Of course I am.  It\\'d be a pity if I couldn\\'t earn that much.\"Mrs. Foote looked at Mary\\'s face and seemed to doubt the foundationfor her assurance.\"Well,\" she sighed, \"I certainly hope you can.\"For some minutes after the door closed, Mary lay still.  She hadagain been brought face to face with the most poignant of tragedies,the tragedy of living.An hour earlier, had she questioned herself, she would have said thatshe was careless of life, that neither this earth nor the quitting ofit interested her, that continued existence was a matter ofindifference.  Then she was in that state of exultation above thingsmundane which is produced only by great sorrow, great joy, or thegreat revenges that are both grief and triumph.  But now the words ofthe landlady had brought her back from the indulgence ofcontemplation to the necessity of action.  Mary\\'s insidious,implacable disease had completed what her business had begun, andwhat her business alone would have completed far more slowly.  Thefew emotions that she was now capable of feeling were the moreintense because of their rarity, but their intensity was equaled bytheir brevity and, when the moment had gone, it left her even more ofa moral weakling than it had found her.She knew Mrs. Foote and her tribe too well to deceive herself as towhat must happen should the morning dawn upon an empty stocking.Life held nothing for which Mary greatly cared, but the instant ofdeath contained all of which she was afraid.  She did not greatlywant to harm others by plying her trade in her present condition, butshe could not think of others.  Each step would be a separate woundto her tortured body and her throbbing head, but she understood thatthe landlady had to wring out the rents by the means that conditionshad forced upon her; and so the worst of fears, the fear of poverty,which is the fear of death, took this sick woman from her bed,dressed her in her best frock, and sent her out into the street.Along Sixth Avenue, where fortune had often, theretofore, been kindto her, she met no significant glances.  A passing girl or two,having missed her for the last few evenings, proffered a casualsympathy; but that was all.  Through the open doors of the Haymarket,she turned in, but there even the women at first disregarded her.Several men that she recognized in the boxes of the gallery aroundthe little hall nodded, but immediately looked away.  The one manthat she happened to know better than any of the others did notappear at all to remember her, and his neighbor, who had frequentlyaccompanied her, signaled elsewhere.She was lonely.  She approached two women who were circling thefloor, arm in arm.  She addressed them with the familiarity of thecraft.\"Hello,\" she said.The one woman smiled, but her companion, a formidable, tailor-madepersonage, swelled with dignity.\"You better beat it,\" she declared.Mary flushed.\"What\\'s eatin\\' you?\" she demanded.\"You don\\'t belong here,\" the woman answered.  She made a lofty surveyof Mary\\'s finery, and then added: \"Goin\\'?\"Mary\\'s heart sickened, but she stood her ground.\"No,\" she said, \"I ain\\'t.\"The floor-manager was passing.  The social arbiter turned to him.\"Will,\" she asked, and her shrill voice seemed to carry over all theroom; \"what\\'s this place comin\\' to?  Throw that Fourteenth Streetwoman out o\\' here!\"This was enough.  Mary left the place, and, still aching in everylimb, turned through a narrow cross-street to Broadway.  Her eyesswam as she lingered before shop-windows in the hope that someone shepassed would accost her.  Her throat was dry and it hurt her when shehummed into the ears of careless pedestrians.  Nobody seemed to heedher.  The night was cold, and she shook like a recovering drunkard.She mastered all her strength to speak plainly to a complacent man ina great ulster.\"Hello!\" she said, trying to smile.  \"What\\'s your hurry?\"The man looked at her and swore.\"You must think I\\'m blind,\" he ended.She knew that she looked ill, but she knew that she must find money.She pleaded with age, because she knew it to be æstheticallytolerant; she ogled youth, because she knew it to be inexperienced;and she stationed herself at last near a saloon in a poorly lightedquarter, because she concluded that the men leaving such places werethe only men to whom she was just then fitted successfully to appeal.It was one o\\'clock in the morning before she could induce even one ofthese to give way to her, and he, staggering with drink so that shehad to support him with all her ebbing powers, insisted on stoppingin an alleyway when, for the first time, she picked a pocket.  Adollar and a half was all that she had as she left him, and the nextdark figure that she stopped--she did not look at his face or carewhat sort of face it was--answered her with sharp laughter.\"A two-spot?\" he cackled.  \"You have a few more thinks comin\\', oldgirl!\"\"A dollar?\" suggested Mary, tremulously.\"I got just a half--an\\' you ain\\'t worth a cent more.\"She took it--what would she not have taken?--and she worked on intothe dawn, on with a mounting fever and a sick determination, knowingnow that her chances grew with the approach of morning and findingherself, when at last the morning came, with scarcely a dollar beyondthe sum due for rent.During all the months that followed she skirted the dire edge ofstarvation, more than half the time too ill to rise from her bed andaware that she was at no moment fit to rise.  As her cold grewsteadily better her deeper illness steadily increased.  It thrived onevery exertion and seemed to gain each atom of strength that shelost.  Things might thus continue for almost any period, but she knewthat her manner of life forbade absolute cure, and that, at the end,there waited a slow and loathsome death.  Anticipation made herfaint; the melancholia and terror, which are symptomatic, sometimesnearly maddened her.  The last vestiges of the moral sense, so earlyinjured by previous experience, were almost wholly destroyed; therewas no social consciousness; the appeal of the individual wideneduntil it occupied her entire horizon; there was room for nothing butthe craven passion for life.Fat Dr. Helwig, when she went to see him, blinked at her out of hisdeep-set eyes, and told her that she was not taking sufficient rest.Mary twisted her helpless hands.\"How can I afford to take it?\" she asked.\"Save your money,\" said he, patting her thin shoulders, and chucklingprosperously.  \"You girls never put aside a cent.\"\"We don\\'t earn enough.\"\"Poof!  That\\'s what you all say.  I know--I know.  We men aren\\'t suchfools as you take us for.\"But Mary, as each evening she made up before her little mirror, notedthe gradual depreciation of her wares; each week she found it harderto pay rent and retain enough money for food.  Mrs. Foote seemed tocome every day, instead of every seventh, and yet each night businessgrew more difficult.  Whenever Mary missed a few evenings, orwhenever she changed her hunting-grounds, the police needed freshpayments.  She surrendered one uptown cross-street after another.  Atlast she deserted Broadway and patrolled only that Fourteenth Streetwhich the woman at the Haymarket had so scornfully referred to andwhich had so wonderfully burst upon Mary\\'s sight when she firststepped from the Hudson Tunnel upon the surface of Manhattan.Spring, summer, and autumn passed, and a lean winter followed them.Mary caught another cold and was ill for a week.  She went to worktoo soon and had to go back to bed for several days and remain idlefor several nights.  At last, with the ancient fear of the whiterace--the fear of that poverty which is death--gnawing at her vitals,she struggled to her feet and tramped once more along FourteenthStreet from Sixth Avenue to Third.But now the sword descended.  Even the Fourteenth Street saloon bestknown for her purposes gave no fish to her net, and Eighth Street waslittle better.  She was too tired to go farther; she had, the nextmorning, to offer Mrs. Foote only a third of what was due.The landlady, whose bulk seemed to crowd the hall-bedroom, leanedheavily against its frail door.  Mary thought the woman\\'s slow, browneyes more than commonly suspicious and her round face implacablyhard.  The tenant, with all explanation frozen upon her lips, handedover the clinking bits of money.  They fell into the big, extendedpalm as a few drops of water might fall into a basin.  Mrs. Footebegan slowly to count the coins.Mary watched, in fascinated silence, the counting of those few piecesof silver, each one of which seemed stained with her blood.  She sawthe landlady\\'s expression change to one of incredulity.  She saw thecounting repeated.Mrs. Foote again thrust out her grimy fingers.\"What\\'s this?\" she demanded.\"It\\'s----\"  Mary looked at the floor.  \"It\\'s the rent,\" sheconcluded, in a whisper.\"_What\\'s_ the rent?\"\"That\\'s all I have--just now.  I thought--I thought, considerin\\' howlong I\\'ve been here, you might wait a day for the rest, Mrs. Foote.\"The landlady opened her hand, and Mary\\'s little store of coin droppedto the bed.\"I can\\'t take this,\" she said.\"You mean,\" asked Mary, with a quick gasp of hope, \"that you\\'ll letme keep it till I get the rest?\"\"No, I don\\'t mean nothin\\' of the sort,\" said Mrs. Foote.  \"I meanI\\'ve got to have the whole bill--right now.\"Mary\\'s heart sank.\"That\\'s all I have,\" she said.She had sunk to a seat on the tumbled bed, beside her scatteredcoins.  Her thin hands were locked across her knees; the dirty pinkkimona slipped lower from her shoulders at every frequent cough, andher eyes sought those of Mrs. Foote in dumb appeal.  Her russet hairfell dully disordered about her hollow cheeks, and the rouge on herlips was purple.\"I\\'m sorry,\" pursued Mrs. Foote, who was too used to such incidentsgreatly to concern herself; \"but I\\'ve got to make my living likeanybody else does.\"\"I was expectin\\' some money this evenin\\',\" said Mary.\"Hump!\" sniffed the landlady.\"You don\\'t believe that?\"\"I don\\'t care, Miss Morton; I can\\'t care.\"\"But I\"--Mary\\'s fingers knotted tighter about her knees--\"I waspromised it,\" she lied, \"an\\' I\\'m dead sure to get it then.\"\"I\\'ve heard that so many times,\" said Mrs. Foote, \"that I knowed itby heart three year\\' ago.\"\"I could pawn somethin\\',\" suggested Mary.The landlady swept the bare room with a critical glance.\"What?\" she asked.There was no adequate answer to be made.  Mary had tried to pledgeher coat a few days before, and had been offered only an inadequatetwenty-five cents for it.\"Then you won\\'t--you can\\'t wait?\"\"No, I can\\'t.  I\\'m a sick woman myself; my rent\\'s due, Miss Mary, an\\'the honest truth is that there\\'s such a lot of women wantin\\' roomsthat I\\'d only be doin\\' a injustice to my children not to take in alady that could pay prompt--for a while.\"Mary said nothing more.  She packed her few belongings into hertrunk, left it in the hall to be called for, and, as the chillevening fell, went away from the house with no idea where she was tofind a lodging for the night.  For an hour, though she was stillweak, and the time was as yet so early, she walked up Broadway and,in the Forties, turned eastward for a few blocks, and so south again.Not far from the Grand Central Station she saw a little crowdgathered at a corner, and she stopped, rather for the luxury ofstanding still than from any curiosity.The place was a church.  Colored lights streamed from its richstained-glass windows.  Through its swinging doors there stole thescent of flowers and the sound of delicate music.  A long row ofcarriages, the coachmen walking up and down to keep warm, stretchedfar around the corner.Mary, shivering, worked her way quietly through the group of men andwomen on the sidewalk.  In order to avoid a particularly entangledportion of the press, she started to walk along the steps by thetower-entrance, and then, seeing a side-door open, she listlesslyturned toward it and looked in.Far away up the vaulted nave the altar stood, white with damask andyellow with candles.  The chancel was a garden, the whole buildingheavy with scent.  Acolytes in scarlet were grouped about the robedpriests.  The choir had risen and, preceded by a lad that bore alofta great brass cross, were forming into a singing procession, whichslowly filed down the center aisle.With a subdued scuffle and swish, the congregation also rose as thedouble line of choristers moved between them.  Women craned theirnecks and men, pretending to look stolidly ahead of them, lookedreally out of the corners of their eyes.  The choir, at the maindoor, divided and stood still.  High overhead a deep-toned organ wasplaying the wedding-march from Lohengrin, and through the respectfulline of white-clad boys there moved a man of regular features withlowered lids that hid his eyes, and a crisp brown mustache, whichconcealed his lips, and, on his arm, in the costume of a bride, atall, graceful, pure woman, whose face was like a Greek cameo and inwhose hand was a huge bunch of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley.The fingers of a policeman touched Mary\\'s arm.\"You\\'ll have to get back,\" he said.  \"The people\\'ll be comin\\' out ina minute.\"But Mary did not wish to move.\"I\\'ve got a right here,\" she answered.\"You?\" The policeman looked at her, and then laughed.  \"What right?\"he asked.\"Isn\\'t that Miss Lennox?\"\"It was.\"\"And Judge Dyker?\"\"Sure.\"\"Well, I gave him his marriage-license.\"The policeman\\'s good-nature was amused, but he forced her back to thestreet.\"No use,\" he said.\"An\\' I guess,\" said Mary bitterly--\"I guess I paid for the bride\\'sbouquet.\"He did not reply, nor would she have heard him had he spoken, for inthe stream of lesser guests now flowing from the rear of the church,which had been assigned to them, she was met by Katie Flanagan.Not the piquant Katie of that photograph which used to adorn thebureau in the shabby tenement of bachelor Hermann Hoffmann, or thesaucy girl of the second-hand clothing-store, or yet the frightenedclerk that had at first evaded and at last defied the whiskered Mr.Porter.  Those days were patently passed; Katie, like many anotherstrong soul, had faced temptation and conquered it; and in the steadof the old days had come new days that brought a maturity and adignity with which Katie was consciously satisfied.  Her blue eyeswere as glad as Mary remembered them, but their happiness was calm;her black hair was gathered in a formal knot, and her gown, though abetter gown than that she used to wear, was of a simplicity almostsevere.Nevertheless, when she saw Mary, who sought evasion, Katie camefrankly forward with outstretched hand.  She recognized with regret,the change in her former acquaintance, but, knowing, as she must haveknown, its cause, she decided to ask no questions concerning it, and,if she offered no assistance, she at least proffered no advice.\"I just come to see the last o\\' Miss Marian,\" she explained.  \"Nearthe half of old Rivington Street\\'s been tucked in here among th\\'swells to give the good word to her--Jews an\\' Irish--an\\' if therabbis won\\'t mind for the sheenies to come to such a heathen church,I thought Father Kelly might manage to forgive me.\"Mary\\'s brain was just then too dull to make any but a commonplaceanswer.\"You\\'re lookin\\' well,\" she said.\"I ought to be, though there\\'s a youngster expected.  I tellHermann--we was married a few weeks after last election--I don\\'t knowhow we\\'ll keep a family; but he just whistles an\\' says we\\'ll make outsome way, an\\' I guess we will.\"\"I\\'m glad,\" said Mary, \"that you\\'re married.\"\"Well, so am I--most of the time.  Of course, the man has some queerideas, but I\\'m doin\\' me best, with Father Kelly\\'s help, to get \\'emout of the head of him, an\\' nowadays, when he goes to one of themSocialist meetin\\'s by night, I make him make up by goin\\' with me toearly mass next mornin\\'.\"She paused and surveyed again the pale woman before her.  EssentiallyKatie had not changed.  She had still, and would always have, thebig, kind heart and the ready hand of her earlier days.  But hercondition had altered, and Mary\\'s had evidently again fallen; shelooked through an alien atmosphere, and her gaze was distant: theresponsibilities and adjustment of young married life shackled her,and must continue to shackle her until they were no longer new.  Shedid not know how to suggest any assistance, did not even believe thatit was desired; but, though she still felt that she must refrain fromintimate inquiry, one effort she tried to make.\"An\\' you,\" she asked--\"how\\'re you gettin\\' on, Mary?\"Mary bit her lip.\"Fine,\" she answered, huskily.\"Are you----?  There ain\\'t----?\"  Katie floundered in a maze that shewould, a few months previously or a few months in the future, havecut her way through with a strong directness.  \"There ain\\'t nothin\\' Icould----?\"Mary\\'s head shook, almost mechanically.  It was not entirely that shefelt unable to accept assistance from her former protector; it wasrather that she felt only that she must run away.\"Oh, no,\" she said, forcing a smile.  \"I\\'m doin\\' grand.\"The gala crowd was sweeping about them.  It jostled both girls andthreatened momentarily to separate them.  After all, there wasnothing more to be said.\"I--I got to go,\" murmured Mary.  \"I got an appointment----\"\"But you\\'ll come to see us sometime, won\\'t you Mary?\" asked Katie,and she gave her address.  \"We\\'ll have a fine party at thechristening an\\' I\\'ll want you to see the baby.\"\"Oh, yes,\" said Mary; \"yes, of course.\"But Katie was hesitant.\"You\\'re sure I can\\'t do nothin\\'?\" she asked.\"No, no.  I----\"  Mary caught and pressed with what warmth there wasleft in her fingers, the Irish girl\\'s hand.  \"Good-by,\" sheconcluded, and then, in order to keep up the farce of an appointment,she got upon a passing car.Even if panic had not possessed her, she could not have acceptedanything that Katie might offer.  The most that could have been givenher would have been but temporary, and what she must have was a meansof earning a living.She rode well downtown, and then walked farther southward.  Sheslipped along the broad, yellow-lighted Bowery, gathering one or twoquarters on her way, and wandered into the narrow, serpentine,fevered alleys of Chinatown.  When an ugly rain began to fall, theopen door of a mission attracted her, and she went in to rest.It was the typical mission-room, very different from the uptownchurch where she had seen the wedding.  This new place was mean; ithad a low ceiling and was none too clean.  The lights were flaringand the dull walls were enlivened by boldly lettered Bible texts.The air was close; on the platform, at the front of the place, awell-fed man was pleading, in sweat and tears, the cause of hisreligion; nearby, his double was making ready the reed-organ.Crowded into the unsteady benches were pimpled boys with lollingmouths and preternaturally knowing eyes; youths already old indisease and drink and crime; full-grown men, frog-eyed or blear-eyed,who needed only the faculty of firmness and the chance to cultivateit; old men, who had lost their hold upon work in a country still toobarbarous to pension its aged; and, though there were no young girls,here and there Mary saw a few women, bedraggled, sodden, hideous,because men had at some time thought them _chic_, dainty, beautiful.One of the \"workers\" attached to the place--a bland, prosperous man,with a pleasant smile--approached Mary and shook her hand as if hewere an old acquaintance.  He had fat red cheeks, firm teeth, andkindly eyes.\"I\\'m glad to see you, sister,\" he said.  \"Are you saved?\"Mary\\'s childhood had heard some of the phraseology of evangelicalism.She understood, but she had come to receive worldly, not spiritual,warmth.\"No,\" she said, \"I ain\\'t.\"The \"worker,\" however, was accustomed to that reply.  He patted hershoulder.\"Don\\'t you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ?\" he asked.\"Well,\" said Mary, \"I never thought much about Him.\"She looked at the floor.  She was cold and hungry and afraid.\"Then,\" responded the man, with genuine earnestness, \"you ought tobegin to think.  No man knoweth the hour of His comin\\'.  He is readywith the Free Gift.  Don\\'t you want to come to Him?\"Mary\\'s life had been one in which there had been small time for thecultivation of religious emotion, and no time at all for thecultivation of religious thought.  At her home she had learned asmuch by rote as she had had to learn, but what she got she held onlyas so many tasks performed.  The words were lessons to be mastered;if they had any relation to facts, those facts were things not to befaced until an age of discretion, and, pending the arrival of thatage, the lessons had been stored away with a bland, childishpracticality.  What followed later had driven out all that precededit.  The shock of her capture; the wild, new order of existence; theendeavor to escape; the battle of service among new conditions; and,at last, the dulling of all the finer sensibilities and the finalfight for a mere chance to continue alive--these were circumstancesneither propitious to theology nor favorable to faith.She glanced at the mission-worker, and then glanced away.\"I dunno,\" she said.  \"I guess I ain\\'t the kind of woman religion cando much for.\"\"Don\\'t say that,\" protested the man.  His eyes shone with zeal andhis voice was tender.  \"His grace is free for all who come.  Hismercy is from everlastin\\' to everlastin\\'.  I\\'ve been a sinnermyself\"--the speaker\\'s voice swelled with a real pride--\"a terriblesinner, an\\' I know what I say, praise the Lord.  The meaner an\\' vilerwe are, the more Jesus needs us.  Just open your heart.  Just acceptHim, an\\' you\\'ll never know no more trouble in this world nor thenext.\"\"Would I get a job?\" asked Mary.The man shook his head, sadly.\"That ain\\'t no way to think about salvation,\" he declared.  \"What\\'sfreely given ought to be freely received.  Now is the appointed time.\"\"But I gotta make a livin\\'.\"\"I know it, I know it.  We\\'ve all got to do that, but ain\\'t it betterto make one an\\' be saved than to make one an\\' be sent to hell-fire?\"She assented.  \"Only,\" she added, \"I don\\'t want to starve, even if Iam saved.\"It was his old difficulty.\"I know,\" he repeated; \"an\\' we\\'d only be too glad to get you work ifwe could, but times are hard an\\' we\\'ve got a waitin\\'-list of fifty atthis very minute.  Here\\'s some meal-tickets, sister, fer we want todo what we can, an\\' we know it\\'s hard to save souls on emptystomachs.  You just think it over an\\' see if I\\'m not right aboutreligion.\"She took the tickets and used them at a five-cent eating-house duringthe next day.  That night she managed to secure a bed in a room overa saloon--a narrow, stuffy room that she shared with three otherwomen of her own sort; but the next night she earned nothing, and shehad been compelled to pawn her coat for food.  She sought a bench inUnion Square, where two tattered men made room for her.  They gaveher, to wrap about her chest, newspapers that they had gathered fromthe gutter; and she dozed until the sharp command of a policemanscattered her comrades, when they made their way to the rear of theFlatiron Building and stood, for warmth, over a grill that sent upoccasional blasts of heat from the basement.The rapidity with which one may descend from bad to worse is to bebelieved only by those who have been penniless and friendless in thelarger cities.  During the nights that followed, when Mary\\'s clothesgrew speedily ragged, dirty, and odorous, and when she earned justenough money to postpone starvation, she became a familiar ofChinatown, learned something of its blind paths and the tangledpassages of its fetid tenements.  The almond-eyed Orientalstolerantly received her.  She came to know the heavy odors of theopium, to chat with clay-white American girls, morphine-eaters, andcocaine and chloral victims, whose Chinese lovers were kind to them,and who never wanted to breathe the open air.  She was borne with,but the market was over-supplied there, and she found no regularkeeper.  She came to envy the drug-enslaved women who had firstsought the Mott Street district as missionaries, even the littleMongolian girls over whose slavery, so much lighter than her own, thecity, from time to time, grew ludicrously excited.  Her illnessprogressed, but, thanks to her hardy birth and the exercise of whatcare was at all possible, it progressed with a step so tardy as togive no indication of reaching its tragic end, other things beingequal, for two years or more.  She did not again go to see thedoctor; she did not have to.  The only things that he could haveadvised were the things that she was in no position to do.  Beyond acertain limited amount of routine care, she was helpless.One night, wet and exhausted, she met a sailor in Chatham Square, anddrank long with him.\"Where you goin\\' to sleep to-night?\" he asked, as they were about topart.He was a short, black-browed man, who walked with a bow-legged roll.The short sleeves of his jacket displayed sinewy, bronze wrists withanchors tattooed upon them.  His neck rose out of his low-cutmariner\\'s shirt like the neck of a brown, fighting bull, and hisblack eyes, set deep under bushy, frowning brows, were red, likethose of a bull that is dangerous.  He had been taken with a drunkenpassion for her, and though, when he kissed her, his upper lipscraped her face like a file, though his incessant grip of her handshurt her, and though his heavy foot, seeking hers beneath thesaloon-table, nearly crushed her own, she had to answer him with theprofessional smile.\"I dunno where I\\'ll sleep,\" she said.  \"I guess Lee Hung\\'s Letty\\'llput me up.\"The sailor chucked her pointed chin so roughly that she thought herneck would crack.\"Why don\\'t you come along o\\' me?\" he inquired.\"Where\\'s that?\"\"To one o\\' our places.  I know a beauty, an\\' I\\'ll take good care o\\'you, an\\' afterward you can stay on.\"\"One of your places?  What\\'s those?\"\"Places we visit.  Places for seafarin\\' men.  I tells you I knows adaisy--Big Lou\\'s keepin\\' it--an\\' they needs a new gal there, for Istopped in as I come ashore this evenin\\' an\\' they tole me the one Iknew after last voyage was buried only yesterday.\"Mary shuddered.\"Is it all right?\" she asked.\"All right?  Course it\\'s all right.  But mind you,\"--his black eyesleaped into a sudden threat--\"I\\'m takin\\' you to-night.  Nophilanderin\\'.  For this night y\\'er my gal.\"She looked away.\"Mind you that,\" he drunkenly repeated.  \"I\\'m mostly as gentle asNathan\\'s lamb, but when I\\'m tricked I\\'m ready with my hands.  It\\'sall right.  It\\'s a good place for a good time.  Plenty to drink an\\'the best o\\' company.  Better come.  I can fix it so\\'s you can get asteady job there.\"She shivered again, but she could not see why she should shiver.After all, she was glad to learn of any place where she would be sureof food to eat and a roof to cover her--and so she came toSummerton\\'s.XXIXTHE DOORS OF THE SHADOWIt is a winding and tortuous way across Greenwich Village toSummerton\\'s.  The mazed course runs through streets that squirm likeworms between a fisherman\\'s fingers; it skirts cobbled courts thatare in twilight at midday and damp in the longest drought; it turnsand doubles up passages that seem blind, dodges through the verybones of tumble-down warehouses, storehouses, houses so ramshacklethat the imagination can conjure no possible use for them, and itcomes out at last into a foul thoroughfare that appears to be nobetter than a stinking alley, so close to the water\\'s edge that themasts of the river\\'s cluttered craft look as if they grew upon thedirty, sagging roofs opposite, and so near to the wharves that thegreen walls of the buildings are wet and odorous as if from acontinuous application of bilge-water.By day, when its residents are asleep, this street is loud withstraining Norman horses, and clattering vans, and whip-crackingcarters from the docks; but by night--and the nights are very darkdown there--it becomes the haunt of sailors and longshoremen, drunkand shouting, or still and drugged.  Then the blue electric lampssnap hysterically at distant corners; the uneven pavement mountssteeply upward, or dashes precipitately downward, with no warning;laughter and curses and the crash of breaking glass or splutteringoaths issue now and again from the blackness at one\\'s elbow, where,hidden among the warehouses, stand the houses for the storing ofanother sort of wares: the slave-houses maintained for mariners.Grotesque men, could you see them, stagger into dim entrances;terrible caricatures of women, if the light would show them, stealout and dart upon gutter-couched drunkards to paw their pockets.  Thenight is alive with shadows, and the whole street a hungry, quiveringquicksand.Only by urging her eyes to their utmost could Mary make out anythingof the house before which she and her unsteady companion came topause.  Even then all of which she could be sure was that, coweringunder the shadow of some huge brick building, and skulking beneathits own rotting eaves, it was a half-sunken, old, narrow house, longsince abandoned as unfit for legitimate purposes, and leaningrakishly to one side, like an ancient libertine that knows his eviland grins at it.The sailor knocked lightly at an almost unseen door.  A panel of itslid open and threw a ray of light on his face.\"Who\\'s there?\" asked a voice that was like the rasping of a file.\"It\\'s Billy,\" said the sailor.\"Billy who?\"\"Billy Stevens.  Le\\'me in, Lou.\"A pair of swollen eyes came to the open panel and looked, down theshaft of light, into the sinister face of Bill.\"Who\\'s that with you?\" croaked the voice.\"A gal I got for you.\"\"Is she all right?\"\"O\\' course she is, Lou; else what in hell\\'d she be doin\\' with me?Come on; le\\'me in.\"The swollen eyes disappeared, and the panel was shut.  There was asound of the withdrawal of several bolts.  Then the door swung open,was closed and relocked behind the newcomers, and Mary found herselfin an unfurnished hall, not more than fifteen feet square, lighted bya dim lamp standing on the lowest step of a steep flight of stairs,and guarded by the owner of the swollen eyes.At least in height, \"Big Lou\" was gigantic.  She was fully six feettall; she stooped a little and was extremely thin, with a hollowchest and narrow flanks, partially hidden by an old red cottondressing-gown; but the long arms were like flails, and Lou had atemper that did not hesitate to use them as such.  Her dirty brownhair was already touched with gray; she had almost no chin; her nosewas a smudge in her sodden face and her cheeks were heavy with yearsof drunkenness.  Her mouth hung loose and quarrelsome, and, as shebent over to look hard at Mary, her breath was foul.She addressed herself, however, entirely to the black-browed Stevens.\"Where\\'d you git her?\" she asked, as if Mary were one of the animalsnot gifted with articulate speech.Stevens told of their meeting.\"Where\\'s she from?\"The sailor gave a rapid and wholly fictitious biography.\"How old?\"\"Twenty,\" said Bill.\"I ain\\'t!\" protested Mary.But the sailor shot her an ugly look.\"Close your trap,\" he told her, and then, to Big Lou, he repeated:\"Twenty.\"Big Lou picked up the lamp and, holding it in one blackened claw,passed the other over Mary, with dexterous appraisement, fromshoulders to knees.\"I\\'ll give you a five-spot for her,\" she croaked.\"You\\'ll go to the devil,\" retorted Bill.\"Six?\"\"Ten.\"\"You\\'re a damned thief, Stevens, that\\'s what you are,\" growled theold woman.  \"I\\'ll give you seven, an\\' not another God damned cent.\"Mary leaned against the moist wall.  She was now past caring, and shehardly heard.\"Make it seven-seventy-five,\" said Bill, with sudden ingratiation.Big Lou raised the lamp again and again regarded the animal, herswollen eyes sharpening.\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do,\" she said, once more facing the sailor.\"Are you goin\\' to stop here to-night?\"\"Yes.\"\"Well, I\\'ll come up in the mornin\\' and take a closer look.  If shepasses that, I\\'ll give you seven-fifty.\"Bill\\'s brown face worked in thought, but the thirst for liquor wasupon him, and he compromised.\"All right,\" he said--\"if you\\'ll give me five down on account.\"The giantess flung aside her red dressing-gown and, from a blackcotton stocking that hung loose upon a shriveled shank, drew a fewgreasy bills.  From these she reluctantly counted five, handed themto Stevens, and returned the rest to their original place of safety.\"G\\'on up,\" she said.  \"I stay here till work\\'s done, an\\' take tolls.\"From somewhere in the shadows she produced a black flask and, asMary, with the sailor\\'s tattooed hand tightly under her arm, beganthe steep ascent, Big Lou settled herself at her post of gatekeeperupon the lowest step.Those stairs seemed almost perpendicular.  They rose out of thedarkness of the hallway at an alarming angle; each step was closeupon a foot high; they were not a yard wide, their upper half wasboxed between two walls, and they opened directly into the room thatevidently served as the parlor of Big Lou Summerton\\'s establishment.The room was small and badly lighted by a kerosene hand-lamp, whichstood upon a circular center-table and sent up a thin column of smoketo the sooty ceiling.  A spotted lounge with dilapidated springsstood in one corner; the faded paper was peeling from the plaster,and a broken stove, which glowed an angry red, heated the place to adegree that was well-nigh unbearable.  The air was stale and rancid,both from the company that was present and from a long entertainmentof similar companies, in days gone by.There were only two persons in the room.  Both were seated at thetable, both were drinking whiskey poured into ragged-edged glassesfrom a bottle that stood between them, and both were, or had been,women.  Of these one coughed so sharply and constantly between hertoothless gums, and was so shrunken under her blue calicomother-hubbard, that it was plain she would soon be nothing; whilethe other was a creature with face red and bloated, features stuntedand coarse, eyes that glowed dully, and the voice of a crow.Stevens presented Mary to them, and wasted no formalities.\"This here\\'s a new one,\" he said, and, motioning his charge to athird chair, himself pulled up a fourth.The two inmates received her with a loud duet that was almost achoral jeer.  Two more glasses were produced from a shadowy cupboard,and the drinking recommenced.Mary took one long drink and, wasted by privation, passed at once forsome time into a daze in which, though she saw all, she reckonedlittle.  She heard Stevens drop into the babbling stage ofdrunkenness; she noted that, though the women kept pace with hispotations, they poured water into their own whiskey and gin into thesailor\\'s; she saw him loll in his chair and sway over the table; shefelt his heavy head drop at last on her thin shoulder, and she didnot move while, as he lay there, his companions--now hers--wentthrough his clothes and tiptoed out of a rear door.It was then that, with a quick start, she regained control of herselfat the sound of speech below and the tread of feet on the stairs.  Arough voice had assured Big Lou that \"it was all right,\" and anothervoice was supplementing:\"Rest easy, my dear lady: we are paying as we go.  Michael, here, is,as you know, a deck-hand on the admirable yacht of my admirablefriend Marsden Payne, with whom I have been on a winter excursion;and he has kindly consented to show me his own section of little oldNew York.\"Mary knew that voice, although she could not at once identify it;but, though she sprang up so quickly that she wakened the tumblingStevens, who slipped to the floor, she could not escape before shefound herself directly regarding the flushed face, glowing gray eyes,and disordered hair of Philip Beekman.Still young and slim in his yachting clothes, he looked at her,swaying a little in the doorway, his back to those perilous stairs,and with no clear recognition.\"Hello!\" he said.  \"I think I\\'ve had the pleasure of meeting yousomewhere before.\"Mary\\'s mouth tightened.  She had herself now well in hand.  She shookher russet head.\"I guess not,\" she said.But her voice betrayed her.\"Good Lord!\" said Beekman.  The flush deepened on his face.  With onehand he snatched his yachting-cap from his black hair; the other hesuddenly held out to her, trembling.  \"Good Lord!\" he repeated, thistime with something that was nearly awe in his tone.  \"I--I--it\\'s_Violet_!  Will you----?  Won\\'t you _please_ shake hands?\"Scarcely less amazed by his manner than was he by her appearance, shetook his hand.Beekman turned to someone on the stairs behind him.\"Get out, Mike!\" he said.  \"I\\'ve found a friend.\"There was a plucking at his sleeve and the murmur of a concernedvoice from the rear.\"No,\" said Philip; \"get out.  I tell you that I have found a friend.Go down to the tall lady and hand her your money and then make tracksfor the yacht.  You may tell Mr. Payne that I shall return in anhour.\"Again a muffled protest from the dangerous stairway.\"Pardon me a moment,\" said Beekman, and turned full around.  \"Now,then,\" he continued to his guide, \"you get out.  I am perfectly wellable to take care of myself, and I want a private talk.  Do youexpect me to kick you downstairs?  No?  I should probably break yourback if I did.--Then, good-night.\"He stood there while the deckhand\\'s heavy feet clattered downward;waited until he had heard Big Lou grumblingly give Mike the means ofexit, and then he turned again to Mary.\"What,\" he rapidly began, and his handsome face grew once moreearnest, \"what in the name of heaven are you doing in this den?--No,\"he continued, raising a quick hand; \"don\\'t tell me; I remember how Isent you out of my mother\\'s house and, upon my word, I\\'m afraid tohear.  I couldn\\'t do anything else--but I don\\'t know.  Anyhow,there\\'s one thing sure: you need money.  Well, I made a little in thegame to-night--not much for Payne, but a good slice for me--and it\\'syours--it\\'s yours--the Lord knows it ought to go to you!\"She had tried to stop him until he spoke of money; but when hementioned that, she let him run on, let him search his pockets, andat last let him thrust something into her open hand.\"Here,\" he said; \"take it; take it as a favor to me; take it, andremember what I said to you in Rose\\'s.  Watch your chance; get out ofhere; and for God\\'s sake go back to your own home.\"Her fingers closed upon the bills and transferred them to herstocking; and as she did this a movement on the floor made them bothturn.Bill Stevens, whom Mary had forgotten and whom Beekman had not seen,gathered himself together, and at last stood more or less uprightupon his unsteady bowed legs.  His heavy body rocked uneasily, buthis dark face, with its bushy brows and sinister eyes, was thrustforward glowering.  One sinewy tattooed hand gripped the back of achair; the other, knotted into a hard fist, he raised slowly towardBeekman.\"It\\'s your turn to go,\" he said, with a lingering oath.  \"This here\\'smy gal; she b\\'longs to me--an\\' so does any money she gits.\"Instantly Philip was his old, assured self.  That quality which wasmost characteristic of him, that curious mixture of much that wasbitter and a little that was sweet, lighted his eyes and rang in hisvoice.\"Where do _you_ come from?\" he asked, smiling.  \"You look as if yougot out of a trap-door, like the fairy in the play.\"\"None o\\' your business where I come from,\" said Bill.  \"The point iswhere I\\'ll send you, if you ain\\'t careful.\"Mary, who did not like the looks of things, tried to interpose.  Sheput the palms of her hands against the sailor\\'s rough cheeks.\"Listen, Bill,\" she said, \"this is an old friend of mine----\"\"Likely!\" grunted Bill.\"He is, though; ain\\'t you?\" Mary appealed, with a sidelong glance atBeekman.\"Certainly I am,\" said Philip.Stevens lowered his fist, but his red eyes remained full of hate.\"I don\\'t care who you are,\" he rumbled; \"this here\\'s my woman.\"\"All right,\" said Beekman; \"that\\'s to your credit, I\\'m sure: a man isknown by the woman he keeps, and you can\\'t have a better.  Only, yousee, my friend----\"\"I ain\\'t yer friend.\"Once more Mary interposed.\"Just sit down, Bill,\" she urged.  \"Sit down an\\' have a drink withus.  You can hear all we got to say.\"Stevens sank into a chair, but when Beekman, with Mary between them,pushed the bottle toward Bill, the sailor would have none of it.\"I\\'ll stop a bit,\" he said, \"but I ain\\'t goin\\' to drink with you, an\\'you needn\\'t think it.\"Philip was still undisturbed.\"Have it your own way,\" he said.  \"I know how it is: when a man fallsin love, he swears off liquor; when he falls out of love he takes toliquor again--one sort of drunkenness is as much as he can stand at atime.  I\\'ll take a drink.\"Mary, who now began to fear acute trouble, slipped a hand to Stevens,but he drew away.\"I think I\\'ll smoke--if I may,\" continued the undisturbed Beekman.\"A pipe is domestic, a cigar is philosophic, and a cigarette is acynic: I shall have a cigarette.  William?\"--And he offered hissilver case to the sailor.\"No,\" said Stevens, shortly.Beekman tossed his head.  Mary saw his gray eyes snap.\"William,\" he said, \"you have got to learn that the best girl isnever so good as the next.  And you have got to learn manners.  Ifyou won\\'t behave yourself properly, I think you had better leave.\"Stevens\\'s fingers opened and closed slowly.\"You go to hell,\" he said.Beekman rose quietly.  His cigarette was in one hand, and with theother, instead of threatening, he pointed to the stairway.\"Run along,\" he said.Stevens jumped to his feet and crouched, like a panther ready tospring.  Mary, overturning her chair, flung her arms about him andpinioned him in an embrace.\"Don\\'t, Bill!\" she whispered, and, over her shoulder: \"Don\\'t, Mr.Beekman!  Can\\'t you two be friends?  Can\\'t you see it\\'s all right,Bill?  Can\\'t you let him alone, Mr. Beekman?  Bill, you know how muchI think of you.\"She put her lips to his rough face.  She whispered rapid, unthoughtlies into his ear.  She caressed and cajoled him, and at last, whenPhilip had been persuaded into a half-scornful apology, she managedto get Stevens out of the room and started him down the stairway toseek sympathy of Big Lou while she herself had her talk with Beekman.They sat down again at the round table and took a drink.  Philipwanted to upbraid himself for his conduct to her in his mother\\'shouse, and yet, because he felt that he could have followed no coursesave that which he had taken, he did not know how to begin: all thathe was sure of was that there was a wrong somewhere, and that he mustsomehow make confession of it.  Mary, on the other hand, was dividedbetween panic from the trouble so lately avoided and a desire to hearfrom Philip nothing approaching condolence.She sought escape in the commonplace.\"You mustn\\'t mind him,\" she said, with a nod toward the stairs downwhich the glowering Bill had departed.\"Not a bit,\" answered Beekman.  \"I only wanted to get rid of him inorder to tell you hew sorry I am for--for--oh, you know.\"\"Don\\'t talk about that, Mr. Beekman--please.\"\"But I must talk about it.\"\"Not now; not yet.  Tell me how you are.\"\"Oh, I\\'m as near right as I ever am, or ever will be.  But,Violet----\"\"You\\'re looking rich.\"His eyes followed hers to his gilt-buttoned yachting jacket.\"You can never judge a man by his clothes,\" he said.  \"Necessity isthe mother of pretension.\"\"Are you married yet?\"\"Hardly.  There are only two things that a man can\\'t honestlypromise: to love, and to cease to love.  I\\'m still too poor to affordthose lies.\"Mary only half understood his mood, but she was wholly intent onkeeping him free of dreaded topics.\"Do you hear anything of the people we used to know?\" she asked.\"Well,\" said Philip, \"Rose was let off, you know, and is back at theold address and the old business.\"  He looked at his watch andstarted.  \"By Jove,\" he continued; \"I must have been pretty tight.  Ihad no idea it was so late.  I\\'ve got to be getting back to the yachtsoon.\"He stood up, his cap in one hand.  Mary followed him to the stairdoor, and there he turned.\"Violet,\" he said, \"I am going to tell you how sorry I am.  I amgoing to tell you, whether you like to hear it or not.\"The flush had gone from his face and eyes, leaving them simple andsincere.Mary\\'s voice faltered.  She understood some things that she had neverbefore understood.\"It didn\\'t matter none,\" she replied.  \"You couldn\\'t help it.\"\"I daresay I couldn\\'t.  I don\\'t know.  These things are too much forme.  But I do know that I am sorry--sorry from the bottom of myheart.  And if I can ever do anything--anything----\"He put out his hand, and, as she took it, he raised her hand to hislips.At that instant there was a yell of rage from behind him.  Mary,springing back, saw him half turn and reel.  She saw a brown,tattooed hand close about his throat, choking his cry of alarm.  Shesaw Bill Stevens\\'s distorted face and red eyes appear above Beekman\\'sshoulder.  She saw a knife flash and bury itself deep in the youngman\\'s side.  And then, with a tremendous smash, both men disappeareddown those murderous, black stairs.It seemed to Mary that she lost not a moment in running down to them;yet, when she reached the hall, the little drama was finished.  Thesailor was lying stunned in a corner, and Big Lou, with the rescuedlamp beside her, was kneeling above Philip\\'s body and running herquick claws through his pockets.\"Damn your soul, get upstairs!\" she cried to Mary.But Mary hesitated.  Overhead she heard the skurry of skirts andhurried feet.  Before her lay the man that had once so harmed her.His coat had been torn open and a great red smear grew larger andlarger upon his white silk shirt.  His mouth was twisted, but still.His gray eyes stared at the begrimed ceiling: Philip Beekman was dead.She leaped across the body, tore back the bolts, flung open the door,and nearly fell into the pitch-black street.As she ran around the nearest corner, she heard the cry of Mike, thedeckhand, who must have been waiting nearby, and then the sharpalarm-call of a policeman\\'s night-stick.XXXHER FATHER\\'S HOUSEHer way must have led her first to the river and then well northward:she did not know.  She did not even know whether she ran or walked.All that she did know was that, at least for hours to come, she mustput as many miles as she could between her own tossing thoughts andthat still face with the staring eyes which lay at the foot of thesteep, dark stairs in Summerton\\'s.  The clocks, had she looked atthem, would have told her that the night was gone, but the winterdarkness still enveloped the city when she found herself at laststanding before an illuminated ticket-window and addressing a sleepyclerk at a ferry.\"I want a ticket,\" she said, and laid down one of the bills thatPhilip Beekman had given her.\"Where to?\" yawned the clerk.How did it happen that the name which rose to her lips was the nameof her native town--a word that she had not uttered since the morningof her awakening in the house of Rose Légère?  Perhaps it was becausethe dead man had, with almost his last words, pleaded with her to gohome; perhaps it was because that name, of which she had for so longtried never to think, was, in reality, the one always nearest to herheart; perhaps it was only because no other town was familiar to her.In any event, the name was spoken without consideration of theconsequences, and, before she had time to pause or to repent, theclerk had handed her the change, and with it the bit of pasteboardthat would bear her home.\"There\\'s a boat in ten minutes,\" he said: \"but you\\'ll have to wait anhour in Jersey City.  The first train doesn\\'t go till six-five.\"Of what immediately followed she had, thereafter, no clearrecollection.  She remembered only buying a cold sandwich and ahalf-pint of whiskey in a deserted café; crossing a bitterly cold,sullen stretch of water from a twinkling cañon to a shadowy shore;walking, for warmth, weary though she was, up and down, and up anddown, along a damp, echoing train-shed, and then, at last, passing aclanging iron gate, climbing into a coach, and falling, nearlystupefied, into an uncomfortable, red-plush covered seat.  She hadbut the faintest mental picture of changing cars, and none at all ofany subsequent incident, until, in a black dawn, there flashed uponher, from between the frost-figures on the window, a bit of landscapethat warned her she was approaching home.The track came suddenly to the river-side.  Beneath a gray sky,which, though the morning was well advanced, the sun seemed afraid toclimb, there raced the mile-and-a-half wide strip of gray water.  Itcrashed across a ruined dam; it swept above a submerged \"chute\"through which, years before, the big pine-rafts from the upperAlleghanies used to be hurled on their way to the Chesapeake.  Therehad been a thaw: only here and there could Mary see the ominouscrests of the rocks that threatened the mid-channel; the islands,with trees bare of foliage, were under water, and far away, from thecloudy York County shore, the high hills rose above the mist, dun andcheerless, forbidding and cold.  With a quick catch in her throat,she saw the river-road that she had so often tramped on holidays, nowaxle-deep in mud.  Over there were the leafless woods where, when theboughs were green, the children used to picnic, and here, nearer thetown, where patches of soiled snow hid under the stunted pines, wasthe path where one time came, for pink laurel branches, a girl thatshe had been.  The engine whistled sharply and stopped.Mary mechanically readjusted the hat that she had not touched sinceshe had put it on for the work of the evening previous--the eveningso long ago.  She stepped to the platform.The station was just as it had always been.  It looked smaller anddirtier, but she knew that it had not changed; and a sharp pain shotthrough her heart at the realization that, in this town, everythinghad gone on its placid way while so much had been happening to one ofits children.  There were the same grinning gamins waiting for theNew York newspapers; the same negro porters from the two hotels; thesame station-master \"calling the train,\" just as he used to call itin the days when she had watched the outgoing coaches with enviouslongings for a sight of the strange lands toward which they werebound.Then, as her aching feet touched the cinder of the thoroughfare, sherealized her danger.  She had no plan, no scheme of accounting forherself; some unreasoned impulse, partly, doubtless, the primalinstinct that drives the wounded beast to its den, had overcome herfears and turned her face in the direction of the home whither shehad, for so long, dreaded to return.  But now she was seized with aterror of recognition by the townspeople, and so she lowered her headand walked, with the swiftness of panic, among the little knot ofloafers about the station-door.Now that she was here, what was she to say, what to do, where toturn?  She moved, unable to evolve any order from the chaos of herthoughts.  She could only go over and over the memory of that lastday in school; the early violets, purple and fragrant, peepingthrough the lush grass on the lawns of Second Street; the flamingoriole in the Southwark yard; the lazy sunlight flowing through theopen windows of Miss England\\'s sleepy classroom.  Mary\\'s blue eyeswere bright then, her mouth was red, her cheeks pink; lithe,strong-limbed, and firm of body, her walk had owned the easy, languidgrace of a wild animal.  And now, the lawns were bare; only a fewpersistent sparrows hopped in the gutters and along the ground; thesky was empty of sunlight, and she----She came to a supreme pause.  Habit had led her aimless feet.  Shewas standing, in the full morning, before the two-story brick housethat was her father\\'s home.She knew that the door remained unlocked from dawn to night; but shedid not at once enter.  She was afraid to go in, afraid to standstill, afraid to go away.Then, from the next house, came decision.  It was Etta\\'s, her marriedsister\\'s place, and she heard someone within it rattle at its door.Anything was better than a meeting with Etta: Mary quietly opened thedoor to her father\\'s house and slipped inside.She went down the brief, darkened hallway, past the drawn curtains ofthe parlor, through the twilight of the dining-room, and stopped atthe open entrance to the small, crowded kitchen, where, among neatlyarranged and brightly polished pots and pans, her mother was bendingover the glowing stove.Mrs. Denbigh looked up with a start.  Still stooped, stillhatchet-faced, but grayer and more shrunken, she stood there, hersleeves rolled from her thin forearms, her forehead wet by presentlabor, her mouth set hard by labors gone.\"Get out o\\' here!\" she said.\"Mom!\"Mary raised and spread her arms in quick petitioning, and then, inthat stranger, Mrs. Denbigh recognized her child.\"_You?_\" she cried.She dashed her damp hands to her checkered apron; she stepped towardher daughter with her own arms wide.  She bent to kiss her--and shedrew as suddenly away.\"There\\'s liquor on your breath!\" she gasped.\"I know,\" said Mary, her voice low and trembling.  \"I--I ain\\'t beenwell, mom.\"The kiss was given, but less abandonedly than it had promised, and,as the mother drew away, her keen eyes searched the girl from face tofeet.  Over the multitude of maternal questions there rose the threefor which Mary was least prepared.\"Mary--what is it?  Where is he?  Didn\\'t he treat you right?\"They caught the girl at her weakest point.\"Who?\" she asked.\"Who?\"--Mrs. Denbigh\\'s eyes grew stern again.--\"Who?  You needn\\'t sayno more than that still!  I ought to have knowed when I seen you.Nobody could look at you yet and not know.  Why, you\\'re--you\\'re_old_!  Your things are worn out.  You----\" her tone increased toloud accusations.  \"Where did you get them clothes?\"Mary\\'s lips faltered.\"I bought \\'em,\" she said.\"Did anybody see you come in here?\"\"I don\\'t know.--No, nobody did.\"\"Thank God for that!\"  Mrs. Denbigh pointed a long, gnarled finger ather daughter.  She pointed it at the bedraggled hat, still bearingtraces of a finery too pronounced for that small town.  She pointedto the waist and to the skirt.  \"It\\'s true, then!\" she cried.  \"It\\'strue, then!  You\\'ve been a bad woman!\"In the doorway Mary swayed.  She leaned heavily against the wall.She was too tired to lie.\"Yes,\" she whispered.\"Yes,\" her mother echoed; \"yes--an\\' you own up to it!  The whole townsaid it; your pop said it; they all told me yet--an\\' I stood up feryou; I showed \\'em your letter; I says you was married; I kep\\' onbelievin\\' you\\'d write; I stuck to it--an\\' now you come here to shameme.  You come here when you\\'re worn out--when no one else\\'ll haveyou--you come here, brazen, not carin\\' still, a bad woman--_a badwoman_--an\\' I guess you think I\\'ll take you in!\"Her poor face writhed.  Her dim eyes shot fire.  Her withered breastsrose and fell in a spasm of indignation and wounded pride.Mary, still leaning against the kitchen wall, put out her hands as ifto ward away a blow.\"Don\\'t, mom,\" she said.  \"Please don\\'t.\"\"I will!  I\\'ve a mind to beat you.  I\\'d like to know what possessedyou to flaunt yourself in this place.  You can\\'t stay here.  Youcan\\'t stay in this house that you\\'ve shamed still, an\\' you can\\'t stayin this town.\"\"Mom!\"\"You can\\'t stay in this town.  Do you hear that?  If you do, if youtry to stay here and mock me, a decent woman, I\\'ll have you arrested;I\\'ll have you sent to the lock-up; I\\'ll----\"\"Mom,\" interrupted Mary.  \"I won\\'t hurt you.  I didn\\'t mean to hurtnobody.  I didn\\'t come here to do no harm.\"\"How kin you come here yet without doin\\' harm?  Ain\\'t you done enoughwithout comin\\' back here to shame your own folks?\"\"But, mom,\" Mary pleaded, \"I won\\'t shame nobody; I\\'ll do whatever yousay.\"Little Mrs. Denbigh collapsed upon a kitchen chair.  She rocked fromside to side.  She fanned herself with her checkered apron; griefconquered anger; and long dried tears came at last to her old eyesand coursed, unrestrained, down her hard cheeks.\"What did I ever do fer to deserve this?\" she moaned.  \"What did Iever do to receive this judgment?  A child o\\' mine!  A child o\\' mine!An\\' her the baby that she was!  Didn\\'t her pop an\\' me bring her upthe best we could?  Ain\\'t I always lived accordin\\' to the Lord\\'sword?  What have I done to deserve this?\"Mary stepped to the weeping woman\\'s side.  She put her fingers to thegray hair and stroked it, timidly.\"Go away!\" cried the mother.  \"Don\\'t you dare to touch me!  Don\\'t youdare yet to pollute me!  Oh!  A child o\\' mine to do this!\"She fell into another paroxysm of grief, and Mary sank to her kneesand took one of the gnarled hands between her own hands.\"Listen, mom,\" she said; \"I\\'ll tell you all about it, an\\' then you\\'llknow.\"She did tell her, as much as she dared; but Mrs. Denbigh only halfunderstood.  The elder woman\\'s life had been cast in a mold; it hadlong since hardened into a destined shape, and no sympathy on her ownpart, no explanations on the part of another, could alter her.  Direnecessity she had often known, but she had not known it amidsurroundings where the sufferer\\'s only course was that which alonehad been possible for Mary.  If she softened, it was not because shecomprehended, but because Mary was her child.\"Don\\'t tell me no more,\" she said at last.  \"You could \\'a\\' gone towork.\"\"I tried that, an\\' nobody\\'d have me.\"\"You could \\'a\\' gone to some church-folk.\"\"I did, but they couldn\\'t get me a job.\"\"You could \\'a\\' gone to some institution a\\'ready.\"\"How\\'d I have lived after I come out?\"\"Well, you shouldn\\'t \\'a\\' run away in the first place.  Didn\\'t wetreat you right?\"To have answered that question in the negative would not have been tobe altogether true, and Mary did not even yet see enough clearly todiscern that the conditions which had driven her from home wereeconomic forces that made parents and child equally blameless.\"Can\\'t I stay here?\" she appealed.  \"Can\\'t I please stay here an\\'work for you?\"Mrs. Denbigh shook her head.\"I\\'d work hard.  I\\'d help you.  I wouldn\\'t never complain.  All Iwant is just to be quiet.  I\\'d work hard.  Nobody\\'d never know.\"\"It\\'d be all over town by evenin\\' still.\"\"No, it wouldn\\'t.  I\\'d say I was a widow.  I\\'d say----\"\"Think o\\' your pop,\" sobbed Mrs. Denbigh.  \"Why, he\\'d--he\\'d kill you,Mary!\"  The mother shivered as she considered the wrath of the giant,whom hard work had hardened past the touch of all the tendereremotions.  \"He\\'d just beat you up an\\' throw you into the street foreverybody to see!\"  She half rose in a new anxiety.  \"Why, he\\'s onthe early shift, an\\' he might come here \\'most any minute.  Etta mightcome in, an\\' Sallie\\'ll be back from school soon.\"\"But, mom,\" Mary blindly persisted.  \"I\\'d work so hard!  I wouldn\\'tnever be cross.  I\\'d help you.  I\\'d do all the housework, an\\' youcould teach me to cook the way you do.\"\"We got to think o\\' Sallie yet,\" continued Mrs. Denbigh.  \"Every timeshe gets mad now she says she\\'ll run away like you done.  We got tothink o\\' her.  She\\'s a growin\\' girl, an\\' what\\'d it be to have youaround her?\"\"But, mom, I won\\'t hurt her.  Can\\'t I just stay an\\' work, an\\' washdishes, an\\' such things?  I wouldn\\'t mind washin\\' dishes\"--Marysmiled wanly--\"like I once did.\"\"An\\' then there\\'s Etta,\" said the mother, still busied in her ownconfusion.  \"She\\'s got a baby----\"\"A baby!\"  Mary\\'s heart leaped.\"Such a lovely baby girl----\"\"Can\\'t I----?  Oh, mom, can\\'t I just get a peep at it?\"\"How could you?--An\\' we have to think what it\\'d be for her if you washere an\\' she growed up.\"The prodigal choked with tears.\"Mom, mom!\" she pleaded.  \"How\\'d I hurt \\'em?  You don\\'t thinkI\\'d----?\"\"The town\\'d think so, an\\' the town\\'d tell \\'em so, too.  An\\' anyways,Mary, we\\'re poor, we\\'re dreadful poor.  The mill was shut down allsummer an\\' fall.  It\\'s only just started a\\'ready, an\\' it\\'s onlyworkin\\' half-time now.  We ain\\'t had money fer months still, an\\' nowit all goes fer old bills.  We couldn\\'t do it, even if we wanted to.\"For half an hour more Mary begged, but she begged in vain; and thoughthe mother ended by another attack of tears, and though the two wepttogether in each other\\'s arms, they knew that they were together forthe last time.\"Your clothes are so thin!\" quavered Mrs. Denbigh, with a patheticendeavor to sink her grief in practical anxiety.  \"You ain\\'t got nocoat, an\\' your feet are near on the ground still.\"Mrs. Denbigh had no money; there was literally not a cent in thehouse; but she unearthed from an old trunk, and pressed, for pawning,upon Mary, a heavy, old-fashioned gold bracelet, which had been awedding-present; and, though the daughter protested that she hadmoney enough to buy some clothes, the mother got her own coat uponthe daughter\\'s shoulders.They were still standing in the kitchen, as women awaiting thesummons of death, when first one steam-whistle and then another beganto call across the town.  It was noon, and the moment of puddlerDenbigh\\'s return.Without a word they walked, hand in hand, across the short back-yard,for Mary, it was tacitly agreed, must not risk an appearance upon thestreet in the neighborhood of her father\\'s house.  Without a word,Mrs. Denbigh\\'s knotted fingers opened the latch of the white-washedgate.  Without a word mother and daughter flung themselves into eachother\\'s arms again, and then, still in silence, Mary trudged away.She did not look back until she came to the first corner, and, whenshe got there, she saw her mother\\'s shrunken body still at the gate,the old hand waving, the aproned figure shaking with sobs.  It wasstill there when Mary reached the second corner; but when she turnedat the third, it was gone.Her pain was no longer poignant.  Grief had reached the mark whenceit passes to stupefaction; and Mary pursued her way as if her actionswere those suggested to a subject of hypnotic control.  In order toavoid the crowd at the station, she walked on up the alley, until thealley ended in an intersecting turnpike along which ran the trolleyline to the county-town.  She waited there, stolidly, for a car,mounted that, descended at the end of the road, and, after anotherdelay, climbed upon a train that would take her without change toJersey City.  For nearly twenty-four hours she had eaten nothing; butshe bought another small flask at the terminus, and, as theferry-boat glided between the creaking slips into the tossing water,she took a deep draught of whiskey.She walked to the stern and looked over the side.  It was night.Here gleamed the railway signs under which the boat had justpassed--the signs of those roads that, she had now discovered, endedas fatally for her freedom as if they had ended in an insurmountablewall.  Ahead towered the other walls, the black walls of that livingprison--that vast, malevolent, conscious jail--into which she hadonce gone with such a store of hopes whereof not one had ever beenfulfilled, of anticipated pleasures whereof not one had ever beentasted, and to which she must now, to serve out a life-sentence,return.Must she return?She looked up and down the dismal river, crowded with traffickingcraft, and she remembered that other river at home as she had seen iton the spring afternoon when she had played the truant from school.She remembered the swirling eddies across which the nearer hills hadbeen changing from brown to green; she remembered the descendingDonegal Valley, fresh with germinating life, the flowering shrubs,and the sap-wet trees along the shore, the scent of a warm April, andthe music of the Susquehanna.  These things she remembered, and thenshe looked again at the nearing city.Must she return?She touched the rail.  Over that lay certain escape.  The deck wasdeserted; the movement would be quick; the plunge----She leaned forward, she saw the leaping, greedy, icy waves, and, witha loud sob, staggered back to the bench that ran along the exteriorof the upper saloon.She could not do it.  With nothing but suffering and horrors to livefor, she could not put an end to life.  She was afraid of the cold;she was afraid of the struggle; she was afraid of the pang; she wasafraid of Death.  It was a new thing--Death; she had been afraid ofit ever since that morning of her awakening when the thought ofseeking it had first occurred to her.  Since her first crossing ofthis water, her experiences had been a procession of new things, eachmore terrible than the last; she had come to dread the new, and thisnovelty of death she dreaded lest it should be the most terrible ofall.  Life, which had robbed her of everything else, had, at thislast, robbed her of the courage to quit it.Youth, hope, purity, strength, beauty, the ability to work, even lustand hate--all these were dead within her, dead beyond possibility ofresurrection.  If Max had only given her a child!  If he, or anyoneof the others, had only killed her!  But they had murdered Love, andthe only thing that lived in her was the fear of death.Out of the bitterness of her own heart, out of the abysses of her ownknowledge of things as they are, she saw much of the truth.  A raregood fortune had favored Katie Flanagan; but Mary, her parents, Roseand her girls, Carrie, Policeman Riley and Magistrate Dyker, evenAngel and Max--not one of them, well regarded, could be unequivocallycondemned.  They were all, preying or preyed upon, an inevitableresult.  They were but the types of millions everywhere.  New Yorkitself, with all its women-slaves and men-slaves, must be but anillustration of what the other cities of the world are and have been.No rescue of a slave could put an end to the slavery.  Something waswrong; but what that something was, or how it was ever to be maderight, she could not guess.  She knew only that, down the years,wherever walked the great god Poverty, that great god ledProstitution by the hand.Finally comprehending, if unable to formulate, these things, at teno\\'clock that night Mary Denbigh, remembering what Philip Beekman hadtold her, rang the doorbell of a familiar house and faced what shewould once have feared more than death--she faced complacent,untroubled, prosperous, and protected Rose Légère.The woman, still the good-natured woman of the brewery-calendar, cutshort Mary\\'s flow of apologies.\"Ferget it,\" she said.  \"It don\\'t matter what you did.  You didn\\'tknow any better.  Here: just take this ten dollars and tell me whatelse I can do for you.\"And Mary pushed the money away.\"I don\\'t want that,\" she said.  \"I want--oh, Miss Rose, won\\'t youplease take me back?\"But Rose, surveying the human ruin before her, shook, verypositively, her masses of yellow hair.\"No,\" she answered, \"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t do that.  It wouldn\\'t begood business.  You see, the life\\'s got you, Violet: you\\'re all in.\"_EDITOR\\'S NOTE__The facts presented in the \"House of Bondage\" are so startling as toseem incredible.  They are, however, well known to those who havebecome familiar with the problem of the social evil, and can beduplicated indefinitely from court records, the findings of variousinvestigating bodies, such as the Congressional Commission, whosereport on this subject is known as Senate Document No. 196, ImportingWomen for Immoral Purposes, being a partial report from theImmigration Commission on the Importation and Harboring of Women forImmoral Purposes, published December 10, 1909, a book entitled\"Panders and Their White Slaves,\" by Clifford G.

THOMAS C. O\\'SULLIVAN, Judge of the  Court of General Sessions.Sir:We, the members of the Additional Grand Jury for the January term,1910, respectfully present as follows:In the charge delivered to us by Your Honor on the 3rd day ofJanuary, 1910, Your Honor said:\"There have been spread broadcast in the public prints statementsthat the City of New York is a center or clearing house for anorganized traffic in women for immoral purposes, or what has come tobe known as the \\'white slave\\' traffic.  Some of these statements mayhave been published with ulterior motive and may have been meresensationalism, but some are said to be based upon officialinvestigation and charges made by persons who profess to haveknowledge of the fact.* * * * * * *\"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main objects:First, the procuring of women of previous chaste character, whothrough force, duress, or deceit are finally made to live lives ofprostitution; second, the procuring of women who are alreadyprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where theymay ply their trade.* * * * * * * *\"But the main object, gentlemen, which I desire you to keep in mindthroughout your investigation is the uncovering not alone of isolatedoffenses, but of an organization, if any such exists, for a trafficin the bodies of women.\"You should make your investigation sufficiently broad to cover notonly present conditions, but also conditions existing in the pastwithin the statute of limitations.\"I charge you that it is your duty to pursue this inquiry into everychannel open to you and to present to the court the facts found byyou.\"Pursuant to Your Honor\\'s instructions, we have made an investigationinto the matters referred to in Your Honor\\'s charge.  We have calledbefore our body every person whom we could find who we had reason tobelieve might have information on the subject.  Among others were thefollowing: a member of the National Immigration Commission assignedto investigate conditions relating to importing, seducing, anddealing in women in the City of New York; the author of an articlewhich appeared in _McClure\\'s Magazine_ for November, 1909, entitled\"The Daughters of the Poor\"; a former under sheriff in the County ofEssex, New Jersey; the President of the New York Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Children; the author of a pamphlet entitled\"The White Slave Traffic\"; a member of the New York State ImmigrationCommission appointed by Governor Hughes in 1908; a former PoliceCommissioner of the City of New York; detectives and other agentsespecially employed in connection with this investigation; membersand ex-members of the New York Independent Benevolent Association;witnesses in the specific cases presented to this Grand Jury, as wellas a number of other citizens.  In addition, the foreman, theDistrict Attorney and his Assistants, have interviewedrepresentatives of the following organizations:The Committee of Fourteen; its Research Committee;The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children;The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice;The Charity Organization Society;The Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor;The Committee on Amusements and Vacation Resources of Working Girls;The Society for Social and Moral Prophylaxis;The Florence Crittenden Mission;The New York Probation Association;The Headworkers of various Social Settlements;The Women\\'s Municipal League;The Society for the Prevention of Crime;The Bureau of Municipal Research.We also published in the daily press of this city on the 6th day ofMay the following:\"The Additional Grand Jury, sworn in in January by Judge O\\'Sullivanof the Court of General Sessions, was charged with the investigationof the truth or falsity of certain statements which had been publiclymade during the past few months to the effect that the City of NewYork is a center or clearing house for an organized traffic in womenfor immoral purposes, or what has come to be known as the\\'white-slave traffic.\\'\"Pursuant to this charge the Grand Jury has been seeking legalevidence on this subject from all available sources.  The informationwhich many citizens have volunteered to give has proved in most casesto be general rather than specific.\"Before closing its investigation the Grand Jury desires to announcepublicly that it will be glad to receive definite, specificinformation as to the existence in this county of any traffic inwomen for immoral purposes from any citizen or official or otherindividual who has such information.  Those who are willing to assistthe Grand Jury in its investigation are asked to call at the officeof James B. Reynolds, Assistant District Attorney, Criminal CourtBuilding (within the next week).  It will save the time of manyindividuals and of Mr. Reynolds if only those appear who are willingand able to present facts regarding the specific matter above stated.\"On behalf of the Additional January Grand Jury.  \"JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, JR.,      \"Foreman.\"As a part of this investigation evidence has been presented to us andwe have found 54 indictments:22 for rape;16 for abduction;10 for maintaining disorderly houses, 7 of which were Raines-LawHotels;6 for the violation of Section 2460 of the Penal Law, entitled\"Compulsory Prostitution of Women.\"We have found no evidence of the existence in the County of New Yorkof any organization or organizations, incorporated or otherwise,engaged as such in the traffic in women for immoral purposes, norhave we found evidence of an organized traffic in women for immoralpurposes.It appears, on the other hand, from indictments found by us and fromthe testimony of witnesses that a trafficking in the bodies of womendoes exist and is carried on by individuals acting for their ownindividual benefit, and that these persons are known to each otherand are more or less informally associated.We have also found that associations and clubs, composed mainly orwholly of those profiting from vice, have existed, and that one suchassociation still exists.  These associations and clubs are analogousto commercial bodies in other fields, which, while not directlyengaged in commerce, are composed of individuals all of whom asindividuals are so engaged.The \"incorporated syndicates\" and \"international bands\" referred toin published statements, we find to be such informal relations ashave just been spoken of, while the \"international headquarters,\"\"clearing houses\" and \"pretentious clubhouses\" mentioned are cafés orother so-called \"hang-outs\" where people interested in the variousbranches of the business resort.  These and the houses ofprostitution are also referred to as \"markets.\"The \"dealers\" and \"operators\" are the so-called \"pimps\" and\"procurers,\" the \"pimp\" being referred to as the \"retailer\" and themanager of houses as the \"wholesaler.\"The only association composed mainly or wholly of those profitingfrom vice, of the present existence of which we have evidence, is theNew York Independent Benevolent Association, organized in this cityin 1894 and incorporated in 1896.  This association has had anaverage membership of about 100.  Its alleged purpose is to assistits members in case of illness, to give aid in case of death, and toassure proper burial rites.After an exhaustive investigation into the activities of theassociation and of its members we find no evidence that theassociation as such does now or has ever trafficked in women, butthat such traffic is being or has been carried on by various membersas individuals.  We find that the members of this association arescattered in many cities throughout the United States.  From thetestimony adduced it appears probable that the social relations ofthe members and the opportunity thereby afforded of communicatingwith one another in various cities have facilitated the conduct oftheir individual business.On one occasion where a member was convicted of maintaining adisorderly house and a fine of $l,000 was imposed upon him in theCity of Newark, New Jersey, the association voted $500 for his aid.On another occasion in the City of Newark, New Jersey, where severalof the members of the association were arrested on the charge ofkeeping and maintaining disorderly houses, and one member was inprison, the then President went to Newark, declared to the UnderSheriff that he was the President of the New York IndependentBenevolent Association, and entered into negotiations with theauthorities in Newark on behalf of the members who had been arrested.We have, however, no evidence of any such instance in the County ofNew York.It appears from the testimony of various members and ex-members ofthe said association that its membership is almost entirely composedof persons who are now or have been engaged in the operation ofdisorderly houses or who are living or have lived directly orindirectly upon the proceeds of women\\'s shame.  None of thesewitnesses, in answer to specific questions, could name more than oneor two present or past members whose record did not show them to havelived at some time upon the proceeds of prostitution in one form oranother.  They claim, however, that all members who have beenconvicted of a crime are expelled from the organization when theproof of that fact has been submitted, the offense apparently beingnot the commission of a crime, but conviction.  It would appear thatthis procedure is for the purpose of protecting the individual ifpossible, and, failing in that, of freeing the association fromcriticism.Finding no evidence of an organized traffic in women, but of atraffic carried on by individuals, we have made a special and carefulinvestigation along this line.  Owing to the publicity given to theinquiry at its inception, it has been difficult to get legal evidenceof the actual purchase and sale of women for immoral purposes, andour investigators have been informed in different quarters that anumber of formerly active dealers in women had either temporarilygone out of business or had transferred their activities to othercities.  However, five self-declared dealers in women had agreed uponvarious occasions to supply women to our agents, but because of theirextreme caution and the fear aroused by the continued sitting of thisGrand Jury, these promises were fulfilled in only two instances, ineach of which two girls were secured for our agents at a price, inthe one case of $60 each and in the other of $75 each.  Indictmentshave been found against these two persons; one pleaded guilty and theother was convicted on trial.All of these parties boasted to our investigators of their extensivelocal and interstate operations in the recent past.  Theyspecifically mentioned the cities to which they had forwarded womenand described their operations as having at that time been free fromdanger of detection.Our investigators also testified as to the methods and means used bythese people in replenishing the supply of women and in entrappinginnocent girls.Quoting again from Your Honor\\'s charge:\"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main objects:First, the procuring of women of previous chaste character, whothrough force, duress, or deceit are finally made to live lives ofprostitution; second, the procuring of women who are alreadyprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where theymay ply their trade.\"Under the first heading, namely, the procuring of women of previouschaste character, we find the most active force to be the so-called\"pimp.\"  There are in the County of New York a considerable andincreasing number of these creatures who live wholly or in part uponthe earnings of girls or women who practice prostitution.  Withpromises of marriage, of fine clothing, of greater personalindependence, these men often induce girls to live with them andafter a brief period, with threats of exposure or of physicalviolence, force them to go upon the streets as common prostitutes andto turn over the proceeds of their shame to their seducers, who livelargely, if not wholly, upon the money thus earned by their victims.This system is illustrated in an indictment and conviction where thedefendant by such promises induced a girl of fifteen to leave herhome and within two weeks put her on the streets as a commonprostitute.We find also that these persons ill-treat and abuse the women withwhom they live and beat them at times in order to force them togreater activity and longer hours of work on the streets.  This isillustrated in the case of another defendant who was indicted andconvicted for brutally slashing with a knife the face of \"his girl\"and leaving her disfigured for life, merely because she was no longerwilling to prostitute herself for his benefit.In this connection mention should be made of the moving picture showsas furnishing to this class of persons an opportunity for leadinggirls into a life of shame.  These shows naturally attract largenumbers of children, and while the law provides that no child underthe age of sixteen shall be allowed to attend them unaccompanied byparent or guardian, it is a fact, as shown by the number of arrestsand convictions that the law is frequently violated.  Evidence uponwhich indictments have been found and convictions subsequentlysecured, has been given which shows that, in spite of the activitiesof the authorities in watching these places, many girls owe theirruin to frequenting them.  An instance of the above is the case of adefendant indicted by this Grand Jury and convicted before YourHonor, where three girls met as many young men at a Harlem movingpicture show.  At the end of the performance, the young men weretaken by an employee of the place through a door in the rear into aconnecting building--used as a fire exit for the moving pictureshow--where they met the girls and all passed the night together.The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has furnishedstatistics showing that since the 13th day of December, 1906, 33cases of rape and seduction originated in moving picture shows, insome instances the perpetrators being the employees of the shows.It is not the purpose of this reference to bring an indictmentagainst the moving picture show, which under proper restrictions maybe an important and valuable educational and recreative factor, butrather to point out possible dangers inherent in performances carriedon in the darkness and the importance of the observance of safeguardsby parents or guardians, and of the strict enforcement of the law forthe protection of children.Under the second heading in that portion of Your Honor\\'s chargequoted above, which refers to the procuring of women who are alreadyprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where theymay ply their trade, the Grand Jury has made a special study of theclass of disorderly houses commonly known as \"Raines-Law Hotels,\" thechief business of many of which is to provide a place where women ofthe streets may take their customers.  The testimony given shows thatgirls who brought their patrons to certain hotels of this class wereallowed rebates on the amount charged their patrons for rooms.  Uponthe evidence brought before us, indictments were found against sevenof the most notorious of these hotels.The abuse which has grown up in the conversion of the so-calledmassage and manicure parlor into a disorderly house, frequently ofthe most perverted kind, has received our careful study under thissame heading.  A special investigation has been made of some 125massage and manicure parlors, in this county.  Less than half ofthese establishments were found to be equipped for legitimatepurposes, most of them being nothing but disorderly houses.  Theoperators in such places had no knowledge of massage treatment, andin certain cases where certificates of alleged massage instituteswere on the walls of the premises they frankly admitted that they hadno training in massage and did not even know the persons whosesignatures appeared on the certificates.In view of the above, it would seem important that these parlorsshould be licensed by the Health Department of the city and that alloperators in them should also have a license from some approvedhealth or medical authority, and further, that proper supervisionshould be exercised to insure their operation for the legitimatepurposes for which they are licensed.The spreading of prostitution in its various forms from thewell-known disorderly house into apartment and tenement housespresents a very grave danger to the home.  It is inevitable thatchildren who have daily evidence of the apparent comfort, ease, andoftentimes luxury in which women of this class live should not onlybecome hardened to the evil, but be easily drawn into the life.  Theexisting laws for the suppression of this vice in apartment andtenement houses should be most rigorously enforced and if necessaryadditional legislation enacted.But of the evils investigated under this head, the most menacing isthe so-called \"pimp\" who, as already stated, while often active inseducing girls, is, to what seems to be an increasing extent, livingon the earnings of the professional prostitute, constantly driven byhim to greater activity and more degrading practices.We do not find that these persons are formally organized, but itwould appear that the majority of the women of the street, as well asmany of those who practice prostitution in houses or flats, arecontrolled by them and usually pay their entire earnings to them.They prescribe the hours and working places for these women, assistthem in getting customers, protect them from interference whenpossible, and when the women are arrested do what they can to procuretheir release.  While \"their women\" are at work, they spend much oftheir time in saloons and other resorts where they gather socially.Although operating individually, their common interest leads them tocoöperate for mutual protection or for the recovery of women who maydesert them, and for the maintenance of their authority over theirparticular women.  It is an unwritten law among these men that theauthority of the individual over the woman or women controlled by himis unquestioned by his associates to whatever extreme it may becarried.To obtain a conviction against one of this class is most difficult,for through fear or personal liking, \"his woman\" is loath to become awitness against him, and without her evidence conviction is almostimpossible.Whatever one may think of the woman who adopts the profession of aprostitute by choice, all must agree that the man who in cold bloodexploits a woman\\'s body for his own support and profit is vile anddespicable beyond expression.  Only through the arousing of anintelligent and determined public sentiment which will back up theforces of law in their effort to ferret out and bring to justice themembers of this debased class, is there hope of stamping out thosevilest of human beings found to-day in the leading cities of this andother lands.--------In view of the foregoing we recommend:1. That no effort be spared in bringing to justice the so-called\"pimp.\"  When the character and prevalence of these creatures aremore fully realized and public sentiment aroused regarding them, theinadequate punishment now imposed should be increased and everylegitimate means devised and put into execution to exterminate them.2. That the existing laws be more rigidly enforced to safeguard thepatrons of the moving picture shows, and that parents and guardiansexercise more careful supervision over their children in connectionwith their attendance upon these shows.3. That vigorous efforts be made to minimize the possibility of theRaines-Law Hotel becoming a disorderly house, and that wherenecessary proper supervision and inspection looking toward that endbe provided.4. That the so-called massage and manicure parlors be put under thecontrol of the Health Department; that a license from this departmentbe required for their operation; that certificates be granted tooperators only by some approved medical authority, and that propermeasures be taken to enforce these laws.5. That the laws relating to prostitution in apartment and tenementhouses be rigidly enforced, and that the present laws be supplementedif necessary.6. That a commission be appointed by the Mayor to make a carefulstudy of the laws relating to and the methods of dealing with thesocial evil in the leading cities of this country and of Europe, witha view to devising the most effective means of minimizing the evil inthis city.

       "'THE HOUSE OF BONDAGEI\"AS IF THE SPRING WERE ALL YOUR OWN\"The local weather-prophets--the cape-coated Mennonites and thebearded Amishmen, who came into the town to market--had said, withchoral unanimity, that the spring would be brief and sudden, and thesummer parching and intense.Already, though April had but dawned, the pink arbutus had bloomedand withered, and the pale first violets were peeping, purple andfragrant, among the lush grass of the front yards on Second Street.The annual oriole was a full fortnight ahead of his time in openinghis summer-house in the hickory-tree on the Southwarks\\' lawn; and upin the droning study-room of the high-school, where all the windowswere wide to the lazy sunlight, Miss England had begun, this week, todirect the thoughts of her dwindling senior-class toward the subjectsof their graduation essays.Swaying with the easy, languid grace of an unstudied young animal,Mary Denbigh, the morning-session ended, turned from the graveledwalk before the school-grounds into the little town\\'s chiefthoroughfare.Nobody had ever called her pretty, but her light serge skirt had thatday been lengthened to her ankles, and Mary was wholly conscious ofthe new tokens of her growth.  Lithe, strong-limbed and firm-bodied,of peasant stock and peasant vigor, youth and health and the opencountry air were not factors sufficiently unfamiliar to combine in acharm that would attract admiration in her own community.  Only ajaded city-gaze--and a well-trained city-gaze at that--would haveseen in the blue eyes, the red mouth, the straight nose, pink cheeks,and abundant russet hair, any promise worthy of fulfillment,--couldhave detected the flower in the bud; and that such a gaze should, onthis day of all days, have been leveled in the girl\\'s direction was,perhaps, only one of those grim jests of a Fate that loves to playupon the harmony between man and nature, and that here observed thecoming of a human spring that must be brief and sudden, a humansummer parching and intense.The usual group of idle residents and idling commercial drummers weresitting at the plate-glass window of the hotel as she went by, butthe girl did not see them.  Passing among objects of longfamiliarity, she saw, in fact, nothing until, in a side-street, sheheard a rapid step behind her, was covered by an approaching shadowand, half-turning, found someone, a stranger, at her side.\"How d\\'y\\'do, liddle girl?\"Mary looked up; but she was quite too startled to observe anythingsave that the speaker--she could not have told whether he were man orboy--was at once dark and rosy, smiling and serious, hat in hand,and, beyond all speculation, no citizen of her own borough.\"I don\\'t know you,\" she said.She flushed quickly, and strode forward.  It was, she knew, nouncommon thing for the girls of her acquaintance to be \"picked up,\"as they called the process, by some fellow-townsman that had neverbeen formally presented to them; but the process was, as she alsoknew, one that lost its propriety when extended to aliens.The present alien was, nevertheless, not easily to be dismissed.  Hefell into her gait, and walked facilely beside her.\"I beg your _par_don,\" he said in the humblest and mostunobjectionable tones.  \"I don\\'t mean to be _rude_ to you, honest, Idon\\'t.  I\\'m a traveling-man, you see----\"Mary was striding rapidly ahead, her full mouth now drawn firm, herblue eyes fixed on the vanishing-point.\"I don\\'t care what you are,\" she answered.\"All righd,\" he pleaded.  \"All I vant now is a chanc\\'t to _exblain_.I\\'ve chust started out traveling for my fader, who\\'s a big distillerin N\\'York.  I\\'ve got to stay in this hole for a vhile, un\\' I\\'m notused to the _bees_ness, un\\' I\\'m lonesome, un\\' I only vondered if youvouldn\\'t go vith me to a moving-picture show, or something, thisevening.\"The best way to deal with such a situation is a way that is easiestfor the inexperienced and the unpolished.  Mary was both.  For thefirst time since he had begun to walk beside her, she now, coming toa defiant stop, faced her annoyer.\"I don\\'t know you,\" she repeated.  \"I\\'ve told you that onc\\'t, andyou\\'d better not make me tell you any more still.  I live the seconddoor round the coming corner, and my pop is a puddler an\\' weighs twohundred and ten pounds!\"Again she wheeled and again resumed her homeward march; and this timeshe walked alone.  If she heard, dimly, behind her a confused murmurof response, she did not hesitate to learn whether the words wereexpressions of further apology or new-born dismay, and when she ran,flushed and panting, up the three wooden steps to the two-story brickhouse that was her home, though she could not then deny herself onebackward glance, that glance revealed to her only an empty corner.The pursuit had ended.She flung open the light door that was never locked by day, walkeddown the short, darkened hall, past the curtain of the equallydarkened parlor, through the dining-room with its pine table coveredby a red cotton cloth, and so into the small, crowded kitchen, whereher mother fretted and clattered above the highly polished range.Mrs. Denbigh was a little Pennsylvania-German woman, whom a sternreligion and a long life of hard work had not intellectuallyenlarged.  In spite of the fact that she had borne eight children, ofwhom Mary was the seventh, her sympathies had failed to broaden, andher equally religious and equally hard-working Welsh husband usedoften to remark to her, during his one-monthly evening ofintoxication, that he was glad indeed she was to have no moreprogeny, since, somehow or other, she \"seemed to git wuss temperedwith every innocent youngling as koom to \\'un.\"  Whether thiscriticism was or was not precise, it is at least true that muchdrudgery had not improved the weary woman\\'s temper; that the longyears before her husband rose to his present wages--years duringwhich his wife had not only kept a house and reared a family, but hadalso added to the communal income by night-work as a dress-maker--hadleft her gray and stooped and hatchet-faced; and that, though of arace in which the maternal instinct runs almost to a passion, herpatience with her remaining pair of home-biding children wasfrequently fragile and short.Just now she looked up, a spoon in one hand and a pan in the other,her forehead damp, as always, with sweat, and her harassed eyesmomentarily bright with anger.\"Where on earth have you been, anyways?\" she shrilly inquired of Mary.The girl\\'s face instantly hardened from the excitement of her recentadventure to the sullenness behind which she always took refuge inthese more usual domestic crises.  What she might have confessed hadshe come home to a less overworked mother, it is, obviously, vain toconjecture; what she actually did was to lock within her breast thestory that had been trembling on her red lips, and what she repliedto Mrs. Denbigh\\'s question was an ungracious:\"Been at school.  Where d\\'you think?\"The mother straightened up as far as her long-stooped shoulders wouldpermit.\"Think?\" she echoed.  \"I guess I can guess still where you was.\\'Less you was kep\\' in, you had ought t\\' been home five minutes ago,an\\' nobody\\'s kep\\' in only five minutes.  You\\'ve been flirtin\\' withsome idiot of a boy on the street-corner yet--that\\'s about whatyou\\'ve been doin\\'!\"It was a random shot, and one fired from no previous knowledge, butthe girl at once realized that, had any neighbor chanced to see whathad actually occurred, this parental construction would appear tohave some foundation in fact.  The thought was enough to seal thelocked gate in her breast.\"That ain\\'t so!\" she said, with childish fury.  \"I come straighthome, like I always do.  If you want me to help more with the workthan I do help, why don\\'t you let me quit school?  I don\\'t want to goany more, anyhow.\"There are some families in which the passing of the lie is no suchuncommon or serious offense, and the Denbigh _ménage_ was one ofthem.  It was, therefore, upon the latter portion of Mary\\'s speechthat her mother, at this time, seized.\"You\\'ll go to school as long as your pop and me say you must!\" sheretorted.\"You let our Etta quit when she was in the grammar school,\"expostulated Mary, with an appeal to the precedent of thesuccessfully married sister, who was now a next-door neighbor.  \"Youlet her quit then, and now I\\'m in the high.\"Had Mrs. Denbigh\\'s rejoinder been in accordance with the facts, shewould have said that all she wanted to do was to give her daughter asmuch of an education as was compatible with the proper conduct of theDenbigh domestic economy.  But tired women are no more apt to indulgein analytical exposition than are tired men, and so it chanced thather next speech, accompanied by a gesture that raised thecooking-spoon aloft, was a torrent of words unexpectedly interrupted.\"In the high?\" she repeated.  \"Well, I know where you\\'ll be in oneminute, still, if you don\\'t right away----\"She brought the spoon forward with a mighty swoop, but its parabola,in crossing the stove, sent it into violent contact with the pot thatheld the stew destined for the noon dinner.  The pot was balanced onthe edge of an aperture in the stove whence the lid had been removed.The vessel fell, and its contents belched upon the burning coals.Mrs. Denbigh gave one look at the steaming ruin, and then seized thealready retreating Mary.  The girl\\'s struggles, her cries, thedignity of the newly lengthened skirt, avail nothing.  A dozen timesthe mother\\'s arm descended in stinging castigation, and then shehurried her daughter into the hall.\"You git right back to school!\" she ordered.  \"I don\\'t care if you\\'rea half-hour early--you\\'re mostly late enough.  You\\'ve spoiled yourown dinner and mine and little Sallie\\'s, so you don\\'t git nothin\\' toeat still till evening.  You\\'ll go to school, and you\\'ll keep ongoin\\' till your pop an\\' me tells you to quit!\"Mary looked at the woman without a word, and then, still without aword, passed through the front door and banged it behind her.But she did not walk in the direction of the school; she was notgoing to school.  The rebel-spirit of youth choked her, and turnedher feet, almost without will of her own, toward the river.She crossed the railroad tracks, came to the disused towpath andfollowed it for a mile beyond the town.  Far westward she went,\"walking,\" as she would have said, \"her madness down,\" and, hungrythough she now was, she did not rest until at last, as late as threeo\\'clock in the afternoon, she sat on a rock at the point where theSusquehanna curves between the sheer precipice of Chicques on theLancaster County side and the hooded nose of the high hill they callthe Point, upon the other.The flood of rebellion had ceased, but a steady and enduring streamof resolution remained.Across the sweep of eddies she saw the nearer hills already sheddingthe browns and blacks of winter\\'s bared limbs and pine branches forthe tenderer green of a gentler season.  The cultivated portions ofthe summits were already rich with coming life.  Behind her rolledthe Donegal Valley, where the crops were even then germinating.Birds were mating in the sap-wet trees beside the water, and from theflowering seeds there came the subtle, poignant scent of a warm April.Something--something new and nameless and wonderful--rose in herthroat and left her heart hammering an answer to the new world aroundher.  She was glad--glad in spite of all her anger and her hunger;glad that she had not told her mother of the boy--for he must havebeen a boy--whom she had, after all, so needlessly reprimanded; butglad, above everything else, for some reason, for some intoxicationthat she might neither then nor ever after completely understand.Her cheeks glowed a deeper pink; her blue eyes glistened; she openedher red mouth to the seductive sun and, with a sweep of her firmhands, flung loose her russet hair to the breeze.  Looking out at thedistant fields, she sprang to her feet again and walked, swaying withthe easy, languid grace of an unstudied young animal.The fields reminded her of the rural prophets.  It was evident, shethought, that they were right: this year\\'s was to be a spring briefand sudden, a summer parching and intense.IIA DEED OF TRUSTMary Denbigh could not remember the day when the holy estate ofmatrimony had not been held up to her by others as the whole destinyof woman and had not presented itself as the natural, the easy, thesole path of escape from filial servitude.She belonged, as has been intimated, to a race in which motherhood isan instinctive passion and an economic necessity, and she was borninto a class in which not to marry is socially shameful andmaterially precarious.  When she was very small, her own dolls wereher own children and her playmates\\' dolls her children-in-law, and,when she grew older, she had always before her the sedulouslymaintained illusion of emancipation worn by those girls, but a fewyears her seniors, who had given up the drudgery of childhood, whichshe hated, for the drudgery of wifehood, which they loftilyconcealed.  A young wife was a superior being, whose condition wasnot at all to be judged by the known condition of one\\'s mother, andall the other and more intimate relations of marriage remained, tothe uninitiate, a charmed mystery.  If it seems strange to us thatthis mystery and this innocence remained to Mary at sixteen, thereflection rests not upon her from whom the secret kept its secrecy,but upon us to whom the innocence appears remarkable.From a house that exacted everything and forgave nothing, a narrowhouse, which she could not see as simply an inevitable result ofconditions as wide as the world, the girl looked out to thatwonderful house next door where her sister had, only three yearsbefore, been taken as a bride.  This sister was now an elegantperson, who said \"fore-head,\" \"of-ten,\" and \"a-gain,\" but Mary couldremember Etta, in gingham frock and apron, performing the tasks thatwere now enforced upon Mary herself.  And she could now observe--as,indeed, her sister\\'s wholly conscious pride well intended that sheshould observe--Etta in clothes that were beyond the reach of anunmarried daughter of Owen Denbigh; Etta going to dances forbidden toa Denbigh maid.  When she climbed reluctantly to bed at ten o\\'clock,Etta\\'s lights blazed always wide awake, and when she rose in the grayof the morning, Etta\\'s shutters were luxuriously closed.Every dawn Mary must pack her father\\'s dinner-bucket, as Etta used topack it, before Owen started for the mill.  That done, and thehurried breakfast eaten, she must make her own bed and wash thedishes before she set out for school.  At noon there were moredishes, and only every other evening, before sitting down to detestedstudy by the kerosene lamp in the dining-room, was she relieved ofstill more dish-washing by the growing, and apparently too favored,younger sister, Sallie.The evening that followed Mary\\'s truant walk along the river was oneof those when she should have been granted this modicum of relief,but now, after the brief five o\\'clock supper, tow-headed Sallie setup a wail as the table was cleared.\"What\\'s the matter with you now?\" demanded Mrs. Denbigh, her harassedeyes blinking in the lamplight, and her hatchet-face more thancommonly sharp.\"I ain\\'t feelin\\' good,\" said Sallie.  \"I\\'m tired; I\\'m sick; I don\\'twant to wash no dishes.\"Mrs. Denbigh shot a glance through the double-doorway to the litteredparlor; but the face of her unattentive husband was hidden behind thecrinkling sheets of the _Daily Spy_, gripped by one great, grimyfist, while the stubby forefinger of the other hand spelled out theshort syllables of the personal-column, facetiously headed \"OurCard-Basket.\"  His huge bulk bulged over all the edges of theuncomfortable patent armchair in which he was sitting: a picture ofgorged contentment, there was as yet no help to be expected from him.It was Mary, experienced in such attacks, who made ready to defendthe law.\"You ain\\'t sick,\" she declared.\"I am, too!\" sniffed Sallie.  \"I\\'m awful sick!\"\"Get out: you et more\\'n I did.  You just want to make me do the work,an\\' I won\\'t, \\'cause it\\'s your turn.  So there!\"Mary\\'s homecoming had, as it happened, not been the signal for arenewal of hostilities between her mother and herself.  The formerhad just then been too hard at work to have either energy or thoughtin that direction, and throughout the evening meal the girl haddeemed it wise to maintain a reticence calculated to keep her in thedomestic background.  Now, however, she had impulsively come forward,and the step at once brought her to Mrs. Denbigh\\'s attention.\"After what you done this noon,\" she said to Mary, \"you\\'d better keepyour mouth shut.  Go and wash them dishes!\"But Mary knew that she had now gone too far to retreat.\"It wasn\\'t my fault the stew was spilled,\" she protested; \"andanyhow, you did lick me onc\\'t for that.  Sallie just wants to shoveher work off on me.\"\"I don\\'t,\" blubbered Sallie.  \"I\\'ll do \\'em some evenin\\' when it\\'syour turn.\"\"Yes,\" Mary sneered, \"I know how you will.\"\"I will--I will--I will so!\"Sallie\\'s voice rose to a shrill shriek, and then suddenly broke offin the middle of a note: there was a sound of elephantine stirringfrom the parlor, and the feared master of the house, moved at lastfrom his lethargy, rolled into the double doorway and seemed nearlyto block it.One of the young reporters of _The Spy_ had once remarked--not inprint--that Owen Denbigh resembled nothing so much as the stern of anarmored cruiser seen from a catboat.  How much of the covering of hispowerful frame was fat and how much muscle is matter for conjecture;his life in the iron mills had certainly given him a strength atleast approaching the appearance, and had blackened his large hands,reddened his big face, and grayed his bristling hair and his fiercelyflaring mustache.\"Whad\\'s ahl this devil\\'s racket?\" he shouted, in the voice he used intriumphing over the turmoil of the puddling-furnace.Both children quailed before him, each prepared regardless of itsmerits, for acquittal or condemnation, as he might decide the issue.Even Mrs. Denbigh drew back and set her lips to silence.The giant raised a threatening hand.\"Be ye ahl gone deef?\" he demanded.  \"Whad\\'s ahl this devil\\'s racketfur?\"In a panic of self-preservation, the two girls began at once toclamor forth their woes.\"Sallie won\\'t wash the dishes!\" cried Mary.\"I\\'m sick,\" sobbed Sarah, \"an\\' mom says Mary must wash \\'em becauseshe upset the stew this noon-time!\"In the merits of any case brought before him, the household Solomonwas as little interested as if he had been the judge of a law-court.His years of overwork had limited his sense of a just division oftoil among others, and his long oppression by task-masters had madehimself a merciless task-master.  Like the men that had driven him,he delighted most in driving those who were the hardest to drive.Sallie was too young to furnish appreciable resistance, but in theawakening Mary he now saw something that approached worthyopposition.  He turned first to his wife.\"Did you tell \\'er,\" he inquired, his stubby forefinger leveled atMary--\"did you tell \\'er to wash \\'un?\"Mrs. Denbigh bowed her sweating forehead in timid assent.Then the father looked again at the offender.\"Wash \\'un!\" he ordered, and marched back to his parlor, his armchair,and his evening paper.Mary knew her father too well not to know also the price ofdisobedience.  Sullenly, but without hesitation, she retreated to thelittle kitchen and took up her uncongenial task.Girlhood, then, must be denied much of its claim to recreation; thesocial machine was pitiless.  Young life was a period of menialservice from which the sole escape was marriage, whether to strangeror to friend.  That a stranger should harm her was, to Mary--as it isto most girls of her age and environment--an idea unentertained:strangers were too few, and the world of moral fact too closely shutand guarded.  Boys she had always been cautioned against in vaguegeneralities; but she understood that they were prohibited becausetheir company was a delectable luxury reserved for older andmarriageable girls whose younger sisters were needed only to help inthe household tasks.Rebellion once more reddened her heart--rebellion, as she thought,against her own particular condition, but the old rebellion,actually, that burns, at one time or another, in every heart: therevolt of the individual, more or less conscious of itsindividuality, against the conditions that are combined to crush it.She poured the water from the heavy iron tea-kettle into the tindishpan with a quick anger that was not eased when two or three ofthe scalding drops leaped back against her bared, round arms.  Sheflung the home-boiled soap after the water, and she clattered thedishes as loudly as she dared.  Through the window--her soul hot withthe sense of the injustice done her--she could see the happy lightsin Etta\\'s house, and, her hands deep in the greasy fluid, it came toher suddenly that she had been a fool to neglect--torepudiate--to-day what might have been the golden chance to such anestate as her sister\\'s.She had heard the protesting Sarah sent to bed; had heard her motherreturn to the parlor with the sewing-basket, and, finally, as she wasputting away the last of the dishes in the china-closet in thedining-room, she caught the voices of both of her parents.Dimly glimpsed from the small apartment beyond, she knew the scenewell enough to reconstruct it perfectly.  The crowded little parlorwas like a hundred others in the immediate neighborhood, amathematical result of the community of which it was a part.  Therewere the two front windows with the horse-hair chairs before eachand, between them, the marble-top table bearing the family Bible.There was the gilt mirror over the gorgeously lambrequinedmantelpiece, which was littered with a brass clock,dried-grass-bearing yellow vases, stiff photographs of dead ormarried younger Denbighs, and \"memorial cards\" with illegible giltlettering upon a ground of black.  Close by the cabinet-organ on oneside and the green sofa on the other--the sofa adorned with a lace\"tidy\" that would never remain neatly in its place--her father andmother sat, separated by the purple-covered center-table, their gazeinterrupted by the tall glass case that contained the bunch of white_immortelles_ from the grave of their eldest son.Mrs. Denbigh was finishing, it seemed, the narrative of the town\\'slatest scandal.\"I never knowed Mrs. Drumbaugh was that soft-hearted,\" the mother wassaying.  \"Nobody in town was fooled over the reason for why herJennie went away, an\\' yet here the girl comes back a\\'ready, and Mrs.Drumbaugh, church-member though she is, takes her into the houseag\\'in--her an\\' her baby along with her.\"What was it in the words that brought Mary to a sudden pause?  Hermother had always been, like most drudges, a gossip, and had sought,in repeating scandal about her acquaintances, that relief fromdrudgery which she knew how to obtain only by this second-hand thrillof evil.  The girl had heard and disregarded the telling of many sucha tale, and yet, to-night, she stood there first listening inuncomprehending horror to the narrative and then awaiting theinevitable paternal comment upon it.\"Tuke \\'er bahk, hey?\" rumbled Owen Denbigh.  \"Well, ef she bay soocha fule, she deserves the scandal ov\\'t.  Thank God no youngling o\\'ourn ever went the devil\\'s way.  I hahve ahlways bin sure what I\\'d doto \\'un ef she did, though.\"He paused a moment, as if to have his wife inquire as to the terriblepunishment that he had reserved for such an error, and then, as noinquiry was forthcoming, he gave his statement at any rate, with allthe cold ferocity of a Judge Jeffries pronouncing sentence.\"Bay \\'un thirty year old an\\' noot another sin ag\\'in \\'un,\" hedeclared, \"I would beat \\'un within a bare inch o\\' \\'er deeth, an\\' turn\\'un oot to live the life \\'un had picked fur herself!\"The whole intent of that speech Mary was incapable of comprehending,but she understood enough to tremble and then to fan to destructivefury the fire of her rebellion.  Of a sudden, the atmosphere of thehouse had become unendurable.  She was gasping like a sparrow under abell-glass.Stealthily she crept into the hall.  Carefully she took her coat andfaded hat from the rack.  Very gently she opened the front door andstole into the street.  She felt dumbly that the world was wrong,that youth should not have to work, and that to seize the fruit ofpleasure should not be matter far punishment, but for congratulation.I do not think that she meant to pass by the hotel that evening.  Ido not believe that most of us, in such moments, are actuated anymore by motive than we are directed by discretion.  Nevertheless,when the clutch of her emotions had enough loosened from her throatto permit her to take account of her whereabouts, the time, and theplace, it was a quarter after six by the town-clock; Mary was justbefore the plate-glass window where the drummers sat, and, only aminute later, the stranger of the morning was again at her side.\"Von\\'t you chust say that you\\'re not _mad_ vith me?\" he was asking.She was so frightened that she was conscious of no other definitesensation, much less of any ordered thought or opinion; but shelooked fairly at him, and of what she saw she was immediately fullyaware.He was a young man, but the sort of young man that might be anywherefrom nineteen to thirty-two, because he had the figure and the faceof the former age and the eyes and the expression of the latter.  Thehair on his head was black and curly; though his hands were not theworking-hands with which Mary was best acquainted, they were almostcovered with a lighter down of the same growth; and through the paleolive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks shone the blue-black hint ofa wiry beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thick when he didnot smile and thin when he did, with teeth very white; and his grayglance had a penetrating calculation about it that made the girlinstinctively draw her coat together and button it.To his speech she could pay, just then, scarcely any attention,except to feel that its quick, thick quality, and its ictus on thevowels, denoted the foreigner; but his clothes were a marvel thatwould not be denied.  His coat and trousers of green were cut in theextreme of a fashion that was new to her; his brown plush hat wasturned far down on one side and far up on the other; his waistcoat,of purple striped by white, was held by large mother-of-pearlbuttons, and his shoes, long and pointed, were the color of lemons.Impulsively she had refused an answer to his first words; but theyoung man was a member of the persistent race, and speedily followedthe first speech with a second.\"Chust say the vord,\" he pleaded, \"und I von\\' bother you no more.  Ionly vanted to make myself _square_ vith you.\"Mary hesitated.  Something, she knew, she feared, but whether it wasthe man, herself, or the habit of obedience she could not tell.  Hewas polite, he was respectful; he came, it was clear, from a happierworld than her own--and, as against her own she was now in openrevolt, a certain parley with this visitor from an alien orb seemedlikely to constitute a fitting declaration of independence.Conditions had worked upon her to desperation, and the sameconditions, little as she guessed it, had, under the mask of chance,inevitably provided this avenue of protest.\"Oh,\" she said, \"I\\'m not mad at you, if that\\'s what you want to know.\"\"I\\'m glad of that,\" he easily answered, as they turned, quitenaturally, away from the main street.  \"But I thought you gonsideredme _fresh_.\"\"Well, I hadn\\'t never been introduced to you, you know.\"The young man laughed.\"I\\'ll introduce myself!\" said he.  \"My name\\'s Max Grossman--not myreal name, because I vas born in Hungary an\\' nobody could say my realname ofer here.  My fader is a big distiller in New York--he\\'s vorthhalf a million un\\' more: anybody\\'ll tell you about him.  \\'Und he\\'sput me on the road for him.\"This and much more he told her in the following minutes.  He drew atruly brilliant picture of his parental home, and, animadverting nowand then with scorn on the town in which he now found himself, hepainted in the highest colors the glory of Manhattan.New York, it appeared, was a city of splendid leisure.  Its entirefour millions of population spent their days in rest and their nightsin amusement.  There were the rumbling cable-cars, the roaringelevated trains, the subway expresses, which reached out and drew theBattery within twenty minutes of the Bronx.  There were the realitiesthat had been only vague magic names to this girl: the East Side, theBowery, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Waldorf.  Nobody went tobed before three o\\'clock in the morning, or woke before one in theafternoon.  Nobody was ugly and nobody was old.  There were no booksto study, no errands to run, no dishes to wash.  There were only thecabs and the taxis to ride in, the hundred theaters to see, the cafésand the music, Fifth Avenue with its palaces, and Broadway, fromThirty-fourth to Forty-third \"von big, yellow, happy electric lighd.\"She listened.  As he spoke, though she did not know it, the far-offorchestras were calling her, as if the sound of the city deafened herto all other sounds, as if the lights of New York blinded her to thelights of home.Her own story, as she in turn briefly told it to him, provided herwith the one touch of contrast needed to make the lure of the newdream complete, provided him with the one text necessary for theimplications he frankly wanted her to receive.  She was already sometropolitan that, when she agreed to go to the moving-picture show,she passed the portals of \"The Happy Hour,\" as the place wasoptimistically entitled, with a superior scorn for all that it had tooffer.The narrow hall was dark when they entered--Max pocketing the largeroll of yellow bills from which he had drawn the price of theiradmission--and, as they sat down, half-way toward the stage, therewas being shown, on the screen, the absurd adventures of a tramp, whoentered an ornate hotel grill-room and who, among wondering,well-dressed guests, was proceeding to order an elaborate meal.\"That\\'s the _As_tor,\" whispered Max, loudly.  \"I\\'d know id anyvheres.\"The pictured tramp was, of course, unable to pay his score, and,equally, of course, was pursued as he leaped through an open window.Max acted as Mary\\'s guide during the tableaux of the chase thatfollowed.  Now the quarry was darting among the congested traffic ofTimes Square; now he had clambered over the platform of aForty-second Street surface-car; now he was running up the steepstairway of the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" and now, the hunters close at hisheels, he was dashing along Thirty-fourth Street past the Waldorf,turning down toward the Park Avenue Hotel, and so, at last, wascaught at the nearby entrance to the subway.When the lights flared up at the conclusion of the little drama, Marysighed as if suddenly plunged from fairyland down to the real worldbelow.  And then the sigh changed to a gasp of fright: in the samerow, only six seats away, her sister Etta was sitting.The girl started to rise.\"Vhat\\'s wrong?\" asked the astonished Max.\"I must go.  Don\\'t come out with me.  Wait a minute, and then follow.I\\'ll be at the next corner up street.  That\\'s our Etta over there!\"But Max did not seem fully to comprehend the warning.  He rose withMary, and made some stir in doing it, so that, as the pair reachedthe aisle, Etta\\'s eyes were drawn in the direction of her sister andthe man.Mary, though she hastily turned her head, thought that she sawrecognition in this sudden glance.  She thought that she sawrecognition turn to amazement, and amazement to rebuke.  Instantly,there rose before her the reefs of ultimate domestic disaster.  WithMax in close attendance, she hurried to the door.Outside she did not speak until they had reached the comparativeseclusion of a less frequented street.  Then she turned hotly uponthe youth, whom she considered the cause of her peril.\"Why was you such a fool?\" she demanded.  \"Didn\\'t you hear me say foryou not to come out when I did?\"\"I didn\\'t understand you,\" Max humbly expostulated.  \"But vhatdifference does it make, anyvays?\"\"Difference?  Why, you were so blamed noisy that Etta looked roundan\\' seen me.  She\\'ll go straight home and tell pop I was here withyou.\"\"Vell,\" protested Max, \"it\\'s not seven o\\'clock yet, und I\\'m noteatin\\' you, vas I?\"\"That don\\'t matter.  You don\\'t know my pop!\"\"Vhat\\'ll he do?\"\"He\\'ll\"--Mary remembered previous punishments for smaller offenses,and recalled the judgment that she had heard her father pronounce ona hypothetical offender.  \"He\\'ll beat me till I\\'m near dead,\" shedeclared; \"an\\' then, like as not, he\\'ll turn me out of the house.\"They were at pause in the shadow of an old buttonwood tree, Maxleaning against the gnarled trunk, the girl facing him, erect.Even as she sketched her possible punishment, the possible becameprobable.  She was afraid, and this young man, who had been sodeferential, so protecting, who had given her so alluring a glimpseof another world, seemed her only refuge.He put out his hands and, gently, took both of hers.At that touch the last of her anger melted, almost to tears.\"Look here,\" he said.  \"I\\'ve been decent to you, haven\\'t I?  I ain\\'ttried to get fresh?\"She shook her head, not trusting speech.\"Vell, then, listen here,\" he pursued.  \"If your old man gets gay,chust remember _that_.  You ain\\'t treated righd at home, the best oftimes.  You said so yourself.  Un\\' this here jay town\\'s no _place_for a pretty young lady like you, anyvays.  So, if there\\'s anytrouble, you come for me, und I\\'ll get you avay from here.\"The girl thrilled with a delicious sense of adventure.  She trembledwith the foretaste of a new delight.  The passing praise of her looksand of her newly acquired maturity, a novel sound in her ears, wasnot lost upon her; but even that was dwarfed by the tenor of hercompanion\\'s words, and the wonderful current that ran from his handsto hers.  Was this what had been meant, that truant afternoon, by thecalling birds, the leafing trees and the poignant air along theriver?  Was this what young women felt when lovers told their love?She could not have formulated the questions, but her heart askedthem, and Max, meanwhile, was repeating:\"I\\'ll get you avay from here!\"\"How--how could you do it?\" she gasped.\"It\\'d be dead easy.  If there\\'s any scrap, you vatch your chanc\\'t un\\'give the house the slip.  I\\'ll be vaitin\\' at the hotel till midnight.Delephone me from the nearest drugstore, un\\' ve\\'ll take a trolleydown the line un\\' catch a train to N\\'York un\\' be married there thissame nighd.  I\\'ve a friend who\\'s a minister un\\' vill get out of hisbed any hour I\\'d ask him.\"He pressed her hands tighter, and, as he leaned against the tree,drew her slightly toward him.But Mary, though she did not know why, still fearful, held back.\"I--we couldn\\'t do that,\" she said.\"Vhy not?\" he demanded.\"Because--why, we couldn\\'t go away together, alone: it wouldn\\'t beright.\"Max straightened suddenly.  He released her hands and placed onetight arm about her waist.\"It vould be righd if I _lofed_ you,\" he said.  \"Und I do lof you.Ve city folk, ve can\\'t do things slow-like you liddle town people.Vhen I saw you this morning, I knew I liked you, because you vas sodifferent from all these rubes around here; un\\' vhen I talk vith youthis efenin\\' I know I lof you.  Listen here: you come avay with meto-_nighd_.  Ve vill go righd ofer to N\\'York, un\\' there ve getmarried righd avay.  No more school, nor dishvashin\\', nor scoldin\\'.Your own fader vill be pleased vhen it\\'s ofer, because my fader isreech, un\\' my fader vill be pleased too, because he\\'s been devilin\\'me to marry for more\\'n a ye-ar, only I nefer till now found a girl I_lof_.  Come on, Mary: I lof you!\"Her eyes swam in a mist.  They had come then--love and freedom, handin hand.  Her soul grew faint within her.  She struggled a little,fluttering like a young bird in a capturing palm, but he drew hertighter, and his free hand passed electrically across her cheek.\"Come on avay!\" he urged softly.\"I--I don\\'t know what to do!\" she panted.  \"Wait--wait \"--it was theancient cry of womanhood upon the brink--\"wait till to-morrow!\"There was a step behind them, which Max was the first to hear.  Hefreed her, and they stood mute until the shadowy passer-by had gone.It was an incident that at least lessened the spell.\"Perhaps it\\'s all right,\" said Mary.  \"Perhaps Etta didn\\'t see me,an\\' I can tell \\'em I was over at my girl-friend\\'s.\"\"It\\'s only puttin\\' off vhat\\'s got to happen _some_time,\" Max argued.\"This town\\'s no place for a girl like you.\"He leaned toward her, but she drew, reluctantly, away.  What might bewell by day may well seem ill by night.\"Wait till to-morrow, anyhow,\" she urged.--But to-morrow, shewondered, how should she explain her afternoon away from school?Max considered.\"All righd,\" he at last nodded.  \"Go home un\\' think things ofer vithyourself; but I\\'ll be chust as ready to-morrow as I am to-day.You\\'ve got to get avay from all this ugliness.  Remember that, un\\'remember I hafn\\'t been _fresh_, un\\' I vant righd now to marry you.  Ihafn\\'t efen tried to kiss you.  Think of that, un\\' think that I\\'ll bevaitin\\' up at the hotel, in case of drouble, till _mid_nighd.\"He wheeled at that, and left her.Ten minutes later--at a quarter to seven, so rapidly had the dramaunrolled itself--she had reached home to find that Etta had beenthere before her.  Denbigh, on the early morning shift that week, wasalready in bed, but her mother tossed the truant into the parlor andlocked both doors while she went up stairs to waken him.He came down at once, in his nightshirt, roaring.  He turned the keyand flung wide the door.The room, however, was empty, and the window open.  Mary and Max werealready together, hurrying through the warm spring evening toward thetrolley-car that was to carry them on the first stage of theirjourney to New York.IIITHE SPECTER OF FEARA sixteen an angry and frightened girl running away from a home wherethe necessity for work must cheat her youth of its just rights--atsixteen such a girl cannot analyze her emotions, and Mary\\'s were insheer panic.  She had never before been farther from her own townthan the ten miles\\' distant county-seat, had never before been atmore than verbal odds with her parents.  Philadelphia had stood forthe City of Lanterns, and a quick retort for revolution.  Now she wasbound for New York and marriage.There was none of the few persons on the trolley-car that knew her,yet she kept her face to the window and away from them.  There was nochance of capture, yet she trembled whenever the brakes creaked and anew passenger came aboard.  It might, perhaps, be truly said that shedid not feel at all, and that the power of poignant realization wasstill paralyzed by her own action.  It was as if she had amputated aportion of her spiritual being, and wras still numb from the shock.Whatever Max\\'s own feelings, he at any rate conducted himself in themanner least calculated to rouse his companion.  He spoke only togive the few necessary directions, and then in a low tone, not facingher, but looking straight ahead.  He had slipped her the money to payher own fare and, the better to deceive whoever might follow them,had told her to buy a round-trip ticket to a point beyond that forwhich they were bound.  With his lemon-colored shoes planted upon hissuitcase, he sat beside her, but he kept as wide a space between themas the short seat would permit; and it was only under the discreetcovering of the light overcoat upon his knee that he kept a tight andreassuring grasp of her firm hand.At a mile from the county-town they left the car--Mary first and Maxtwenty yards behind--and then, for the competent young man seemed tohave prepared for everything, walked across the fields, under thestars, to a flag-station where, within a few minutes, they couldcatch a New York express.  Arm in arm they walked, but Max never oncefrightened her by a burst of affection, never once did more than toencourage her by plain statements of his loyalty and more ornatedescriptions of the life before her.\"You vill _like_ it,\" he concluded.  \"I know you vill be happy, Mary.\"Mary\\'s breath caught a little in her throat.\"Ye--yes,\" she answered.  \"Only, I can\\'t help thinking some aboutmom.\"\"Sure you can\\'t,\" Max immediately agreed.  \"You mustn\\'t led her vorrylonger than you can help it.  I tell you vhat ve\\'ll do.  Ofer here inthe station, you wride her a letter und I\\'ll haf it mailed.\"\"Oh, but then pop would see it, an\\' he might follow us!\"\"Don\\' gif no names or say vhere ve\\'re goin\\', und how can he?  By thetime he gets it, ve\\'ll be safe married, anyways.  Here ve are at thestation.  I\\'ve got some paper un\\' pencil und an envellup: I\\'ll tellyou chust vhat to wride.\"He did tell her, and this note, given to the train-porter, was mailedfarther along the line:\"_Dear Mother_: Don\\'t please worry about me.  I will soon be back fora visit, only I have gone to Buffalo to get married.  He is a niceyoung man and his father is rich, for I could not stand to have Popbeat me, nor do other people\\'s work any more.  \"Your aff. daughter,        \"MARY DENBIGH.\"The train, which Max had duly signaled, had stopped just as thewriting was ended, and the pair of runaways had hurried into the lastseat of the rear car.During the journey that followed, Mary\\'s nerves, accustomed to earlyhours, gave way not to tears, but to the exhaustion consequent uponthe strain of her crowded day.  Her hat in her lap, her russet hairmade a pillow for her against the sharp window-sill, and, with Max\\'scoat piled at the pane to protect her from the keen arrows of theinrushing night air, she lay back, the pink cheeks and the red mouthpaler than an hour since, and the blue eyes closed.  She did not seemto sleep, and yet it was in a dream that the ride ended, in a dreamthat she found herself one of a hurrying crowd stamping down theplatform and into the huge elevator at the Jersey City station, in adream that she clung faithfully to Max\\'s arm as the sudden lights anddamp odors struck her and as she dropped upon a straw-covered benchof a swaying car, which shot them immediately through a tunneleddarkness into the very depths of the earth.She knew from her geography that New York was separated from NewJersey by water.\"When do we cross the ferry, Max?\" she asked.Max smiled, his thin lips showing his white teeth in sharp contrastto his olive skin.\"We\\'re crossing it now,\" he answered.\"But where\\'s the water?\"Max, mopping his dark forehead with a purple-bordered handkerchief,pointed to the roof of the car.\"Up there,\" he said.  \"Ve\\'re in the tube, you know.\"She did not know, but she was too much ashamed of her rural ignorancefurther to discover it by unconsidered questions, and so full of apulsing wonder at what was to come next, so full of the expectationof the child at her first melodrama that she had place for nobackward thought.  She sat silent until they had come out of thetunnel, climbed a windy stair, and emerged upon a thoroughfare asmuch ablaze as if all the stars of heaven had descended to light it,and as brimming with moving life as her father\\'s mill at ten o\\'clockin the morning.Max regarded the girl\\'s open-eyed wonder.\"Now,\" he said, \"ve\\'ll chust chump in a taxi un\\' go get a goodsupper, un\\' then, vhile the vaiter\\'s filling our order, I\\'ll first doa little delephoning.\"He put up his dark hand; a passing automobile, its tin flag raised,hummed up to the curb, and Mary, clinging timidly to the arm of herbetrothed, began her first ride in a taxicab.The street--it was Fourteenth Street, he told her--flared and seethedand spluttered before them.  As if leaning over the head of a runawayhorse, they shot in and out among clanging cable-cars, dashed bysnorting vehicles of their own sort, and nearly grazed jostling cabsdriven by cursing Jehus.  Even at that late hour, some of the shopswere still open, and the wide pavements on either side were blackwith countermarching processions of people, moving with the steadyrapidity and stolidity of a swarm of ants.  When the street ran by atree-sprinkled square, its houses seemed to burst into still greaterbrightness to atone for the darkness of the park.  Every secondbuilding was a restaurant, a theater for moving-pictures, or asaloon.  Their electric-signs now winked from nothingness to light,now flashed forth a word, one letter at a time, and now weresurrounded with wriggling snakes of fire.It came upon her--this vision of the absolutely new, of the city\\'simmensity and teeming life--at a moment when her heart was ready forreaction, when memory was prepared to reassert itself, and when,anger gone and regret poised like a runner at the starting-line, herquick determination might have failed her.  But it came withstupefying force.  The dream of pleasure gave place for the moment toa certainty of dread.  Vaguely, unreasoningly, but with theunquestioning acceptance of a child, she felt New York as a terrible,solidified unity; as a vast, malevolent consciousness; as a livingprison that implacably and resistlessly raised itself on every handand on every hand shut her in forever.She trembled and clung the tighter to her companion\\'s arm, and hercompanion was alert to note her agitation.\"Vhat\\'s the matter?\" he inquired, in a voice that he well meant to betender.\"I--I don\\'t know,\" she began, her red underlip indrawn.  \"I--aren\\'twe goin\\' pretty fast?\"\"Who?  Us?  Vhy, I was chust thinking I\\'d tell him to hit up the pacea little.  Are you scared?\"Her pride would not permit confession.\"Oh, no,\" she lied; \"I\\'m not scared.\"\"But you are shivering.\"\"I guess I\\'m kind of chilly.\"\"All righd.  Chust vait a minute un\\' ve\\'ll soon be at the restaurantun\\' varm up.  You\\'ll like that restaurant: it\\'s von of the swellestin town.\"\"But it\\'s pretty late,\" she ventured.  \"Your friend--are you surehe----\"\"Who?  The minister?\"  Max patted her hand with reassuring affection.\"Don\\'t you vorry about him.  He\\'s all for me, und I\\'ll get him out ofbed chust as soon as ve\\'ve ordered our supper.\"A few blocks more, and Max, aided by a marvelously tall person in awonderful uniform, was helping her, with what she considered anelaborate courtesy, to dismount from the taxi, pass under a glassawning and, through a changing stream of hurrying waiters andarriving and departing guests terribly arrayed, to climb a softlycarpeted stair and enter a brilliant balcony open to the street andfull of chattering men and women eating and drinking at a score oftables.  Even in her fright, it was with a touch of admiration thatshe observed how Max--her Max--seemed to be known to the immediatelyattentive waiters, and how, smiling, they hurried to make way for him.They secured a corner table, a relatively quiet corner table, andthere, with a servant standing by, pencil in hand, and with a hugedouble-paged menu-card before each of them, made ready for their meal.\"Chust you order vhatever you like,\" said Max.  \"Pretty neareverything in the vorld\\'s on there, but if you vant anything that youcan\\'t see, chust you ask for it.\"Mary looked at the card.  In spite of all that had passed, and allthat now filled her heart, she was young, and youth is so fortunateas to be able to eat in the trough of any emotional sea.  She was achild, and, by the sure logic of childhood, who-so thought to feedher could be nothing but a friend.The card, however, was of small assistance.  Its very size wasappalling, and its offerings were made in an unfamiliar tongue.\"You get what you like,\" she at last submitted.  \"I\\'m so hungry I caneat anything.\"He saw her difficulty so well that he could rescue her from itwithout seeming to see it at all.\"Vell, I\\'m vith you there,\" he said cheerfully, and proceeded to obeyher, rattling off a list of dishes of no one of which she had everheard before.  \"Un\\' have the Martinis dry,\" he cautioned inconclusion, \"vith a dash of absinthe in them--un\\' bring them righdavay: I\\'m spittin\\' gotten.\"The waiter left, and, as he did so, Max again addressed the girl.\"Excuse me for von minute,\" he said.But Mary\\'s blue eyes opened wide in instant alarm, and she put adetaining hand upon his wrist.\"Don\\'t!\" she quavered.  \"Don\\'t go away!  I--I don\\'t want to be leftalone.\"Max laughed outright.\"Haf you forgot our minister?\" he demanded.  \"Ve don\\'t vant to go tohis house vithout first giffin\\' him a chanc\\'t to get some _clothes_on.  Efen up your vay, the ministers vear a suit under theirnighd-gowns vhen they marry people.\"She smiled faintly at his labored wit, and, as her heart fluttered atthis definite approach to the end of her journey, permitted him to go.Had he been absent for only the minute that he had promised, the timewould have seemed long to the waiting girl, but he remained invisiblefor much longer, and to Mary, watching the laughing, uncaringstrangers from another life, the terror of the city in her soul andthe sense of all that she had done lurking in the shadows of herbrain, the quarter of an hour appeared to be four times that period.Once she feared that he had met with some accident; once she wassaved from starting in search of him only by the knowledge that, inso doing, she must infallibly lose herself.  She would have madeinquiries of a waiter, but the waiters were too imposing.  She wouldhave cried, but she was afraid to cry.  She would have ended,perhaps, by some utter betrayal of all that was battling within her;but, just when she was sure, for the thousandth time, that she couldendure no more, she saw Max coming toward her from the long-watcheddoor.As soon as she noticed his strangely stern face, the old fear gaveplace to a fresh one.\"What\\'s happened?\" she asked.He pulled back his chair spitefully and flung himself into it.\"These crazy laws of your America,\" he snarled, \"there ain\\'t no sensein them!\"\"What\\'s the matter?\" she repeated.\"Vhy, it\\'s this way.  Of course, it don\\' make no difference; it onlyputs things off till _mor_nin\\'; but it\\'s this vay: I got my ministerfriend on the \\'phone, un\\' he\\'s all ready to marry us, only he saysthe law says ve must haf a license from City Hall first, un\\' if vedon\\'t get von, he can go to chail because of marryin\\' us vith_out_it.\"\"Well,\" said Mary, \"let\\'s get a license.\"Max spread forward the palms of his dark hands.\"How can ve?\" he demanded.  \"The City Hall closes in the afternoonun\\' don\\'t open till _mor_nin\\'.\"Here, apparently, was tragedy.  Specific reasons for its tragicelements the girl would, perhaps, have found it hard to give, butthat it was tragic she knew instinctively.  Her blue eyes opened widein fright.\"What are we to do?\" she pleaded.But Max, the resourceful, had been, it appeared, only temporarilycheckmated.\"I thought of that,\" he said.  \"Ve can\\'t get married now tillto-morrow; but my modder has a good friend un\\' I delephone _her_.She told me she\\'d be glad to have you her guest ofer to-nighd.  I\\'lltake you there in a taxi, un\\' go home for my own sleep.  I\\'d take youvith me, but it vouldn\\'t do to spring a new vife on the familyvithout varnin\\'.  Then I\\'ll have talked vith my own people, und I\\'llbring them around to the veddin\\', first thing in the mornin\\'.\"Mary, however, quailed.\"I don\\'t want to do that,\" she inconsequently responded.  \"I don\\'twant to go to strange people\\'s alone.\"\"Oh, don\\'t you vorry, now,\" Max soothed her.  \"I\\'ll go vith you for aliddle vhile un\\' see that you make yourself at home.  This friend ofmy modder\\'s is a fine voman, un\\' she\\'s _rich_.  She is Mrs. Légère.She lives in a fine house: you\\'ll like her.\"He persisted in his persuasions, and, in the end, he won heracquiescence.  After all, here were the walls of the city about her,and she had no choice.While they had been talking, the waiter had returned and had placedbefore each of them one of the stemmed glasses full of the paleyellow concoction that Max had ordered.\"Vell,\" grinned the host, \"here\\'s happy returns of the day un\\' many_of_ them.\"He took his glass in his hairy hand and flung the contents down histhroat.But Mary looked at the drink in growing alarm.\"Isn\\'t it whiskey?\" she asked.\"No-o-o!  I don\\'t drink vhiskey.  This is only vermout\\' un\\' tchin.\"\"Gin\\'s just the same as whiskey,\" the girl protested.\"Not by a long sighd it ain\\'t.\"\"It\\'s liquor, anyhow.\"\"Sure, it\\'s liquor; but drink a liddle of it; it vill gif you anappetite.\"Mary shook her russet head.\"I don\\'t need no appetite,\" she said; \"I\\'m half starved as it is.\"\"You\\'ll need something to grind up these here Hungarian things,though.\"\"No,\" said Mary; \"I\\'d rather not.\"\"But efferybody does here in New York.\"\"Then I guess I\\'ll wait till I\\'m a regular New Yorker.\"\"Don\\'t your fader drink?\"\"Sometimes he does,\" said the girl, conclusively; \"an\\' that\\'s why Idon\\'t.\"He urged her no further; he even denied himself a glass of the winethat he had ordered, and he succeeded, by this abstinence, inregaining whatever he had lost of her faith in him.  He ate heartilyhimself, and if his manner of eating was not precisely that mostcommon in restaurants of a more careful sort, this was something thatthe girl would have failed to note even had she not been so busilyengaged by wonder at the service and consumption of the novel food.It was not until, contentedly sighing, she had sunk back from thewreck of her second ice, that she remembered again the lateness ofthe hour.With a display of his large bills and another flurry of attendants,they left the restaurant, walking among the gayly dressed and loudlylaughing people at the tables, passing down the heavily carpetedstairs, and entering another pulsing motor-car.  Max leaned out ofthe door and gave an address that Mary did not hear; the chauffeurthrew forward the metal clutch, and the automobile shot ahead on itsjourney.They went for some time under the still hammering elevated; thenturned through a quieter and darker street; threaded rapidly,twisting hither and yon, a dozen other highways and byways and atlength drew up at their destination.  Max leaped lightly to thepavement and tossed the driver a bill.\"Neffer mind the change,\" he said, and had scarcely helped Mary todismount before the car had snorted away into the night, leaving thepair of young lovers in the scarcely broken darkness and in a silencethat seemed surrounded by a dim, distant rumble of city-sound.The girl could see little of her whereabouts.  She observed only thatshe was in a slumbering block of blinded dwelling-houses, a scenedifferent from any that New York had thus far presented to her.  Onedistant, sputtering arc-light succeeded only in accentuating thegloom; underfoot the way resounded to the slightest tread; from thelittle patch of inky sky into which the roofs blended above, a barehandful of anæmic stars twinkled drowsily, and, on both sides, fromcorner to corner, the uniform, narrow houses rose in somberrepetition, each with its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each withits blank windows, each seemingly asleep behind its mask.More than this, indeed, Mary\\'s tired eyes could have had no time toobserve, for Max\\'s strong fingers were at once curled under herarmpit, and she was hurried up to one of the innumerable mutedoorways.  He pressed a button hidden somewhere in the wall, and,almost immediately, the door swung open.The pair looked from darkness upon a rosy twilight.  Under the feeblerays of the pink-shadowed stairway, there were just visible theoutlines of a full-blown form.\"Hello, Rosie!\" cried Max as, quickly snapping the door behind him,he passed by his charge and seized an invisible hand.  \"You vaited upfor us un\\' come to the door yourself!  That vas good of you.\"In spite of her Gallic cognomen, Mrs. Rose Légère replied in the toneand vernacular of Manhattan Island.\"Sure I waited for you,\" she answered.  \"But don\\'t talk so loud:you\\'ll wake the whole family.--And is this the little lady, eh?\"Half disposed to resist, Mary felt herself gently propelled forwardby Max, and then enveloped in an ample, strangely perfumed embrace,while two full warm lips printed a kiss upon her cool young cheek.\"Come into the back parlor,\" said Rose Légère, lightly seizing thegirl\\'s hand.  \"I want to get a look at the bride.\"She led the way past the closed double doors of the front room on theground floor, and into a rear apartment that, though not brilliantlyilluminated, was far better lighted than the hall.It was a room the like of which Mary had never seen, decorated incolors that outshone the rainbow and filled to overflowing withfurniture that, to the undiscriminating eyes of the girl, gave it theair of a chamber in the Cave of Monte Cristo.  Gilt-framed picturesof beautiful men and women--she supposed they must be Grecian men andwomen--flamed, in more than lifelike hues, from the crimson walls.The tall lamp on the blue-clothed table was shaded in red; the thickrug flowered gorgeously; the deep chairs were upholstered in palebrown, and the lazy sofa on which, as Max closed the inner door upontheir entrance, Mrs. Légère seated herself with her guest, wasstuffed with soft pillows of bewildering radiance.Nor, when Mary came to look at her, did the hostess seem out ofkeeping with her surroundings.  To the girl\\'s home Owen Denbigh hadonce brought a large, lithographed calendar, issued by a brewery, anddepicting, at its top, a woman of the elder Teutonic days, very redand white, with long yellow hair, and a body of rounded proportions,which threatened to grind to powder the rock on which she sat, anddesperately endangered the filmy garments that enfolded withoutclothing her.  It was of this picture that Mary instantly thoughtwhen she got her first full view of Mrs. Légère.The hostess was clad in a long, fluttering, baby-blue kimona, spottedby embroidered white dragons, with sleeves that fell despairinglyfrom her puckered elbows, disclosing thick white arms with rolls offat at the wrists, and plump hands and fingers the almond shapednails of which gleamed like the points of daggers.  The folds oflight silk, held by a large amethyst pin at the base of her sturdythroat, bulged broadly over her capacious breasts and trailed, acrossfrou-frouing lace, far beyond her heels.All this Mary saw first, and then, looking upward across the figurethat, literally, overshadowed her, she saw a large, round,good-enough-natured face, surmounting a white double chin.  Thecorn-colored hair was massed in an intricate maze of puffs and coilsand braids, which made the girl wonder how much was its owner\\'snatural growth and how much was due to the artifices that Mary hadalways longed for and had always been denied.  The forehead was lowand calm; the violet eyes of a more than natural brightness, withcrowsfeet beside them and pouches below, only just discernible inlamplight.  The brows and lashes were of a blackness that contrastedwith the coiffure; the skin, here like snow and there as red asroses, and the full, easy-going mouth as crimson as a wound.  Marythought that here at last was a beautiful woman.\"I sure am glad to see you,\" purred Mrs. Légère, as, having divestedthe guest of hat and coat, she whisked these into the hall and,returning, again seated herself and fondled the visitor\\'s passive,but flattered, hand between her own extensive, well-cared-for palms.\"Max raved about you over the telephone--just raved--and, now that Iget to a clinch with you, I begin to think that he knew what he wastalking about.\"Max was seating himself on an orange-colored ottoman opposite them.He grinned broadly, his narrowed lips showing his even, sparklingteeth.\"Sure I knew vhat I vas talkin\\' about,\" he declared.Mary was not used to compliments, but she was too honest not to showthat she liked them.  She blushed, and was all the prettier for it;but she did manage to deprecate the sentiments of the better known ofher critics.\"Mr. Grossman is crazy,\" she modestly observed.\"About you he is,\" said Mrs. Légère; \"and,\" she added, \"I doo\\'t blamehim.--But look here\"--she placed a crooked forefinger under thegirl\\'s chin and turned the blushing face upward--\"look here, what atired little woman it is!--Max, you\\'re so careless, I\\'ll bet you\\'venever thought to give this poor child a drop of wine to strengthenher after all that traveling!\"\"I tried to get her to,\" said Max, \"but she vouldn\\'t take it.\"\"What?\"\"I don\\'t drink,\" explained Mary.\"Of course you don\\'t, but,\" Mrs. Légère elucidated, \"taking a glassor two of wine after a railroad ride isn\\'t drinking.\"\"No-o,\" Mary granted; \"but I don\\'t care for it.\"\"I hope not--only taken this way it\\'s medicine.  I don\\'t blame youfor not drinking in a restaurant with a bad boy like Max; but youneed it now; you\\'re all played out.  This is as good as your hometill to-morrow, you know.  Just have a little with me; I\\'m old enoughto be your mother, and we won\\'t give Max a drop--just to punishhim.--Cassie!\"She had run through the speech with a rapidity that had left the girlno chance for reply, and now, before Mary could move her lips, shehad, with amazing agility, leaped to a back door, opened it, calledan order into the darkness beyond, and as quickly returned to herformer position on the sofa.\"It will be the best thing in the world for you,\" she said.  \"Thedoctor orders it for me, and so I always have it ready on ice.\"As she concluded speaking, the door through which she had called wasreopened and there entered a tall, raw-boned, glum, colored girl,whose shining ebony skin was darkened by the white apron that shewore.  She bore a tray on which was a gilt-topped bottle and twonarrow glasses.\"Put it there, Cassie,\" said Mrs. Légère, pointing to the table.The girl obeyed and left the room.  Max seized the bottle, ripped offthe gilding and, wrapping his purple-bordered handkerchief about theneck, with one dexterous twist, drew out the resounding cork.A living foam gushed from the neck as the self-appointed butlerpoured into the two glasses a pale gold fluid, which creamed angrilyto their edges, and then subsided until first one addition and thenanother set them boiling again.Mrs. Légère took a glass in each hand and pressed the foremost intothe passive palm of the girl.\"Well,\" said she, in a phrase new to Mary, \"here we are.\"Mary hesitated, the glass to her lips.  She could hear the liquidwhispering to her, and particles seemed to jump from it and sting hereyes.\"What is it?\" she asked.\"Vine,\" said Max.\"But what kind of wine?\" she weakly delayed.\"My dear,\" her entertainer informed her, \"there is only one kind ofwine in New York.\"\"It\\'s tchampagne,\" hissed Max, as if the name were something toosacred to be spoken in the tone of ordinary conversation.  \"Un\\' thiskind costs eighd dollars a bottle.\"The words and the connotation had their lure.  Champagne--she hadheard of it as the beverage of the rich; and eight dollars for onebottle--the price of two winter dresses!\"Come on,\" smiled Mrs. Légère.The girl still hesitated.\"Here\\'s to the wedding!\" prompted the hostess, and drank the entirecontents of her glass.Mary took a mouthful and swallowed it.  At first she nearly choked.Then the fiery liquid brought fresh tears to her blue eyes, stillsmarting from the gas that had, a moment before, assailed them.  Butfinally, there began to spread through her weary body a gratefulglow, and, half in apology for what she feared had been a clownishexhibition, she looked up with red lips pleasantly parted.\"Now, wasn\\'t I right?\" inquired Mrs. Légère.  \"Don\\'t you feel betteralready?\"\"I--I believe I do, thank you,\" Mary admitted.  \"Anyhow, it is prettygood, I guess--when you get used to it.\"She took, bravely and with an ease now gained by experience, a seconddrink, and, as she held the glass before her, Max gallantlyreplenished it.A bell rang and the glum, ebony maid passed through the room, closingboth doors behind her.Mary, alarmed at this nocturnal interruption, started a little, butneither of her companions seemed to regard the incident as unusual.\"You look much better,\" Mrs. Légère asseverated.  \"Finish that glass,dearie, and you\\'ll be all to the good again.\"\"Do you think I\\'d better take so much?\"Both Max and Mrs. Légère laughed unaffectedly.\"Vhy, there ain\\'t enough here to hurt a baby,\" declared the former.Mary accepted the assurance.  She did not like the taste of thechampagne, but she knew now that she had been very tired, and thewine sent fresh life and energy through her sleepy limbs.  Sheemptied the glass and felt, joyfully, all her fears and regretsslipping for her.  Doubt and difficulty were resolved into ashimmering mist, were overcome, were forgotten.The black maid thrust her head in at the hall-doorway.Mrs. Légère rose.\"Excuse me,\" she said, leaving the room.  \"I\\'ll be right back.\"Max, the instant she was gone, rose in his turn.\"I\\'m going to fool her,\" he said.  \"I\\'m going to graft her drink!\"He took the glass that his hostess had placed upon the table, pouredmore of the wine into it, replenished the glass of his nowunresisting companion and sat down by her side, his arm stretchedbehind her.Mary, with refreshed courage, broke the silence.  She was feelinglike a naughty child triumphantly successful in her naughtiness.\"Do you know, Max,\" she said, \"I gave a jump when that bell rang?  Ithought for a minute they might be after us.\"\"Nix on that,\" chuckled Max.  \"They couldn\\'t catch us if they tried.Here\\'s to the runavays!\"They clinked glasses and drank.\"I guess,\" the young man pursued, \"it was chust von of Rosie\\'sboarders.\"\"Her boarders?  Does she run a boarding-house?\"  There was a note ofdignified scorn in Mary\\'s climbing voice.\"Sure she keeps boarders.\"\"But I----\"  Mary hesitated.  She was tasting wine for the first timein her life, she had been tired and nerve-wracked, and now, thoughthoughts danced through her mind with unfamiliar rapidity, utteranceseemed to her suddenly, and somewhat amusingly, to have become tooclumsy to keep pace with them.  \"I thought,\" she elaboratelypersisted, \"that--you--said--she--was rich.\"\"She is,\" said Max; \"only she\\'s got a big house she can\\'t all useherself.  Lots of people fill their houses that vay in N\\'York.\"Mary started to formulate a reply that came glistening along the dimhorizon of her mind; but just then there was a light tap at the door.\"Come in!\" called Max, and Mrs. Légère re-entered.The precaution of her hostess forced a smile from Mary.\"Why did you knock?\" she asked.But Mrs. Légère shook her corn-colored locks wisely.\"I don\\'t ever disturb lovers,\" she said.She sat down opposite the pair she was addressing and, withoutnoticing that Max had appropriated her glass, discovered a fresh oneon the mantelpiece, poured herself a mouthful of the wine and thendecanted the rest for Mary.She had just put down the empty bottle when the bell rang a secondtime.\"Good Lord,\" she sighed, \"there it goes again!  These people will bethe death of me, losing their keys and coming in at all hours.  Nevermind, Cassie,\" she called through the rear door, \"I\\'ll go myself!\"And then, to Mary, she concluded: \"I\\'ll attend to this and then I\\'llcome right back and send Max home and show you to your room.\"She left them seated on the sofa, Max\\'s dark hand encircling thesoft, young fingers of the girl as gently as if he had been a rusticwooer.\"Shall I go graft another bottle from the _kit_chen?\" he asked,grinning impishly.Mary shook her russet head.\"Not for me,\" she said; \"I guess I\\'ve had enough.\"Max again refrained from insistence.  Instead, he remained besideher, and fell once more into the story that she had learned best tolike,--the beautiful pictures of the wonderful city, of the work-freelife that she should lead there, and of their marriage on the fastapproaching morning.Gradually, as his voice ran smoothly on, the words he was then sayingbecame confused in her brain with other words that he had saidearlier in the evening.  Her eyelids grew heavy.  The mood ofexhilaration passed, and a weariness far more compelling than thatfrom which she had previously suffered stole upon her.  Mrs. Légèrewas absent for an unconscionable time.  The girl yawned.\"I wonder when she\\'s comin\\' back,\" said Mary, \"I\\'m--I\\'m awful tired.\"Max\\'s hand slipped to her unresisting head and pressed it down uponhis shoulder.  He had not yet so much as kissed her, and he did notkiss her now.\"Don\\'t vorry about her,\" he said softly.  \"You\\'re tired out.  Chustclose your eyes for a minute, Mary, un\\' I\\'ll vake you vhen she comes.\"His shoulder was very comfortable.  She closed her blue eyes.\"You will wake me?\" she murmured.\"Sure I vill,\" said Max.  \"I\\'ll have you clean avake before she\\'sthrough knockin\\'.\"But he must have forgotten that promise, for when Mrs. Légère at lastreturned, he was still sitting there among the pillows, Mary\\'s hairfallen over his green coat, her cheeks pinker than ever, and hergirlish breast rising and falling rhythmically in sleep.IVAWAKENINGClinging to a gigantic pendulum, Mary was swept through a mightycurve of roaring darkness, up from the black chasm of insensibility,and tossed, swaying over that frightful cliff, to the precipitouscrag of consciousness.  For what seemed many minutes, she tottered onthe verge, dizzy, afraid.  Then white knives, swift and sharp,slashed at her eyes and forced up the lids.Defying closed blinds and drawn chintz curtains, the sunlight ofnoonday beat upon her face.  She pulled something between her cheekand the leaping rays.  Her hand trembled.At first she could neither think nor recollect.  The blows of an ax,regular, tremendous, were splitting her head.  Her throat was hot anddry and choking.  Her stomach crawled and leaped with nausea.  Fromhead to foot she was shaking with recurrent nervous chills thatwracked a body of which every muscle was strained and sore.Realization of the present came slowly, but it preceded all memory ofthe past.  She found that the thing with which she had instinctivelyshaded her eyes was a sheet, and, as she lowered it, she saw, in aglance where the employment of sight was a separate pain, that shewas lying among large pillows in a big brass bed, heavily mattressed.Beyond the foot of the bed her survey could not extend, because thefoot was high and hung with a pink and green down quilt; but betweentwo windows against the wall to her right, she saw a bureau, bearinga few scant toilet articles, and opposite, on the left, there was awashstand with a basin on the floor before it and, on its top, apitcher, a soap-tray, a small brown bottle, and a little blue boxbursting with white cotton.This was not the room in which she had first fallen asleep.With that isolated fact flashing like a message of disaster throughher brain, she sat suddenly upright in the bed; but the room pitchedbefore her like a boat in the trough of a storm on the river at home.A wave of sickness hissed over her, and she sank back among pillowsrepellantly scented.Vaguely she realized that she must be in a room somewhere above theground floor.  Dimly she began to wonder how she had got up thestairs.  What would the kindly Mrs. Légère think of her condition?And that which had happened--had it lasted for an hour or a night?That which had happened--there memory, in a blinding blast,reasserted itself.  What had been but half-wittingly accepted was nowwholly known.  Hot irons were branding upon her brain the fullhistory of all that had occurred: the deeds for which she had at lastlearned the name, and the deeds that, even in her own frightenedsoul, were nameless.  There was nothing--nothing of her, hand andfoot, and mouth and eye and soul--that was not defiled.For herself, for Max, but most of all for the hideous facts of life,she shook in physical disgust.  Before the face of such things, whatmust birth and marriage mean?  She opened her eyes, but she could notlook at her silent witnesses; she shut her lids, but she saw, behindthem, the hairy arms of a gorilla closing on her, to break her andbear her away.  For one moment, all that she had loved she hated, andfor the next, seizing his smiling reassurance as the one vow thatcould legalize what nothing could refine, all that she had come tohate she tried to force herself to love.She understood now so much that she had never understood before: thewhispered words of town gossip, the stray glimpses of lovers in thesummer lanes, the cautions and the commands that had once so galledher in her home.At the word, her mind swung back to far-away yesterday.  She wassorry that she had been the cause--for she had been the cause--of thespilling of the stew.  She was sorry that she had been so sharp withSallie.  She wished that she had washed the dishes less unwillingly.She still feared--she more than ever feared--the swaying bulk ofmasculinity that had been her father, but she began to see in him thelogical result of forces that were themselves, as yet, beyond herken; and she looked with a new and pitying vision upon the picture ofher little, work-worn and care-marked mother stooping over thepolished kitchen-stove.Her breast tossed and her throat throbbed; but she was beyond tears.Painfully, slowly, yet with resolution, she struggled back to hersitting-posture in the bed.In this position she found herself facing a long mirror hung againstthe opposite wall, and in the mirror she saw what was herself.  Witha low cry, she pulled loose the sheet and covered her nakedness.That done, she looked again at the strange face that fronted her: aface the more strange because it was the intimate become alien, aruin, an accusation.  Framed in a tangle of dank hair, the cheeks,once pink, were chalky now, and splotched with red, the mouth thatshe had known only as full and firm, was loose and twisted; the eyesthat had been blue, now circled with black, burned in blood-shotfields like coals of angry fire.One impulse alone directed her: to find her clothes; to put them on;to return, as far as the mask of appearances would take her, to theself that she had been.  In spite of aching head and quivering hands,she wrapped the sheet about her and, with infinite care, got from thebed.  The floor seemed to sweep up to meet her, but she steadiedherself against the wall and, each timid stride a separate agony,began to stumble about the room.She looked for a clothes-closet or wardrobe, but there was neither.The only door was the door of exit, and the nearest chair was empty.In a corner she saw a pile of linen: laboriously she stooped andpicked it up, unrolled a portion, and then, gasping in horror, tossedit away.  On the other chair there lay a long kimona of crimson.  Shelifted it and found, neatly arranged below, a sheer cambric garmentedged with coarse lace, two black silk stockings slashed with red,and a pair of slippers, high-heeled, with buckles of brass--for noreason that she could have formulated, the sight sickened her.  Shewent to the bureau and tugged at its drawers, but all that she foundwas a single brown bottle, like that she had first observed on thewashstand, filled with white tablets and labeled \"Poison.\"Obviously, her clothes had been taken from the room.In a panic of shame, she groped blindly for the door: she must callfor Mrs. Légère.  She grasped the knob and turned it--the door waslocked.Fear, mad and unreasoning, drove its spurs into her sides.Forgetting her nausea, heedless of her pain, she ran first to onewindow and then to the other, but the bowed shutters, though theyadmitted the light, would open for nothing beside: they were fastenedwith riveted loops of brass, and, looking through the small spacebetween them, she could catch only a glimpse of the street far below.She tried to argue that the key might have fallen from the lockwithin the room, but she could not find it, and, the sheet droppingfrom her shoulders, she began to rattle at the knob, and then topound upon the panels, her voice rising swiftly from a low call to ahigh, hysterical, frantic cry for help.\"Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!\" she cried, and then assuddenly ceased, tilted against the door, and collapsed into a nakedheap upon the floor.All power of movement seemed to have slipped from her, but when therecame a heavy footfall on the stair, a swish of skirts outside and theloud rasping of a key inserted in the lock, Mary leaped galvanicallyto her feet, gathered the sheet about her body, and flung herselfupon the bed.The door opened and closed behind Rose Légère, who promptly relockedit and slipped the key into the swelling bosom but half concealed byher dragon-spotted, baby-blue negligé.\"What in hell\\'s the matter with _you_?\" she demanded.A little more rotund of figure, a little looser in the cheeks, andmore patently crayoned and powdered about the eyes, a little moreobviously painted and a little older, she was still the woman of thebrewery\\'s advertisement.  But her forehead was knotted in deep, angrywrinkles; her under jaw was thrust so far forward that the roll offat beneath it was invisible, and her eyes snapped with malice.Mary shrank back among the pillows.\"Weren\\'t you yellin\\'?\" persisted Rose.  \"Did you lose your voicedoin\\' it?  What in the hell\\'s the matter with you, I say?\"With a sweep of her stout arm, she seized the girl\\'s bare shoulderand shook it till Mary\\'s teeth clicked like castanets.\"I\\'m not goin\\' to have any such racket in my house!\" the womanasseverated, as she plied her punishment.  \"You\\'ve got to learnfirst-off to keep your mouth to yourself, and be dead sure if youdon\\'t I\\'ll give you a real beatin\\'.\"She tossed Mary from her, as if her victim had been a bundle ofstraw, and stood up again, arms akimbo, breathing scarcely beyond hernormal speed.Mary was half mad and wholly sick with dread.  She wanted to cry outfor rescue and dared not.  She wanted to rise and try to force thedoor or break open the shutters, but she could not move.  She couldonly lie there panting for breath, with her mouth gasping and herheart hammering at her breast.  She had closed her eyes.  She openedthem just in time to see Rose, whose slippered foot had touchedsomething on the floor, stoop, pick up, and place beside the key inher bosom, a crumpled purple-bordered handkerchief.\"Now then,\" said the woman in a tone that, if still hard, was atleast less intense than its predecessor, \"try to tell me what\\'s thetrouble, like somebody this side of Matteawan.\"With a supreme lunge at courage, Mary got her voice.\"I want my clothes,\" she said dully.  \"And where\\'s Max?\"\"Your clothes ain\\'t fit to wear,\" said Rose; \"an\\' I don\\'t know whereMax is.  What you need is breakfast.\"\"I want my clothes,\" monotonously repeated Mary.  \"I couldn\\'t eat tosave my life.  Hasn\\'t Max come back?\"But Rose did not seem to hear the question.\"Nonsense, honey,\" she said, her anger seeming now entirely passed.\"Of course you must eat.  I got up on purpose for it, and I\\'ve setthat nigger cooking a perfect peach of a breakfast.\"\"I want my clothes.\"Rose leaned over the bed and put a soothing hand upon herquestioner\\'s fevered forehead.\"Now don\\'t lose your nerve, dearie,\" she advised.  \"I\\'m yourfriend--honest, I am.  You rest awhile and eat a little, and thenmaybe we\\'ll talk things over.\"\"He hasn\\'t come yet?\"\"No, he hasn\\'t.  But why are you lettin\\' that jar you?  Perhaps he\\'ssick, too.  Perhaps he\\'s had some kind of a scrap with his old man.How do I know what\\'s hit him?  He\\'ll show up all right in the endand, till he does show up, you just make yourself at home here anddon\\'t bother.  I\\'ll take care of you.\"Something in the woman\\'s solicitude--or it may have been the quickand unexplained change from violence to tenderness--frightened Maryeven more than the initial outburst had frightened her.\"I want to go home,\" she quavered.\"Sure you want to go home,\" Rose acquiesced, without moving a muscle.\"But how can you go?  Max told me you\\'d sent your people a notesaying you\\'d hiked out with him to be married, and how can you gohome until he gets back here and you can take him along and show thegoods?\"Her tone was lightly argumentative, but it was also stolidlymerciless, and it hurled true to its mark the shaft of conviction.Out of the yesterday, Mary heard the voice of her father that was thevoice of a society rigidly shaped by the conditions of its ownfashioning:\"Bay \\'un thirty year old an\\' noot another sin ag\\'in \\'un, I would beat\\'un within a bare inch o\\' \\'er deeth, an\\' turn \\'un oot to live thelife \\'un had picked fur herself!\"She understood that statement now.\"I can go to Max\\'s,\" she hazarded.\"To--_where_?\"\"To Max\\'s father\\'s.\"\"Maybe you can; but it\\'s a long trip to Hungary.\"Mary answered nothing.  Rose had only confirmed what the girl had foran hour feared.\"You see how it is,\" pursued Rose, reading Mary\\'s silence with apracticed mind.  \"Better let me take care of you.\"Mary\\'s face was hidden.  Again she felt New York as a malevolentconsciousness, a living prison implacably raising around her itsinsurmountable walls.  There was, she thought, nothing left her butthe diminishing hope of Max\\'s return.\"Now you will eat, won\\'t you?\" Rose was continuing.Mary shook her head.Rose patted quietly one of the clenched hands that lay close to her.\"Better do it, dearie,\" she said.  \"I\\'m your friend; remember that.You can have whatever you want.\"Mary mastered what strength remained to her.  She raised herself onher elbow.\"Then let me go!\" she pleaded, extending an open palm like a beggarasking for a crust.  \"I don\\'t care if my clothes is mussed.  I don\\'tcare what\\'ll happen afterward.  Just let me go!\"\"You\\'re a fool,\" Rose made cool rejoinder.  \"Where\\'d you go?\"\"I don\\'t know?\"\"What\\'d become of you?\"\"I don\\'t care.\"\"Well, you would care, all right, all right.  You can\\'t go home, andyou\\'ve no clothes and no money and no references.  You couldn\\'t getwork anywhere in New York, and you couldn\\'t get away from New York.\"\"I----\"  Mary groped through the darkness of her soul.  \"I can dohousework.\"\"Not without a reference you can\\'t.\"\"I could go to some office----\"\"If you went to any charity-joint, they\\'d throw you out because ofwhat\\'s happened to you.\"\"I could beg on the street if I had to.\"\"Do you think the men in this town give money for nothing to agood-looking girl?  You could go on the street, that\\'s what you coulddo.\"The phrase was new to its hearer, but the tone explained it.\"Then,\" she stumbled forward, \"I could go to the police.  They\\'d helpme.  I could----\"But at that word Rose flew into a torrent of anger and abuse thatdwarfed the former tempest.\"You could, could you?\" she cried.  \"That\\'s your game, is it, yousneaking little innocent?  I\\'ll bet you\\'re a damn sight wiser thanyou let on.  But you don\\'t know this town: you can take that muchfrom me.  Go to the police!  Go to \\'em!  The cops on this beat are myfriends: if you don\\'t believe it, I\\'ll bring \\'em in and introduceyou.  They\\'re my friends, and so\\'s the whole precinct my friends.  Goto \\'em!  Go to \\'em, and I\\'ll have you pinched and locked up for bein\\'what you are!\"Mary had drawn away from the blast, but Rose\\'s powerful fist caughther under the chin and sent her crashing down on the bed.\"You don\\'t come that on me!\" the jailer continued.  \"You\\'ve got yourchoice: you can stay here and live easy, or walk out and go to jail,and that\\'s all you can do.  Max ain\\'t comin\\' back, and you alwaysknew he wouldn\\'t come back.  You know what this house is as well as Ido, and you\\'ve got to stay here and earn your keep.  If you give oneyip I\\'ll have the cops in!  You don\\'t want to eat, hey?  Well then,you shan\\'t eat!  You can lay there and starve, or you can knock onthe door and get the best breakfast you ever had, all ready for you.Do what you please; but if you let out one yip I\\'ll hammer the lifeout of you!\"She turned and left the room.  She banged the door behind her, andMary, in a swirling dream, heard herself again locked in her cell.VTHE BIRDS OF PREYThrough all the days that immediately followed--the days that werenights, and the nights that were red noondays--a thousand horrors,from subtle word to recurring experience, conjoined to assure to Marythe reality of her servitude.  All of that first day, after Rose hadleft her with the dark blood oozing from her cut chin upon thescented pillows, she lay, like a wounded dog, now in a faint and thenin a stupor, on the disordered bed.  As the sunlight shifted and theshadows lengthened in the room, torpor gave way to reawakened fear,and she crawled into a corner and tried to hide herself, trembling,with chattering teeth, at every sound of laughter that rose from thelower floors, at every footstep upon the stair.Thrice Rose returned.  Each time she bore a steaming dish that, asthe girl\\'s physical pain grew less, assailed the nostrils withincreasing poignancy.  Each time Mary shook her stubborn russet head.And each time the visit ended in a beating.Escape by door or window was out of the question; to attempt to raisean alarm was to invite fresh violence; and gradually grew thecertainty that the situation was genuinely as the jailer haddescribed it: that the street was worse than the house, and that Marywas her own prisoner.  She found the bottle labeled \"Poison,\" and bitone of the tablets, but she was young and afraid, and she spat theburning crumbs from her mouth.  She did not dare to die, and whenRose came again to the room, her captive was too weak to refuse thebroth that was fed her, as if she were a sick child, from a spoon.\"You\\'re a dear girl, after all,\" said the mistress, as sheadministered the grateful food.  \"You do as I say and you won\\'t neverbe sorry.  All I want is to have you sensible.  I\\'m your friend.\"Mary said nothing: she was too weak to answer.\"And now,\" Rose pursued, \"I\\'ll just give you a drink.\"And when she had come back, she had not come back alone.The worst of prisons is that in which the door is so cunningly closedupon the inmate that, at last, after the brutality is familiar, theinmate seems originally to have closed it upon herself, and in such afortress of pain Mary now found herself restrained.  The process wassimple.  It was merely first to wound and then to inure.  The descentto hell is not easy; it is red with blood and wet with tears; buthell itself must be endured.It was not for some days that any woman save Rose came to Mary\\'s celland then, one afternoon, two women followed the grating key.They were alike only as to clothes.  Both wore loose negligégarments, but whereas the one was sturdy and German-blonde, withstraw-colored hair, round and heavy face, blue eyes and peasantframe--a younger Rose--the other was wiry, compact, her brows low anddark under somber hair, her full cheeks red only in defiance of aswarthy skin, her eyes black and her mouth vermillion.  It was thisone who, with an accent that a more sophisticated ear than Mary\\'swould have placed along the Seine, was the first to speak.\"\\'Ello!\" she laughed, her teeth gleaming between her lips likepomegranate seeds.  \"We have come to make the call.\"Without awaiting a reply, she jumped upon the bed, drew her feetbeneath her, and produced and lit a cigarette.  The German girl movedmore slowly to the other side and there elaborately ensconced herself.Mary looked at her visitors without immediately replying.  She hadnot, in fact, the remotest idea of what was the fitting word.But the French girl was unruffled by this silence.  She flung herhead back upon a white neck and sent a slow column of blue smokecurling toward the ceiling.\"My name,\" she explained, with an odd clipping of her speech, \"eetees Celeste, an\\' my good frien\\' here,\" she continued with an easygesture of the cigarette, \"she ees Fritzie--chust a bar-bar-ousGerman.\"Mary looked at her with a gaze large and listless.\"An\\' you\\' name?\" pursued Celeste, \"eet ees--what?\"Fritzie supplied the answer, speaking in a ponderous contralto.\"Her name is Mary,\" said she.\"_Bien_--a pretty name,\" Celeste rattled on, precisely as if herunwilling entertainer had made the response.  \"I like eet well;but\"--and she studied with unobtrusive care the russet-framed,indignant face before her--\"eet ees not so good as ees yourself.  It\\'ink--let me see--yaas: I t\\'ink I shall call you \\'Violet.\\'--Violet,why you don\\'t eat more een dees \\'ouse?\"\"I\\'m hardly ever hungry,\" said Mary.\"Not hongry?--Oh-h, but you mohst be hongry!  Anyone so young mohstwant to eat, and anyone so beautiful mohst eat so as not to loose thebeauty.--Ees eet not so, Fritzie?\"The German girl smiled gently and nodded her blonde head.\"Ach, yes,\" she rumbled.  \"The liebchen!\"\"No,\" insisted Mary.  \"I don\\'t care about nothing.  I have a headacheall the time.  I have one now.\"Celeste jumped lightly to the floor: it was as if to uncoil her feetand to reach the door required but a single movement.\"_Un moment!_\" she laughed.  \"I shall feex the _mal de tête_immediate!\"There was no time for remonstrance; the door closed upon herconcluding word, and Mary was left there gazing into the stolid,sphinxlike face of the placidly smiling German.  It was not a badface, and soon Mary realized that it was a contented one.Fritzie was returning her look with an equal curiosity.\"Are you vorried?\" she finally inquired.\"No,\" lied Mary proudly.\"I dought you looked like vorried,\" the German continued.  \"Bud youshould be nod.  Dis iss a goot place.  Dere are loads vorse blaces inNew York dan dis: I know \\'em.\"She paused, but Mary\\'s lips remained closed, her eyes fixed.\"You bed I know \\'um!\" Fritzie repeated.  \"Bud dis blace--vhy, ve hafde best meals, so goot nobody gould besser haf!  I like dis blace.\"A faint question shot into Mary\\'s face.  At once Fritzie answered it.\"Dat\\'s righd.  Listen: I gome over here two year ago in de steerage.Some of de vomen, men meet dem--oh, most all de nod-family vons--un\\'took dem to dese here intelligence office dat are only fakes, un\\'sold dem, vidout dere knowin\\' nussin\\' of it, fur ten un\\' fifteendollar\\' each.  Bud I vas careful.  I get a real tshob.--Ach, himmel!\"She waved a broad palm in disgust.\"Id vas bad enough in de steerage mit all de sailor-mens kissin\\' youto-day un\\' kickin\\' you to-morrow; bud dat tshob of mine, dat vas dereal limit!  I gome over here because I vouldn\\'t vork in de fieldsback home, bud in dat boarding-house vhere I get dat tshob, I get upat dree o\\'clock every mornin\\', because some of de mens vork inJefferson Market, un\\' I haf to scrub, un\\' make de beds, un\\' helpcook, un\\' vait on dable, un\\' vash dishes, un\\' sweep de whole houseoud.  Un\\' den till late at nighd I haf to help cook, un\\' vait ondable, un\\' vash dishes some more still.  Vhenever I am sick, or late,or break von dish, or a boarder don\\' pay, I gets docked.

I stay a mont\\'till she move to Philadelphia.  Den I vent to anozzer house, not sogoot as dat first, fur two mont\\'s till the voman die.  Un\\' den, aftersome more, I gome here, pretty soon, to Miss Rose\\'s.  No\"--she wavedher thick hand toward the door through which Celeste had latelypassed--\"I\\'m nod like dat Frenchie.  She\\'s vhat Phil Beekman calls a\\'gongenital,\\' vatever dat iss; I vork hard enough now, und I vantedto vork righd den; bud I tell you I could not stand it, dough I vasso strong.  No, I\\'m glad I gome here.\"She leaned back upon her elbow.\"Now, dis Celeste----\" she began, but the French girl, just thenentering, came with an air that was a sufficient explanation of hernever complex temperament.\"_Voilà!_\" she smiled, holding aloft a long glass filled by a dullgreen liquid.  \"Let the leetle girl tak some of thees wheech I meexfor her.\"Before she had well realized what she was doing, Mary had acceptedthe glass.\"What is it?\" she asked weakly.\"Absinthe,\" replied Celeste.\"It smells like licorice,\" said Mary.\"Ah, but no; eet ees not that.  You try thees, an\\' then you can eat.\"\"But I don\\'t think I want to eat.\"\"Poof!  That ees folly!  See, now, I meex thees myself--I myself have_frappé_ eet.  Ees eet what you call polite that you say \\'no\\' to me?Say, now: ees eet?\"Involuntarily Mary smiled.  It was a rueful little smile, but it wasa smile of exhausted consent.\"It won\\'t hurt me?\"\"Thees?  You do not know eet.  Eet ees the enemy of all the headache,of all the heartache, of all the bad nerve.\"For answer Mary drained the glass, and when her visitors left herthey turned no key upon their exit.So, slowly, through all those early days, and through the days thatimmediately followed them, the spell of the situation worked.  Therewas infamy, there was torture.  The unending procession ofvisitors--clerks, drummers, car-conductors, teamsters, gamesters,thieves, brothers in the fraternity of lust, equals in the night ofhorror, mostly drunken, nearly all unclean of body and everyonefilthy of mind--the green government note was their certificate ofqualification, the money, however acquired, constituted their rightto those counterfeits which the house of Rose Légère was maintainedto sell.  For that note, themselves the chattels of conditions, theymight caress or beat; for that, they might take whatever their heartsdemanded.  Was the slave wounded?  Was she ill?  Was she heartbroken?She must smile; she must be one woman to all men.  She must receivethe blows with laughter, the ribaldry, the insults and the curses aswit.  She must pass from this to that--and she must not care.And yet Mary, who was Violet now, could do nothing but take as finalthe conclusion that Rose had drawn for her.  To return home, even ifshe had the money, would be impossible, because to do so would be tocourt her father\\'s anger and her mother\\'s shame, with no hope ofeither pardon or justification.  To go out into the cheerless streetthat sent its growling echoes up to her curtained window would be,she was assured, to deliver herself to arrest or starvation.  She wasignorant and young.  With no knowledge of the laws and the charitiesof the monster town, she saw only that the former, in uniform, was aback-door friend of her keepers, and she was told that the latternever helped before they first publicly burned upon their victims\\'brows the thenceforth ineradicable brand of infamy.  Without therewas, at the least, hunger, drudgery and disgrace; at the most,starvation, jail, death.  Within, where fresh wounds meant butlittle, there obtained, under only a velvet-pawed tyranny, atolerable democracy of disrepute, an equality of degradation, wherefood, at any rate, and shelter and raiment were certain, and whereold scars and fresh bruises were hidden from the world: the price wasno more than supine acquiescence.Anything like financial independence was, of course, impossible: theslaves of Rose Légère were as much slaves as any mutilated black manof the Congo, or any toil-cramped white man in a factory.  Theirwages were paid to the supervisor, their few belongings secretlysearched for gratuities, and though one-half of each payment was,theoretically, the portion of the employé, rent and board and_lingerie_ demanded, and must needs secure, prices that left eachwoman hopelessly in debt to the mistress of the house.With her senses in revolt, the mind and body of the newly-christenedViolet came, by insidious degrees, nevertheless to approach somelikeness to adaptability.  Her material wants never went unsupplied,and such intelligence as she possessed began to swing toward thatpoint of view to differ from which could bring nothing save seriousdiscomfort.  To the hope of Max\\'s return she still, in her own heart,clung with that tenacity which only a woman can exert upon anacknowledged impossibility, but she felt even this hope shrinkbetween her clutching fingers, and, doing her best to reason, sheknew that, even should the miracle happen, Max had brought her andleft her here with the intent that she should fulfill her economicdestiny.Too dull to see deeply into causes, she could only accept the slowlynumbing hail of effects.  Until a few days since, she had been achild, and, like most children, the individual at fault in everypersonal catastrophe.  It was thus that she began by blaming herselffor all that had now befallen her; it was only at moments of growththat she turned her anger first against her own parents, then againstthe active agent and finally against his principal, and it would bebut after deeper vision and harder usage that she could see bothherself and them, and the whole company that made them possible, asmere grist in the mill of a merciless machine.And yet for a long time her one passion was the passion of release.Without clothes and money and protection she could understand noescape; but for these means she at last found courage to appeal tothe one source from which she could conceive of their coming.VIAN ANGEL UNAWARESThe man to whom she first spoke, in a stolen instant, descending thedarkened stair, was a small shopkeeper, fat and pliable, beyond theage of violence, and, as he had just told her, a husband and thefather of a girl of her own age.\"Listen,\" she said, with one trembling hand upon his shoulder, \"Iwant you to do me a favor.\"\"Anything you say, Violet,\" he chuckled.\"Don\\'t talk so loud, then.  I--I want you to take me out of here.\"The man looked at her, through the rosy twilight, in a flatteredbewilderment.\"Like me as much as that, do you?\" he sparred.\"You don\\'t understand.  Of course, I like you; but what I meantwas----\"He interrupted her, his fat fingers complacently patting her cheek.\"It\\'s not me that don\\'t tumble to the facts,\" he said; \"it\\'s you.  Itold you I was a family man.  I couldn\\'t put you anywhere.\"\"I don\\'t mean that.  I mean----\"But again he cut in upon her labored explanation, his commercial mindtraveling along lines in which it had been forced all his life totravel, and his pride entrenching itself behind the trivial rampartof his income.\"You girls!\" he laughed, in palpable deception.  \"You all think I\\'vegot a lot of money.  Why, there ain\\'t no use thinkin\\' you can bleedme.  I\\'m a business man, an\\' I do everything on a straight businessbasis, but I wouldn\\'t rent a flat for the finest of you that everwalked Fourteenth Street.\"Violet\\'s answer was brief.  That she should have given her confidenceto such a beast, that such a beast should continue to thrive in theworld that was closed to her, and that, her pitiable confidence oncegiven, she should be so grossly misinterpreted--these things sent ared rage rushing to her now always incarnadined cheeks.  She gave theshopkeeper a push that nearly sent him rolling to the foot of thestairs.\"Get away from me!\" she whispered hoarsely.  \"Get away!  I wouldn\\'thave you for a gift!\"The man stumbled and gripped the rose-colored lamp upon thenewel-post, which swayed, under his rocking weight, like a palm-treein a storm.  He gasped for breath, got it, and, shaking his fistupward through the shadows, began to bellow forth a storm of oathsthat, for foulness, utterly outdid the ejaculations to which, fromboth sexes, Violet was already becoming accustomed.\"You come down here,\" he courageously shouted, \"and I\\'ll give you theworst beating you ever had in your life!  Nice place, this is!  I\\'llhave it pinched--you see if I don\\'t!  You can\\'t make an easy thingout o\\' me!  You\\'ve robbed me, anyhow.  You\\'ll get what\\'s comin\\' toyou!\"--And he ended with the single epithet to which those four wallswere unaccustomed.Rose ran out from the parlor.\"Shut up, you!\" she commanded of the disturber, in a low tone thatnevertheless compelled obedience.  \"What\\'s the trouble, Violet?\"Violet leaned against the stair-wall, half-way up, her burning handspressed to her burning face.  She was mad with anger and shame, butshe was also afraid.\"You heard him,\" she gasped.\"Yes,\" snapped the visitor, his voice uncontrollably resuming itsformer timbre, \"and you heard me, too!\"The mistress is, of necessity, always, in a crisis, against the slave.\"Well,\" said Rose, \"tell me what she done.\"Violet, however, saw at once the necessity of changing the issue.\"He says he\\'s been robbed!\" she called down the stairs.  And then sheran after her words, and stood under the lamp, facing them both, herarms extended, the flowing sleeves trembling with the emotion thatthey covered but could not conceal.  \"Search me!\" she commanded.  \"Ifyou think I took a cent of yours, search me!\"She was a vision that brought conviction with it.Before the sputtering visitor could correct the situation, Rose had,perhaps against her will, been converted.  She took the man\\'s hatfrom the hall-rack at her side, put it on his head, opened thestreet-door, and gently propelled him through it.\"You\\'re drunk,\" she said, \"an\\' you\\'d better get out before I call thecop.  There ain\\'t no badger business in this house, an\\' don\\'t youforget it!\"She shut the door, and turned calmly to Violet.\"How much did you get?\" she asked.\"Why, Miss Rose, you know----\"\"I mean what did you touch him for?  You mustn\\'t play that sort ofgame here: it gives the house a bad name.  But just this once we\\'lldivide up an\\' not say anything more about it.\"Violet\\'s eyes opened wide.\"I didn\\'t steal a penny,\" she declared.Rose regarded her with a softening countenance.\"Word of honor?\" she asked.\"Word of honor,\" vowed Violet.\"All right, but even if you do touch them, you mustn\\'t ever let them_think_ you do.  A man\\'ll forgive you for hurtin\\' him anywhere but inhis pocket-book.--You\\'re all worked up, dearie.  Come on out to thekitchen an\\' have a bottle of beer.\"As they were pouring the drinks, a heavy foot sounded in the outsidepassageway and a careful four knocks followed upon the rear door.\"That\\'s Larry,\" said Rose, and drew the bolt.A policeman\\'s hat was poked through the doorway, followed by aflushed, genial Irish face, and a tall, hulking body in regulationuniform.\"I\\'m terrible dry,\" grinned Larry.\"Then you\\'ve come to the right shop,\" was Rose\\'s greeting.  \"We\\'rejust havin\\' a little drop ourselves.  Larry, this is my new friend,Violet.\"The policeman grinned again, and sat carefully upon the edge of akitchen-chair, in evident fear that his bulk might prove too greatfor it.\"Glad to know you,\" he said.\"Larry\\'s on this beat nights,\" Rose explained to Violet, \"an\\' him an\\'the lieutenant look after us--don\\'t you, Riley?\"\"Well, what use is a frind if he don\\'t take care of yez, Miss Rose?We do the bist we can.\"\"I know that.--What\\'ll it be, Larry?  We\\'re takin\\' beer, but there\\'swine on the ice if you want it.\"\"I\\'ll just have a small drap of liquor, ma\\'am, please,\" said Riley.Rose poured and handed to him a glass of whiskey.\"When you came by,\" she inquired, \"did you see a fat man throwin\\'fits in our gutter?\"\"Why, I did not.  Have ye been afther havin\\' a rumpus the night?\"\"Oh, no--only that fat little fellow that keeps the jewelry-storearound the corner.  He was drunk, an\\' I threw him out.  If he triesto get gay, let me know, will you?\"\"Of course I\\'ll let ye know--an\\' here\\'s to your very good health,ma\\'am an\\' miss.--But you may rist aisy; that there won\\'t be nothrouble.\"\"I know that: he\\'s too scared of his wife.--Have another, won\\'t you?\"The officer rose.\"No, thank ye kindly,\" he said.  \"I wanted but the drap, ma\\'am.\"\"And how are Mrs. Riley and the children?\"Larry\\'s face became a web of smiling wrinkles.\"Grand,\" he said; \"the auld woman\\'s grand--you ought to see her inthe new silk dress I bought \\'er the day--all grane wid fancytrimmin\\'s from Six\\' Avenoo.  An\\' the kiddies is thrivin\\'.  Cecilia\\'llsoon be havin\\' to go to work an\\' help the family funds, she\\'s thatsthrong and hearty, an\\' young Van Wyck is such a divil that theteacher throwed him out of school.  He\\'s licked all the b\\'ys in hisclass, an\\' I think he\\'ll end as a champeen pug.\"He went out, still smiling, and, as he did so, Violet saw Rose, afterstooping hurriedly, place in his hands a yellow bill.  As the doorclosed, there came into the younger woman\\'s eyes the question thatshe would not have dared to ask.\"Yep,\" nodded Rose, \"that\\'s my week\\'s pay for what they callprotection.\"\"Isn\\'t he afraid to take it?\" Violet, thus encouraged, inquired.\"The man above him isn\\'t afraid to take two-thirds of it,\" said Rose,\"an\\' the best of it goes past him to the district boss--it\\'s theregular system with the regular prices.  Oh, no, he ain\\'t afraid; an\\'if you ever tried to live on a copper\\'s pay, you\\'d soon be afraid notto take it.\"Violet, returning to the parlor, bit her lip: there was indeed smallhelp to be had from the law.Small help, either there or elsewhere.  She turned, naturally, onlyto the seemingly more prosperous customers, but, even by them, shewas met with smiling incredulity: her story was so hackneyed that itcould not be true.\"It\\'s all right enough to want to get out of here,\" said her sagestadviser, who at least paid her the rare compliment of credence; \"buthow are you going to live after you get out?  You can\\'t go home; youhaven\\'t got any trade; you can\\'t cook; without a recommendation youcan\\'t get even a job at general housework or in a factory.\"He was a quiet, middle-aged widower that said this, an infrequentvisitor, a chief clerk in one of the departments of a large insurancecompany, with a reputation for liberal kindliness at Rose\\'s and, inhis own little world, a position of some influence.\"You get me out,\" said Violet, \"an\\' I\\'ll do the rest.\"But here again the gate was barred against her.  The clerk wasburdened with a good name and a place of trust.  He could riskneither the one nor the other.  He was sorry, genuinely sorry--shesaw that; but what could he do?It was an evening or two later that she found her first pale ray ofencouragement, and she found it in the person of Philip Beekman, thatsame young Beekman to whom Fritzie had casually referred.Beekman described himself, with some accuracy, as a person of goodfamily and bad morals.  \"We are getting so confounded poor,\" he usedto say, \"that I sometimes doubt the former; but I have constantvisible evidence of the latter, and so I cling to that as the onesure thing in this uncertain life.\"  Had he but seen the facts, hemight well have considered his derelictions as the result of hisparentage.  At her divorce, his mother had been awarded the custodyof her only child, and, now that she had remarried, Philip was forcedto play that neither uncommon nor congenial rôle--the part of theyoung man with too little training to earn a living and too muchancestry to marry one.\"After all,\" he said, as he sat with Violet in the many-colored backparlor, a half-empty bottle between them, his usually pale faceaglow, his gray eyes filmy, and his black hair tumbled by theconstant passage through it of his long, nervous fingers--\"after all,you see, you and I are in the same boat.  You can\\'t get out because,if you do, the sharks will eat you, and I daren\\'t get out because Ican\\'t swim.\"Always haunted by the fear that, in some manner, her true story mightreach her own town and her own people, Violet had told him only asmuch as she dared, and what she had said had moved his impulsivegenerosity.\"But anyway,\" he insisted, \"you can do one thing that I can\\'t.\"She clutched at the straw.\"What\\'s that?\" she asked.\"You can get help from shore.\"\"How do you mean?\"\"I mean that if you\\'ll write a letter home, I\\'ll mail it.\"She shook her head: the straw crumpled in her fingers.\"There\\'s no use of that,\" she said.\"Of course there is.  After all, your father\\'s your father, you see,and I don\\'t know a father that wouldn\\'t help his daughter out of thesort of mess you\\'ve got into.\"\"I know one,\" said Violet, grimly.\"Not till you try him, you don\\'t.\"\"Yes, I do.  If you was in my place would your father----\"\"Which father?\" laughed Beekman.  \"My one won\\'t have anything to dowith me because I live with the other, and the other won\\'t haveanything to do with me because I\\'m the son of his predecessor.--Youtake my advice and write home.\"\"I\\'d never get an answer.\"She spoke in an even tone, but there was no mistaking the tragedythat underlay it.Beekman looked at her and blinked queerly.  He brought his fist downsmartly among the jangling glasses.\"It\\'s a rotten shame!\" he said.  \"A dirty, rotten shame!  Why, don\\'tyou know that that yid who got you into this makes a business of suchthings?  Don\\'t you know there\\'s a whole army of them that do?  I wishto the Lord I could do something, but there isn\\'t a policeman or amagistrate in the city who\\'d listen to me--they know too well wherethey get the jam for their bread and butter--and I can\\'t get a jobfor even myself, let alone you!\"She had not, however, heard his last sentence.  Her blue eyes wide,she was hanging on his reference to Max.\"A business?\" she repeated.  \"Do you mean that men make money--thatway?\"\"Of course I do.\"  The film passed suddenly from Beekman\\'s eyes,leaving them alert with purpose.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"there is onething I can do, and I don\\'t know anything that I\\'d enjoy more: yougive me that little kyke\\'s name, and I\\'ll push his face out of theback of his head!\"Then there happened a strange thing.  She had long guessed and nowshe knew, but guessing or knowing, she would not believe.  As muchfor her own sanity as for Max\\'s safety, she lied.\"The name he gave me,\" she said, \"wasn\\'t his right one.  It wasn\\'teven one he mostly used.  And I never knew no other.\"Beekman raised his hands in more than mock despair, and got up to go.\"Well,\" he declared, \"I don\\'t know what I can do for you.  If I gotinto any scandal, it would punch the last hole in my meal-ticket.\"Violet, who was becoming accustomed to such replies, smiled kindly.\"I don\\'t want you to get into no trouble for me,\" she said.\"I know you don\\'t, and I couldn\\'t be any use if I did.  But I\\'llpromise you this: I\\'ll keep my eyes open, and if anything does turnup, I\\'ll be Johnny-on-the-spot, all right.\"\"Thank you,\" said Violet.\"And look here,\" pursued Beekman, \"I know that it\\'s all rot to expectyou to walk out of here without friends or a job; I know that, unlessyou\\'ve got one or the other, you\\'re just simply in jail here; but ifI can\\'t get you anything, there must be those who can.  Why don\\'t youtalk to the coal-men, or the gas-inspectors, or--I tell you, I\\'veseen that tow-headed Dutchman who leaves the beer here.  He looksstraight, and he stops at the door.  Why don\\'t you talk to him?  He\\'sthe sort that would know of a job for--for----\"Beekman hesitated, blushing like a schoolboy.\"For my sort?\" asked Violet.  \"Maybe he is.  Thank you.  Anyhow I\\'llsee.\"And she did see.  When Beekman left her, pressing into her hand thelast piece of money that he would have for a week, he gave her at thesame time so much of hope.  Those who seemed rich could not help her;she would appeal to those who were poor.She was up early and in the kitchen the next morning at the hour whenshe knew the brewery-wagon would stop outside, and she sent the ebonCassie on an errand to the corner pharmacy.  The maid had scarcelyclosed the door before Violet was summoned to open it to the Germanof whom Beekman had spoken.Philip had observed well.  The brewery\\'s driver, who stood whistlingin the areaway, was a short, stocky man with the neck and arms of agladiator and the round, smiling face of a child.  His blue overallsand dark cloth cap accentuated the fairness of his hair, and hisround inquiring eyes were alive with continual good-humor.  He hadjust piled a half-dozen cases of beer beside the doorway.Violet, in her crimson kimona, took from the table the money that hadbeen left for him.\"Good-morning,\" she said as she handed him the bills.He accepted the money with his left hand and, with his right, raisedhis cap from his clustering curls.  His lips ceased whistling, halfregretfully.\"Goot-mornin\\',\" he replied, smiling.\"Won\\'t you come in and have a drink?\" asked Violet, adopting Rose\\'sform of salutation.\"No, t\\'ank you,\" the German shook his head.  \"I neffer trinks nussingbud beer.\"\"Well,\" said Violet, \"we have lots of that now.\"\"Und I neffer trink dot till tinner.\"There was an awkward pause.  The German, not knowing how to leavewithout seeming rudeness, was shifting his weight from one heavilyshod foot to the other.  The woman, uncertain how to say the wordsshe wanted to say, remained with her hand upon the knob.\"You don\\'t?\" she awkwardly repeated.\"No, und so I t\\'ink--I t\\'ink I besser be goin\\',\" he hurriedlyconcluded, and began to turn on his heel.The necessity for quick action roused her.\"Wait,\" she said.  And then, as he faced her again in mute wonder,she pressed another bill into his hand.  \"I want you to help me,\" shecontinued.  \"I want to get a job somewhere, and I don\\'t want MissRose to know nothing about it.\"He looked from the bill to her, still wondering.\"So-o?\" he responded.\"Yes, I want work--some other kind of work--and I thought perhaps youmight\"--her voice faltered--\"might know of some kind.\"The German\\'s mobile face underwent a quick change.  Firstastonishment and then something not far removed from tears came intohis childlike eyes.  He crushed the bill in his big red fist.\"So-o?\" he repeated.\"Yes, I--you understand that I must have friends or a job if I am toget away from here, and I thought you might know of something.\"The German bobbed his curls.\"I know dot right vell,\" he said; \"bud I don\\' know no tshob chustnow.\"Violet\\'s face darkened.\"All right,\" she answered, \"I only hoped maybe----\"\"Look here, miss,\" the driver cut in with a note of ready feeling inhis voice.  \"You mean all dot?\"\"All what?\"\"About geddin\\' ozzer--aboud a real tshob.\"\"If I had the clothes and a place I\\'d go this minute.\"\"Vell, den, listen.  I\\'ve chust god a new blace; I\\'m goin\\' to bebar-tender ofer on Segond Avenue, bud I gan send back here if I hearanysing.--Your name?\"\"Violet--just Miss Violet.\"\"All righd, Miss Violet, I know some more aboud dese blaces like disdan you maybe t\\'ink, und I guess maybe I gan do somesing.  Nex\\'Sunday I dake my girl to Coney, und den ve\\'ll dalk sings ofer undve\\'ll see vhat Katie says.\"In spite of the promised delay and the growing habit of doubt,Violet\\'s face kindled.\"You\\'re good,\" she said simply, \"and I\\'ll trust you.\"\"Oh, I make nussing,\" replied the German, smiling once more, \"budchust you vait: Katie gan fix it; she gan fix anysing.\"Before Violet could reply, he had resumed his whistling and run downthe alleyway; and she saw that he had tossed back her money on thetopmost beercase.VIIHOLIDAYThat Sunday morning in his single, dark, narrow room, HermannHoffmann, the erstwhile driver of a brewery-wagon and the comingSecond Avenue barkeeper, arose with the dawn, just as if it had beena workday morning, and set about his elaborate toilet, whistling.To the casual eye there would have seemed little in his surroundingsto inspire any lyric joy.  The cell-like apartment, which was theonly spot on earth that Hermann might call his home, was a back roomon the top floor of a damp and gloomy tenement in a filthy courtrunning off Houston Street near Avenue A.  Only at noon did the palesunlight strain into that court, crowded all morning with malariousdogs and dirty, toddling babies solemnly, but vainly, trying to learnhow to play, and echoing all through the black night now to thecurses of scarred, slinking tiger-cats, now to the staggeringfootsteps or the brawling oaths of drunkards reeling homeward throughthe evil-smelling darkness, and again to the piercing cry of a womanin mortal agony or mortal fear.Robbins\\'s Row was no place for a policeman after nightfall, andscarcely a safer place for a stranger by day.  From its sagging fileof dirty, paper-patched windows, more or less feminine shapes leanedout, calling gossip to their neighbors, and hauling at the pulliedropes that, crossing the street, spread above the pedestrians atossing, parti-colored canopy of \"wash.\"  You entered it by climbingthree rotting wooden steps, by stumbling through a wet hall, where ablue-burning gas-jet accentuated the sense of perpetual midnight, andyou could reach the room of Hermann Hoffmann only by a perilous climbof six flights of stairs.That room was as bare as any in the building.  It looked out, by asingle slit in the wall, upon a light-shaft, strangely misnamed.  Itsonly furniture was a cot, a wooden-seated chair, a washstand, and,bearing comb and brushes and shaving-utensils, one of those pinebureaus the drawers of which may be opened in ten minutes, andclosed, if you are lucky, in fifteen.  Yet the note of the place wasthe note of order and of neatness; the bare floor was clean, and,against the fresh and brightly papered wall, there hung here a calicocurtain that hid the tenant\\'s wardrobe and there a single shelfbearing only, as if it were an altar consecrated to one holy object,a thumbed and dog\\'s-eared copy of \"Das Kapital.\"Hermann plunged his ruddy face, whistling, into a bowl of water anddrew it out, more ruddy and whistling still.  Even the author of thatportentous volume on the book-shelf used to sing \"Strausbourg,\" andHermann\\'s single anthem was \"Die Wacht Am Rhein.\"Still pursuing that inspiring music, he turned to the bureau andbegan to shave the yellow down from his cheeks and chin.  Thrustbetween the exaggerating mirror and its frame were twophotographs--the one, a trifle faded, of a matronly, kindly woman ofhis own race, perhaps fifty years old, stiffly arrayed in a silkdress rigorously American, and the other, a new one, that of a younggirl in a great hat and unmistakably Manhattan dress, a young girlwith a pretty, piquant face of that distinctively American type--theIrish.  Perhaps these photographs distracted the German\\'s attention;perhaps it was only that no man living can successfully whistle andshave at one and the same time.  At any rate, his hand shook, and therazor cut a light gash in his upper lip.He flung the offending blade from him, and it struck the mirror,cracking the glass across one corner.\"Ach, Gott,\" he smiled, as he staunched the blood with a heavypressure through a rough towel; and then, in the English that he usedeven in his soliloquies: \"Dey say now dot means bad luck fer sevenyear.  Lucky is\\'t dot I am not suberstitious!\"And then, undisturbed, he quietly resumed his whistling, finishedshaving, sleeked down his rebellious tow-colored curls, got into anewly pressed brown suit and yellow shirt, donned a high collar andsalmon tie, and, setting a carefully brushed derby upon his head,descended to the narrow street, the strains of \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\"lingering behind him through the darkened hallway.To accomplish the purpose of his early rising, he took the ThirdAvenue elevated to the Forty-second Street station.  There he boughttwo bouquets of carnations--one pink and the other white--and boardeda suburban train, which bore him, at last, to one of those littlestations that New York, which has so small time for remembrance, hasselected for the hiding of its dead.In the warm sunlight of the spring morning, Hermann picked hiscertain way among the green grass and the white-roofed habitations ofthe sleepers, until he came upon a little plot, by no means thecheapest or more obscure in the burying-ground, and there, his lipsstill pursed, but silent now, took off his shining derby and pausedbefore the solitary white stone.  With much that was unaffectedlyreverent, he knelt, according to his weekly custom, and placed thewhite carnations on the grave, and with a great deal that was just asunaffectedly proud, he read, also according to that custom, theinscription cut upon the white stone that he had purchased with what,when he paid the bill, happened to be his last dollar:  Here In Peace  Lies The Body Of  WlLHELMINA HOFFMANN,  Widow Of Ludwig Hoffmann,  Of Andernach, Rhenish Prussia,  Who Dep\\'t\\'d This Life, Jan. 10, 1907.  ------  \"_Wait thou, wait thou; soon thou shall rest also._\"The inscription was in English, but when he had finished reading it,the dead woman\\'s son said, under his breath, the Lord\\'s Prayer in thelanguage of Luther, as she had taught it him.\"She liked me to pray,\" he shamefacedly explained to thecircumambient atmosphere, as if prayer in any tongue were acompromise with his principles.  \"Und vhile I\\'m aboud it, I mighd asvell use de old langwage.  If the Herr Gott listens at all, He\\'d hearit some besser in de vay She said it.\"And then he resumed his hat and his anthem, and returned to town.Katie Flanagan was waiting for him as he came hurrying up the stepsfrom the subway at Park Place--the piquant, pretty girl of thephotograph, in black, because her parents had died not long since,but in black just as elaborate as her slender purse would permit,because she knew the full value of her raven hair and blossomingcheeks and tender eyes of Irish blue.\"Ach,\" gasped Hermann, \"hof I kep\\' you a long time vaitin\\'?\"\"Only about as long as you mostly do,\" she answered.  Her voice waslike her eyes, and she spoke with but the charming hint of a Galwaybrogue.The German\\'s cheeks burned with humiliation.\"I\\'m sorry,\" he apologized.  \"I god up early to be on dime, bud detrain vas lade from the cem\\'t\\'ry in.\"She understood and smiled.\"It\\'s only five minutes I\\'ve been here,\" she confessed.\"Und I brought you a few bosies, Katie.  I d\\'ought maybe----\"\"Oh!\" she seized the carnations with a laugh of delight, and buriedher nose in them.  \"It\\'s good y\\'are to think of such things,Hermann--and a bad lad that y\\'are to spend the money so!\"They were making their way toward the Bridge, the sturdy Hoffmannshouldering a passage through the momentarily swelling Sunday morningcrowd.\"Dot liddle makes nussing,\" he proudly protested.  \"To-morrow I beginad my new tshob.\"\"But that,\" said Katie, \"won\\'t pay you hardly wan dollar a weekmore\\'n the brewery did.  I dunno, but I think----\"There, however, her protest, for the moment, ended.  They werecaught, clinging together, in the whirlpool of the entrance; carriednearly off their feet, rushed by the ticket-window with a quickexchange of small coin, and, a few minutes later, were battling theirway among the press into a waiting Coney Island train.In the last charge, Hermann, his lips puckered in the battle-hymn,did heroic service.  While Katie hung tightly to one arm, he usedmanfully the elbow of the other; pushed a guard to the right; shovedtwo cigarette-smoking youths to the left; wriggled through thealready crowded platform and shot into one of the coveted\"cross-seats.\"  Much of the park would not be open for a month ormore to come, but New York was already clamoring for its playground.Katie, flushed and triumphant, sank beside him, and busied herselfwith the task of straightening her big black hat.  Hermann watchedher in frank admiration as she sat there, her arms raised to herhead, in that pose which, of all others, is the most becoming to hersex.\"What are you lookin\\' at?\" she archly wondered, casting a smiling,sidelong, blue glance at him.But before her the strong man was a timid child.\"Ad de brettiest bicture in a whole vorld,\" he stammered.Katie laughed again.\"Och,\" she said in gratified disapproval, \"there sure must be aCastle Blarney somewhere on the Rhine.  What favor are you wantin\\' toask me now, I wonder.\"Once he had started, Hermann was too dogged thus to be retarded.\"It\\'s chust de same old fafor,\" he pleaded, as, with a great creakingof brakes, the train began to swing upon the Bridge.  \"Now I god mynew tshob, Katie, there gan\\'t for nod hafin\\' our veddin\\' be no goodreason, gan dere?\"\"There\\'s one,\" she said, still delighting in her coquetry; \"there\\'sone reason.\"\"Vat is \\'t?\"\"Its name is Father Kelly.\"\"Katie, you von\\'t led dot gount!\"\"I will so.\"\"Und I haf to gome into your church, und--und all dem d\\'ings?\"\"You do that.\"Hermann squirmed; but he knew of old that from this point she wasneither to be persuaded nor driven.  It was a discussion that theyhad held many a time before, and every time she would give him noanswer to his suit until he should surrender in this particular.Now, however, he considered himself about to set foot upon thehighroad to prosperity, and the prosperous can ill afford to skimpmagnanimity.\"_All_ righd,\" he at last somewhat ruefully conceded, though withcertain mental reservations into which it seemed then unnecessary toenter: \"I\\'m a strong von, und hof stood a lot a\\'ready, so I t\\'ink Igan stand dot too.  I\\'ll do it.\"He took her by surprise.\"Promise?\" she asked.\"Sure I bromise.\"\"No backin\\' out whatever happens?\"\"No packin\\' oud.\"\"Well, God bless you then.\"There was a catch in her voice as she said it.  Into her lonely,hardworking life, this strong, soft-hearted, poor and cheerful Germanhad brought about all the sunshine that she had latterly known, andshe could think of nothing better than to give him the answer that hewas so honestly anxious to hear.  But, though he had become more andmore to her from the first evening when he had seized her as she wasfalling from the platform of a surface-car that had started tooquickly on its way, she had seen enough of the warfare with povertyin her own family to resolve that she would not marry until she couldcontribute her share to the wages of the resulting household, and nowshe had neither a position nor the immediate likelihood of obtainingone.  It was hard, but she was used to hardship, and so, because shemust not cry, she smiled.Hermann tried to grasp her hand, but she easily eluded him.\"Den, vhen do ve say?\" he eagerly demanded.Much as it hurt her to hurt him, she laughed her answer:\"As soon as I get me fingers on a job that\\'ll pay me six dollars aweek, we\\'ll have Father Kelly say the words for us.\"\"But Katie\"--he used to say \"Gatie\" until she had teased him out ofit--\"you don\\' mean dot!  You said--you dold me--you bromise----\"He floundered in the breakers of amazement.  She turned her faceaway, and looked out of the window at the gigantic mockery of Libertyin the harbor; but she could not find it in her heart long to remainsilent.  She faced him once more.\"It\\'s no use, Hermann,\" she said, her eyes very big and serious.\"Here y\\'are goin\\' to Schleger\\'s place with your first good chance ata way as\\'ll lead you to somethin\\' worth workin\\' for--you saidyourself it might end in a café o\\' your own--an\\' to get there you\\'llbe needin\\' every blessed cent you can save.  Do you think now I couldlook at meself in the glass mornin\\'s if I married you an\\' kep\\' youdown?  No, thank God, I\\'m not so bad as that.\"He sputtered toward a protest, but she waved him down.\"Now don\\'t be tellin\\' me that two can live as cheap as one,\" shesaid.  \"I seen that pleasant lie nailed this many a year, an\\' I knowmore about housekeepin\\' in five minutes than you can learn in alifetime.  Things was plenty bad five years past, an\\' now they\\'reworse yet.  What rent is you know, an\\' what clothes is you can\\'t evenguess.  Here\\'s beefsteak at twenty-two cents the pound; veal up tothirty an\\' still goin\\' up.  The papers make a fuss an\\' get the pricesdown three cents for three days, an\\' then the dealers put them upagain when none\\'s lookin\\'.  An\\' as for eggs, you can pay seventy-fivecents a dozen for them, winters, with the hour an\\' minute of thelayin\\' stamped on them, if you\\'re a millionaire, or you can get ninefor a quarter if you hold your nose.\"The hopeful Hermann shook his blonde head.\"But Katie,\" he said, \"I don\\' gare if I neffer ged a gafé off my own.I don\\' vant a gafé: I vant you.\"She smiled again.\"You flatter me by the choice,\" she said; \"but if we can get alongwithout the drink, we can\\'t get along without a bite to eat now an\\'then.  No, Hermann-boy, it\\'s no use, I\\'m tellin\\' you.  I seen ittried.  Me father swang a pick and me mother took in washin\\'--whenshe could get it--an\\' even then it wouldn\\'t work: the one would havestarved to death if the third rail hadn\\'t got him, an\\' poor motherkilled herself tryin\\' to keep her an\\' me.  It won\\'t work, an\\' I knowit.\"While the train hurried above the dead level of Brooklyn houses, outthrough the suburban monstrosities and across the dunes, theoptimist, still an optimist, renewed his endeavors to find the chancefor lodging his own arguments; but all the while Katie continued tooverwhelm him with a flow of errors.  They had almost reached thesandy island before Hermann, still stubbornly hopeful, elected todrop the subject for the present, and took up, in its stead, thestory of Violet.He spoke simply, which is to say forcibly, and he had anunderstanding, and therefore sympathetic, audience.  Katie\\'s faceimmediately softened.\"The poor child!\" she murmured.  \"An\\' don\\'t I know what it is?  I\\'veseen them go under, here one an\\' there another, hungry or overworked,every mother\\'s daughter of them.  There was Molly Ryan, as good agirl as you\\'d find in a day\\'s search of the parish, left alone withno one to put clothes on her back; an\\' pretty Agnes Donovan--out ofwork for four months--her as died in the City Hospital; an\\' GiuliaFortuni, whose father kept a fruit-stand by the Grand Street \"L\"station.--What can we do for her, Hermann-boy?\"\"Dot\\'s vat I vanted to ask you, Katie,\" said Hoffmann.  \"She has tohof friends und vork first of all.\"\"Friends she has right here; but work she must have whether or no.  Ibegin me old search for meself in the mornin\\', an\\' I\\'ll keep eye an\\'mouth ready to get a job for her.\"Cynically hopeless and city-wise in regard to her own chances,Katie\\'s Celtic soul warmed to something of Hermann\\'s optimism in thecause of a sister.  She began planning at once, and when the traindrew up outside the tunnel-shed, she had the absent Violetestablished as a cloak-model in the big Lennox Department-Store, andengaged to marry a floor-walker.And then Coney--Coney the sweetly reasonable in price and theextravagantly generous in provision--crowded out of her mind, forthat day, all thoughts save the thought of itself.A great many years ago--oh, a very great many years ago!--when youwere a little boy, your father took you to the county-fair.  Youremember it, even yet, as a purple day in the glad calendar of yourchildhood: the blood cattle, the show of farm implements, the prizepumpkins, the side-shows with their fat ladies and skeletongentlemen, and the suave individual that put a bean under a cup andthen, for a dollar, showed your shrewd parent that it was underanother.  But above all you remember the crowd.  Never before had youseen so many people in one place, never realized that there were somany people in the world; and even now, out of the past, you can hearan awed voice saying:\"There are five thousand persons here.\"Well, back home, the county-fair, thank heaven, continues to grow.Cattle are sleeker and pumpkins larger; the fat ladies weigh more andthe thin gentlemen less; the shell-game, in one form or another, aidsthe progress of agriculture by making five dollars grow where onlyone grew before.  But, in the meantime, the ugly, delightful\"amusement-park\" has brought the county-fair to the city-limit, andnearly three hundred thousand persons go to Coney Island every day.Early in the season though they were, Katie and Hermann no soonerstepped upon that Surf Avenue which is at once the heart and theaorta of the Island, than they felt, as there they always felt, thatthey had entered upon the Land of Carnival.  The broad, but crowded,way was dancing with the noise of festival, with the clangor of brassbands, the cries of venders, the smell of the circus, the tang of thesea.Here, from mixed drinks to mixed music, went not the thugs andblacklegs, the pallid men and the painted women that would havefilled such a place had it been within the borough of Manhattan.  Intheir stead here drove the cars of generally stolid people ofbusiness and leisure, and here, above all, walked the workers of thecity, the weaker sex and the stronger, seeking holiday.  Thefull-portion hat on the half-portion girl is as familiar to SurfAvenue as to the Waldorf palm-room; care is erased from the tabletsof memory.  On Coney there is no To-morrow.The laughter of the hundreds of children rang out no more freely thandid that of the thousands of their elders.  Mothers with babies intheir arms were young again.  Stately blondes and languorousbrunettes, gracefully seated on the wooden steeds of the score ofmerry-go-rounds, rode with a dignity unsurpassed in Hyde Park or theBois, and never a cowboy at a round-up was more adventurous than theyoung East-Sider mounting a hired horse upon the Pony Track.Every nook had something to sell, and Katie had her day\\'s work inkeeping Hermann from stopping at each booth.  There were miles ofscenic railways on all of which he wished to ride; there were scoresof panorama that tempted him with pictures of every disaster from theSan Francisco fire to the Messina earthquake.  There were thefamiliar canes waiting to be caught with the familiar ring: therewere the familiar chutes to be shot, and the familiar \"galleries\"where the rattle of rifles recalled the battle of the Yalu.  Down onthe beach an army was shouting in the surf, and on every hand alongthe jostling, good-natured street were peanuts and popcorn,\"crispettes\" and \"hot dogs.\"  Upon dozens of polished floors dancerswere slowly revolving with a marvelous ability to distinguish betweenthe time of their own orchestra and that of the band in the caféopposite, and everywhere were picture machines and machines that sang.Cheap it doubtless was, but cheap also in the sense of small cost.Except in the larger cafés, the ordinary drinks sold at only fivecents the glass, and the glasses were not an insult to the drinkers\\'capacity.  Hermann and Katie had their beer at one of the smallerplaces.  They dined for twenty-five cents apiece, without tips, atthe \"Home-Made-Lunch-Room\"; they were twirled and buffeted in aswiftly revolving car down a series of precipitous canvas chasms,paying five cents apiece for the privilege of the shaking-up that, athome, Hermann would have resented with a blow; and they chose thelast seat in the last car of a steep gravity railway, where a manmust hold himself aboard with one arm and his shrieking sweetheartaboard with the other.It was all blatant, all tawdry, all the apotheosis of the ridiculous,all essentially America-at-play; but when, at night, in theelectric-train shooting through the warm darkness, the pair returnedcitywards, it was toward their own hard-earned and with difficultyretained places of shelter that they were going, like children aftera strenuous holiday of make-believe with school to begin upon themorrow; and if, in most of the seats, as in that occupied by Katieand Hermann, girls slept with their heads resting frankly uponsleeping masculine shoulders, it was but a rest before conventionalpartings at home-doorways, the play-day ended for the lonely couch,and the work-day soon to begin.VIIIMR. WESLEY DYKERIn that company of the ignoble army of martyrs over whichcircumstances had given Rose Légère command, there were five members.Besides Mary, who now was Violet, Celeste, whom ancient conditionshad temperamentally predetermined for such service, and Fritzie, whohad chosen a partly moral slavery as less onerous than a whollyeconomic servitude, there was the highly colored Englishwoman Evelyn,who regarded her present station as one of the descending stepsinevitable for everyone that set foot upon the way they all weretreading, and Wanda, a dark little Russian Jewess, who, as soon asshe had landed at the South Ferry from Ellis Island, had fallen intothe hands of the slave-traders, and had thenceforward persistentlystriven upward to the place she now inhabited.For the maintenance of her authority upon these and their patrons,Rose, unlike some of her fellows, did not have to depend upon theassistance of any man quartered in the house.  To the discipline ofthe inmates her system of charge for clothes, food, and shelter wasadmirably suited; for the regulation of the visitors the generallynearby person of big Larry Riley, the policeman, amply sufficed.  Oneother outsider seemed, however, to have a regular connection with theestablishment, and this person early excited Violet\\'s curiosity.Dressed in the extreme of fashion, as fashion is known fromFourteenth Street southward, his gray, almost white, suits alwaysfresh from the pressing-iron, and his flowered tie and ever evidentgay silk handkerchief always glaringly new, this dapper, dark youngman was unmistakably Neapolitan.  His glossy black hair clusteredtight over his forehead; his brown skin shone as if rubbed with oil;his eyes danced like merry, but sinister, bits of coal, and his toored lips were continuously, loosely, patterned to a smile that wasmore nearly contemptuous than good-humored.For at least a part of every evening this Italian, who always enteredthe house from the rear and without the formality of knocking, sat inthe kitchen, drinking his beer with infinite leisure and, in theintervals of her discussions in the parlor, condescended to talk,lazily, with Rose.\"Who is he?\" asked Violet, on what was perhaps the fifth of hisvisits that she had happened to observe.Celeste, to whom the question had been addressed, shrugged her smoothshoulders.\"He ees Angel,\" she answered.\"He don\\'t look like one.\"\"No, not mooch, but hees name, eet ees that: Rafael Angelelli.  Eefhe had the moostache, he would be almost \\'andsome.\"\"Rose acts like she thought a good deal of him as he is.\"\"But why not?\"--Celeste raised her heavy brows.  \"\\'e ees \\'ersweed\\'eart.\"\"He is?\" repeated Violet, who could not yet understand the masculinelover that would batten upon his conquest.  \"I notice he prettynearly lives here, an\\' he never pays out a cent, an\\' never seems towork at anything, an\\' he always wears good clothes.\"\"My child, truly!  That is the reason that I have tol\\' you: \\'e ees\\'er sweed\\'eart.\"\"Well, it\\'s queer,\" said Violet, remembering another caller to whom,though he was a less frequent visitor, Rose was equally attentive.\"I don\\'t think he\\'s half as nice as that fellow who comes here in ataxi--the one that always wears a dress-suit an\\' sits in the backparlor.  He\\'s a swell.\"But at this Celeste grew enigmatic.\"Oh,\" she said, \"that ees deeferent\"--and would say no more.Nevertheless, it happened, not long afterward, when the black Cassiewas absent on her \"evening out,\" that Violet, descending the backstair in unshod feet to steal from the ice-chest--as was hercompanions\\' custom--a quiet bottle of the beer that she had come tolike, was brought to a palpitating stop by the sound, just then, ofRose\\'s and Angel\\'s voices from the kitchen but a few steps below her.The pair were plainly engaged in an important conversation, the womanhurried and frightened, the man cold and obdurate.\"Naw,\" said the Neapolitan; \"I maka naw move out o\\' deesa house.\"\"But he\\'s coming in now, I tell you,\" Rose almost supplicated.\"He\\'ll be in the back-parlor in half a minute, an\\' I\\'ve got to go inan\\' talk to him.\"\"Olla righta; you go; I go alonga you.\"\"You can\\'t do that; you know you can\\'t.  You know how things arewithout my tellin\\' you.  What makes you so stubborn all of a sudden?\"\"I don\\' lika dees Meesta Wesley Dyker.\"\"That\\'s no reason why you should double-cross me.\"\"\\'E\\'s too mucha de fina gentleman.\"\"I don\\'t care what he is; you ought to know what I am.  Do you wantto tear up your own meal-ticket and throw down your easy money?\"\"Easy mon\\'?  You maka de joke!\"The woman\\'s voice noticeably changed.\"Do you mean you want some more coin?\" she asked.The Italian did not answer.\"Because I won\\'t give it to you,\" Rose continued, anger darting intoher still cautiously lowered voice.  \"I know what you\\'re doing withit.  I know you had a girl from a department store out at shows twicelast week, an\\' the second time she had a new dress on.\"Somewhere in the front of the house a door closed heavily.\"\\'E\\'s comin\\',\" the Italian coolly commented.  \"Do you wanta that I goalong in with you?\"As quickly as it had entered, all the anger fled from Rose\\'s voice,and Violet, accustomed to it in command or at satisfied ease, wasamazed now to hear it swaying between terror and genuine affection.\"I didn\\'t mean it!\" Rose pleaded.  \"I didn\\'t believe it when I heardit an\\' I don\\'t believe it now, I know how much it costs a fellow tolive.  Here\\'s another ten-spot.  I--I--you know how I hate Dyker, andAngel, you know that I love you!\"The listener heard Angelelli rise and heard even his voice soften,though probably less with affection than with gratification.\"Now you talka lika de person witha gooda sense,\" he said.  \"Don\\' youlisten to de beega lie no more.  I lika you--nobody but only you.You are de gooda girl.\"There was a whispered word more, and then the kitchen door was softlyshut and Violet heard Rose, going into the next room, welcome thatWesley Dyker who, Violet had, to Celeste, so favorably compared withAngel.The woman on the stairs hesitated.  She wanted to pursue hereavesdropping, and she knew that she could regain her room, shouldthe doorbell ring, before she was likely to be missed; but she wasafraid that, in the maid\\'s absence, Rose might return to the kitchenfor a bottle of wine and discover her.  Accordingly she waited thefew minutes that were required for the first of such errands, and,those over, crept forward to the lighted keyhole, ready to retreat atthe first intimation of danger.She gave her eye precedence over her ear, and, as it chanced thatDyker was sitting directly in the limited shaft of her vision, shewas enabled to get what was her first careful view of him.A man but little beyond thirty, Wesley Dyker\\'s face, which might oncewell have been handsome, was beginning to show that flaccid whitenesswhich must later light to red and glow to purple.  What his mouthmight have told, a crisp, short, brown mustache concealed, but theregularity of his other features lost much of its effect because ofeyes that, though large and steel gray, were heavy-lidded andcalculating.  Nevertheless, Violet\\'s estimate of the man was notwithout justification.  He spoke easily and well in the voice ofeducation; his excellently made evening clothes displayed a figurethat had not yet lost its admirable lines, and even the face--to onethat either had known it during its gradual changes, or to one thatlacked a fund of experience for purposes of comparison--was notwanting in attraction.To the sturdy Rose, whose hand he held and who was looking at himwith what she patently believed to be a tender expression, he wasspeaking with a certain formal politeness that was novel in the earsof the listener.\"You think you can get it?\" Rose was asking.\"I think that I have something more than a fighting chance,\" repliedDyker.\"What does O\\'Malley say?\"\"He is at least as liberal in his promise to me as he is in hispromise to the other man.\"\"And the big chief doesn\\'t yip?\"\"My dear Rose, you should know, by this time, enough of New Yorkpolitics to realize that the first qualification of a big boss is tohold his tongue, and that the present incumbent, whatever his othershortcomings, can always keep quiet as long as he has no pen in hishand.\"Rose freed her hand to pour the wine.\"May I smoke?\" asked Dyker.\"You always ask me that, and you always know you can.\"He bowed and, drawing a cigarette from a plain gun-metal case,lighted it.\"Of course,\" he pursued, \"I expect to win--I always expect to win,because failure may fight its way to a perch on any man\\'s banner, butit\\'s sure to lodge on the standard of the man that sits and waits forit.  But I can\\'t be sure of O\\'Malley.\"\"I guess whatever headquarters orders will go with him, all right.\"\"On the surface, perhaps; but, if he wants to, he can have his owncandidate run on an independent ticket, and then he can quietly knifeme at the polls.\"\"Would he have the nerve?\"\"It is precisely what he did election before last.  I am sure ofthat, and yet nobody has ever been able to prove it.  That is where Ilook for your help.\"Rose took his hand again, and pressed it reassuringly.\"I always take care of my friends,\" she smiled, \"and you sure havebeen good to me.  Where do I come in on this game?\"\"Just yet you don\\'t have to come in at all.  It may be thateverything will be honest and above-board--I trust it will--and inthat case you need not disturb yourself.\"\"But if it ain\\'t?\"\"If it isn\\'t,\"--he looked at her kindly, but keenly, from under hisheavy lids--\"I shall want you to let me know just as soon as O\\'Malleybegins to make preparations for registering voters from this house.\"Rose bent forward and kissed him lightly on his flaccid cheek.\"That\\'s easy,\" she laughed.\"Perhaps, but if you have to go so far at first, you will have to gofarther afterward.\"\"An\\' now?\"\"Just now I want you to keep your ears open for gossip.  You are in aposition to hear a lot: in this house men talk that are dumb outside.\"\"Who are you thinkin\\' of?\"\"Several people, friends of O\\'Malley\\'s.  There\\'s one cheap littlecamp-follower who, I am told, gets around here rather frequently.  Idon\\'t suppose that he\\'s of enough importance to know much, but hewould be worth watching.\"\"What\\'s his name?\"Dyker filled Rose\\'s glass, and poured more wine for himself.\"Angelelli,\" he answered.From the darkened kitchen, Violet, her eye now fast to the keyhole,drew a short breath, and watched Rose as the sophisticated spectatorwatches an emotional actress when she approaches her \"big scene.\"But Rose, still the primitive Teuton of the brewery-calendar, neverquavered.\"Rafael Angelelli?\" she inquired.\"I think so.  He is a little Italian loafer with no work and plentyof money.  You know him, of course?\"\"Sure I know him.  He\\'s in an\\' out of here all the time.  We call him\\'Angel\\'.\"\"Hum.  Well, there are angels and angels, so that name may fit him aswell as any other.  There may be nothing to it, but he does hangabout O\\'Malley a good deal, and it might be worth your while to findout what, if anything, he knows.\"\"That\\'s easy,\" purred Rose.  \"Here\\'s success.\"The pair clinked their glasses, and drained them.\"And--Rose?\" began Dyker.\"Yes?\"\"Neither this little fellow nor any of his crowd knows about--us?\"Rose\\'s placid smile was eminently convincing.\"I guess I know my business,\" she said.\"I dare say you do.  Only don\\'t let him know that you know mine.\"\"Trust me for that, Wes\\' dear.\"\"Because, if O\\'Malley could get hold of it, he would have a ratherformidable weapon.\"\"He doesn\\'t know I ever set my lamps on you.\"\"Good,\" said Dyker; \"and he mustn\\'t know it for a good many months tocome.  Now, then, let\\'s have just one pint more between us--only apint--my dear--and----\"But the woman at the keyhole waited to hear no more.IXTHE COURT OF A MERCHANT-PRINCEWhen that injudicious grasping of the third-rail had snuffed out thelow, but stubborn, flame that a foreman had known as \"Number 12,\" anda few score of human beings had called Michael Flanagan, his wife,Bridget, had looked up from her washtub long enough to refuse theoffer of a hundred dollars, made by the company\\'s claim-adjuster asfull payment for whatever inconvenience she might have beenoccasioned by her husband\\'s demise.  One of those very modern younglawyers, whose livelihood depends upon their study of the newspapers,and the speed of their feet, had arrived at the Flanagan tenementahead of the adjuster.  He had accepted a contingent fee of tendollars, and thereafter, being defeated by the company\\'s expertattorneys in a lower court, refused, as usual, to appeal unless thewidow handed him a further amount of money that was wholly beyond herreach.  So Irish-eyed Katie was put to work, as she should in anycase have been put, and Mrs. Flanagan went on with her washing.The girl\\'s first position was in a second-hand clothing shop on SixthAvenue, where she went to work at eight in the morning and quit athalf-past ten at night.  The stock-in-trade of this place was largelyrevived ball-gowns and opera cloaks, bought, for the most part, fromwomen of so much means as to pretend, at least, that they never worethe same gown twice, and yet of too much thrift to give theirdiscarded clothes to charity.  Its patrons were persons that theoriginal wearers of the gowns would have blushed to meet.  And itsproprietress was a little lynx-eyed, hook-nosed person whose soleobject in life was to induce the former class to sell for less thanthey had intended and to persuade the latter class to buy for morethan they could afford.The virtue of this method she impressed, by precept and example, uponher six girl-clerks, and she raised their profits as they raisedtheir prices of sale.  She told, with a fine pride, how she had onceso conducted a negotiation that a Riverside Drive husband had paidher nearly as much for a dress that he was buying for a Forty-seventhStreet acquaintance as he had first paid for the same dress when itwas made for his wife.But, commissions to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Katie norher companions could earn anything beyond a bare living wage.  Thelure of clothes was always before them; their work was the handlingand the praising of beautiful fabrics beautifully arranged.  Theywere told that they might themselves buy of these at what theproprietress called a mere nothing above the cost price, but what wasreally a considerable increase over it; they wanted to look theirbest among their friends, and their employer insisted that they looktheir best to her patrons; there was not one of the half-dozen clerksthat was not continually from fifteen to a hundred dollars in hermistress\\'s debt.That Katie, like many another making the same fight, escaped furthercontamination, that the contrast between the oppression of thehook-nosed owner on the one hand and the apparent ease and luxury ofher customers on the other, did not tempt her,--for opportunitieswere plenty,--from the station of clerk to purchaser, was due in partto her own sturdy character and to the accident of her own Celtictemper.  Other girls there were who were not so destined, but Mrs.Flanagan\\'s weary feet one day refused to support their possessor, andKatie, knowing well the need of ready money for the doctor and thedruggist, neglected to purchase, even on credit, an expensive blackwalking-suit that was repeatedly called to her attention.\"Say, you\\'d look just grand in this,\" said the psittacidicproprietress, Mrs. Binks.She held the dress extended, putting its best points to the light.And all the other clerks echoed:\"You\\'d look just grand in it, Miss Flanagan!\"\"I would that,\" replied Katie, who was as taciturn to her employer asshe was loquacious to everybody else.\"Why don\\'t you take it?\" asked Mrs. Binks.\"I don\\'t just like it,\" lied Katie.Mrs. Binks blinked her bead-like eyes.  That the girl\\'s reply couldbe true was inconceivable.\"Try it on,\" she suggested.\"Where\\'s the use?  I don\\'t want it.\"\"Oh, try it on anyway.\"\"I\\'ll be too busy, Mrs. Binks.  The customers \\'re startin\\' to pour inthis very minute.\"\"Then try it on at your lunch time.  I\\'ll leave it handy here, overthis chair.\"She did leave it there all day long.  Katie, whose one dress was now,in spite of endless feminine make-shifts, beginning to show wear, hadto go through her task with the baited hook constantly danglingbefore her.  Nevertheless, when the long-delayed closing hourarrived, the suit was just where Mrs. Binks had left it.  Katiecarefully abstained from touching it; she would not even put it away.\"What\\'s this?\" asked the mildly surprised owner, as she stumbled overthe garment.  \"I declare it\\'s that handsome walking-suit I wanted youto have, Miss Flanagan.\"Katie turned and regarded the neglected garment precisely as Mrs.Binks was regarding it.\"Well, well,\" she said, \"and is it, now?\"Her mistress looked at her, again blinking suspiciously.\"Did you try it on?\" she demanded.\"No.\"\"Why not?\"\"I don\\'t think I want it.\"\"It\\'s a fine suit.\"\"It\\'s grand.\"\"But you don\\'t want it?\"\"I don\\'t think I do.\"\"I told you that you could have it for a third off.\"\"I know you did that, Mrs. Binks, and it\\'s thank you I do for yourkindness.\"\"Hum--hum.  I\\'ll take off a dollar more--for you.\"\"Thank you, no, Mrs. Binks.  Good-night, Mrs. Binks.\"This sort of thing went on, with variations, for three days, at theend of which time Mrs. Binks, as she would have phrased theoccurrence, \"came right out with it\"; and for this ceremony she chosethat morning hour when the other girls in the shop had the greatestamount of leisure to observe what happened.\"Miss Flanagan,\" said she, marching up to the thoroughly preparedKatie, and peering hard into the serene Irish eyes of her selectedvictim, \"I like my clerks to look well.\"\"So I\\'ve been noticin\\',\" said Katie.\"An\\' I don\\'t like to speak about it when they don\\'t,\" continued Mrs.Binks.\"You\\'re just that tender-hearted!\"\"But if you girls don\\'t wear good clothes, my customers\\'ll think Idon\\'t treat you right.\"\"How could they now, Mrs. Binks?\"\"And,\" concluded Mrs. Binks, overlooking these interruptions in viewof the crushing climax she was approaching, \"as you\\'ve made up yourmind not to take the hints I\\'ve been givin\\' you, or the fine offersI\\'ve made you, I\\'ve got to say it plainly that you\\'re looking tooshabby to work any more for me.\"Katie smiled her warmest smile.\"Mrs. Binks,\" she replied, resorting again to prevarication, andpresenting the greedily seized money that she still owed heremployer, \"I\\'d begun to be afraid that maybe them was your feelin\\'s,an\\' so yesterd\\'y at lunch time I bought me the exact duplicate ofthat walking-suit you\\'ve been tryin\\' to thrust upon me--only I got itnext door an\\' for half your price.\"Saying this she had walked to the shallow closet in the fitting-room,taken down her hat and coat, put them on, sung \"Good-by\" to herconsternated fellow-workers, and strolled away forever from thatplace of employment.  She went smiling, but, instead of the curt wordthat she generally employed, she administered a hand-slap with heropen palm to a stranger that accosted her on her journey homeward.She got work, after some searching, in a candy shop on Eighth Street,but this she had to relinquish when her mother\\'s speedy illnessdeveloped into a brief and fatal disease.  It was not until the lastnursing, relieved by Hermann\\'s assistance, and the funeral were over,that she could again think of labor, and then it was only to get, ina Fourth Street necktie factory, a small position that she lostbecause she had the effrontery to resent the rather frank overturesof the foreman.Now, although she had told her cheerful lover nothing about it, shehad come to the last ditch.  She had been deceived by advertisements,cheated by employment agencies, denied work by the superintendents ofscores of shops and manufactories.  She was not a skilled laborer,and she had, at first, nothing in the matter of recommendation; shebelonged to no trade union; the rent for her little room wasdangerously overdue; so, also, were the bills of the baker and themilk dealer upon whom alone she was depending for food; all that shecould pledge was in pawn, and, with the soles of her shoes wornthrough almost to her feet, the elaborate mourning costume that shehad been unable to resist was her only badge of material prosperity.Two avenues of escape were open, were even persistently presented,yet she would regard neither.  To take what Hermann pleaded with herto accept, though her hungry heart and her underfed body cried outfor it, would have been, she felt well assured, unfairly to handicapher best friend, and, as for turning into that other way--a way intowhich the streets on every hand seemed so easily to open, she was toowise to consider.\"No thanks,\" she answered in her soul, as she walked by the leeringsatyrs, with her black head erect and her lips compressed--\"not yet,if you please: not yet, nor never, I think, for starvin\\' seems someeasier and a deal quicker, too.\"She had to repeat the words pretty often, for they had come to be asort of incantation, almost a pious ejaculation, against the enemy,and, as her poverty grew and her chances decreased in inverse ratio,the enemy, like vultures flocking to the fatally wounded, seemedstartlingly to increase in force.  At first it was a well-dressedcorps strayed from Broadway or the Avenue; then it was the bank-clerkhurrying to work and the master mechanic hurrying from it; butfinally, so plain are the signs of distress shown upon our faces bythe selves that are besieged, it had become the professionallyemploying, professedly unemployed.Yet at every dawn she renewed her quest, with a glass of blue milkand a bite of bread for breakfast.  Every day and all day she trampedthe long, aching streets.  And every night, despairing but resolute,she came home for her supper of bread and milk and for the sleep ofthe hungry and distressed.It was now a Thursday morning.  The milkman had pounded at her doorand, receiving no answer, had left no milk.  Still gnawing her crust,Katie slunk out of the tenement, and, at the step, was waylaid by therent-collector, a little man with a sharp, white face that toldplainly of his own struggle.  He blocked the exit.\"Good-day to you, Miss Flanagan,\" he said, touching his dirty cap.\"Good-mornin\\', Mr. Woods,\" she answered, aware that the hour for thelast engagement was approaching.The man was one whose business forced him to mince nothing.\"I was comin\\' up to git yer rent,\" he continued.  \"It\\'s three weeksoverdue.\"\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to be askin\\' you to let it run a bit longer,\"said Katie, and her voice, in spite of all resolution, trembled.\"But I\\'ve been an\\' done that twice fer you, Miss Flanagan.  The bossis after me as hard as I\\'m after you--an\\' harder.\"\"I know it.  I--you can\\'t stand him off another week, Mr. Woods?\"\"Nix on the stand-off, miss.\"\"You see, I\\'m--I\\'m out of a job.\"\"I know that, but then you\\'ve been out o\\' one fer a good while now.\"\"Yes, only I rather expect--indeed, I\\'ve been promised one beginnin\\'to-morrow.\"The little man coughed behind a dirty hand.\"That\\'s Friday?\" he asked.\"It is that.\"\"Well, ain\\'t you got your dates mixed?  You told me last week you hada job promised for that Friday.\"Katie surprised even herself: she laughed.\"So I did!\" she said.  \"An\\' of course I was lyin\\' an\\' of course youknowed it.  Oh, well, Woods, man, hold \\'em off for forty-eight hours,an\\' if I don\\'t get work then, I\\'ll--well, I won\\'t bother you no more.\"In the shadowy hallway, she felt his eyes studying her less with evilthan with wonder.\"There ain\\'t many girls with your looks, Miss Flanagan, as\\'d be outof a job as long as you\\'ve been.\"Katie shrugged her shoulders: she was beyond resentment.\"The more pity to \\'em,\" she said.\"Not many,\" repeated Mr. Woods.There was an awkward silence.  The collector paused because he wantedher fully to weigh an implication that he honestly considered tocontain sound advice, and Katie refrained from further comment forthe excellent reason that she had nothing to say.  It was Woods thatat last took up the broken thread.\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do, Miss Flanagan,\" he not unkindlyconcluded; \"I\\'ll hold \\'em off till to-morrow evenin\\', an\\' if by thenyou can pay me a chunk on account, it\\'ll be all right; if youcan\\'t----\"He stood aside, and Katie clapped him warmly on the shoulder.\"You\\'re doin\\' your best, Woods,\" she said, \"an\\' I thank you for it.I\\'ll get the job someways, but not the way you think, an\\'--an\\' Ithank you.\"Only half-way to the corner she met the girl that lived across thehall from her, Carrie Berkowicz, a homely, round-cheeked,brown-haired Lithuanian Jewess, who worked in a shirtwaist factory onTenth Street.\"Say, Katie\"--Carrie prided herself on her colloquial English, as shelearned it in the night-classes in the Rand School--\"were you stilllooking for a job?\"Katie nodded.\"Well, say, I just this minute passed Emma Schrem, an\\' she says CoraCostigan is quitting her job at the Lennox store to-day to be marriedto-morrow.  Why don\\'t you pull up there and try for it?\"Try for it?  Katie could scarcely stop to thank her rescuer beforeshe had turned northward.  There was no longer left her even the fivecents necessary for carfare, and, though she was faint with hungerand shaking with fear lest her tardiness should lose her this slimopportunity, she was forced to walk.  Facing a fine rain blown infrom the Sound, she walked up Second Avenue, and finally, turningwestward to the shopping quarter now crowded with salesgirls on theirhurried way to work, she entered, by the dark employés\\' door, thelarge department-store of Joshua N. Lennox, merchant andphilanthropist.A dozen quick inquiries rushed her, wet and weary, but flushed by herwalk and radiant with the excitement of the race, into the presenceof the frock-coated, pale-faced, suave-mouthed Mr. Porter, the tall,thin man, with the precision of a surgeon and the gravity of aSunday-school superintendent, to whose attention, it appeared, suchpleas as hers must be brought.  Mr. Porter, who had grayside-whiskers, which he stroked with white hands, listened injudicial calm to what she had to say.\"Just fill out this application-blank,\" he remarked as, breathless,Katie ended her little speech.They were in a dim, bare office under the street, the man at aroll-top desk lighted by a green-shaded incandescent lamp, the girlstanding beside him.  Mr. Porter indicated a writing-shelf along theopposite wall, where Katie found a pile of the blanks, and pen andink.  While she struggled with the task assigned her, Mr. Porterverified, by brief, sharp inquiries through a telephone, herstatement of the approaching marriage of Miss Cora Costigan.Katie, meanwhile, was giving her age, her parentage, her birthplace,the name of the firm that had last employed her--she mentioned thecandy-shop for that,--was cheerfully agreeing to join the \"Employés\\'Mutual Benefit Association,\" and was putting a \"Yes,\" which sheintended promptly to forget, to the question that asked her to becomea spy on her co-workers: \"If you saw a fellow-employé doing anythingdetrimental to the interests of the firm, would you consider it yourduty to report the same?\"  It was only at one of the last questionsthat she hesitated.\"Please what does that mean?\" she asked.Mr. Porter deigned to walk across the room and, close to hershoulder, examined the question.  It was the simple one: \"Do you livewith your parents?\"\"That,\" said Mr. Porter, \"is inserted because the firm wishes to haveonly nice girls here, and those with good home influences areconsidered--most trustworthy.\"Mr. Porter had the type of emotionless eyes that can say one sort ofthing far better than the eyes of more temperamental people, and henow met Katie\\'s steady gaze with a stare of considerable significance.Katie was rather sure that she understood.\"So that,\" she said, \"if I didn\\'t live with my people, I couldn\\'thave the job?\"\"So that,\" Mr. Porter corrected, \"if a girl does get a position andlives with her family, she will be better cared for, and we will knowthat she is safe at home evenings.\"Katie hesitated no longer.  She took the pen and, opposite the query,wrote a quick \"Yes.\"  To be sure she was, on that account, obliged toinvent the kind of work done by her father and the amount of thefamily wage; but she so needed the position that her active wit atonce supplied the answers.  More or less truthfully, she put a wordin reply to the remaining questions, signed her name, and wrote heraddress.Mr. Porter took the paper in his white fingers, read it slowly,folded it, indorsed it with several hieroglyphics, and placed it in apigeon-hole.\"I am filing this with our other applications,\" he said.  \"As soon asyour name is reached, I will see that you are notified.\"Katie\\'s jaw dropped.\"But I thought,\" she began, \"I thought I was to get the job now.I--isn\\'t Cora leavin\\', thin, after all?\"\"Miss Costigan is leaving us, I understand,\" said Mr. Porter,stroking his whiskers; \"but there are others--nearly a hundred--onthe list ahead of you.\"Katie was hungry, and hunger finds it hard to think of justice.  Shehad borne all that she could bear.  The waiting, the walking, thehope and the hopelessness had gnawed the string of her courage.Something snapped inside of her, and she began to sob with Irishunrestraint.Mr. Porter was embarrassed.  He frequently had to deal harshly withother employés of his philanthropic employer--it was, in fact, uponthe performance of such duties that his living almost depended--buthe did not like to have tears shed in his office: it did not lookwell for the reputation of the establishment.\"My dear Miss--Miss Flanagan,\" said he, first consulting theapplication-blank for the forgotten name, and putting one of hiswhite hands toward the face now hidden in a crumpled handkerchief.\"You mustn\\'t--really, you must not!\"\"But everything depends on me gettin\\' this job!\" sobbed Katie in anIrish wail.  \"The rent\\'s due; me family\\'s all sick; the milkman won\\'tleave no more milk, an\\' I\\'ve eaten nothin\\' for Heaven knows how long!\"In a rush of words her story, including that of her resurrectedfather, leaped from her.  What effect it would have had upon Mr.Porter had it been calmly told is beyond guessing; but it was told byno means calmly, and Katie\\'s voice rose to a pitch that forced him tosurrender out of mere fear of a prolonged scene.  Grudgingly, butunconditionally, he laid down his arms.  He took the telephone andcalled again Miss Isaacs, the buyer of the women\\'s hosierydepartment, which Miss Costigan was to leave on the following day,told as much of Katie\\'s story as he thought necessary, and obtainedconsent to a trial of the girl.  He informed Katie that she mighttake, on the next morning, the place to be vacated by Miss Costigan,but he took care to impress upon her mind the fact that he was doingher an exceptional favor, which she was not to mention to herfriends, who might try to profit by her unusual experience.Katie was on the point of calling all the saints to bless him whenshe bethought her of a practical inquiry theretofore, in hereagerness to secure any sort of work, neglected.\"An\\' what\\'s the pay?\" she inquired.\"You will receive,\" replied Mr. Porter in the tones in which hisemployer announced the gift of a small fortune to a large college,\"four dollars and fifty cents a week.\"Katie forgot the saints.\"Four--\" she began.  \"But, Mr. Porter,\" she concluded, \"will you betellin\\' me how I\\'m to be livin\\' on all that?\"Mr. Porter\\'s calm eyes came again into significant play.\"You have said in your application, you may recall,\" he drylyremarked, as he reached for that document, \"you have said that youlived with your father.\"For a moment her glance probed his.\"But for all that,\" she said, \"I have to support meself entirely.\"Mr. Porter was still looking at her with his emotionless, appraisinggaze.  He saw a girl with pretty, piquant features, with glossy blackhair, with cheeks that bloomed even in privation and blue eyes thatwere beautiful even in tears.\"Miss Flanagan,\" said he, \"most of the girls that start at thesewages in department-stores are partly supported by their family orhave some friend to help them out.\"Katie flushed, but she kept her outward calm.\"An\\' what if they haven\\'t got a friend?\" she inquired.Porter\\'s cold eye never wavered.\"They find one,\" he said; \"and I may add, Miss Flanagan, that youshould experience no difficulty in that direction.\"Poverty will do much for most of us.  For Katie it succeeded incurbing a temper that, in better times, was never docile.  Beggars,she reflected, cannot afford to look too closely into the source orsignificance of the alms they have asked.  She swallowed her wrath.\"Will you advance one week\\'s salary now?\" she asked.Mr. Porter was distinctly surprised.\"I--why, certainly I won\\'t!\" he stammered.\"Why not?\"\"But, my dear Miss Flanagan, I have nothing to do with the payment ofthe salaries.  Besides, this firm doesn\\'t know you; it does not evenknow that you will come to-morrow; it does not know that, if you docome, you will remain.\"Katie smiled insidiously, and Katie smiling through her tear-curledlashes was insidious indeed.\"Och, now, Mr. Porter,\" she protested.  \"That\\'s all well enough forthe green girls; but you an\\' I know that you\\'re the boss in mattersof this sort.  Lend me two an\\' a quarter.\"Mr. Porter, pleased in spite of himself by her flattery, protested,but Katie remained unconvinced.  She declared that she knew he wasthe real authority and that she could not bear to hear himunderestimate himself.  And the upshot of the discussion was that,though Mr. Porter could, in his official capacity, do nothing sounbusinesslike as to make her an advance, he would, personally, beglad to oblige her with a dollar and a half, and oblige her, adding afatherly pat to her pink cheek, he ultimately did.\"Thanks,\" Katie responded as she took the money, and turned to go.\"I\\'ll report to-morrow, then, at a quarter of eight, Mr. Porter.\"\"At quarter to eight,\" repeated Mr. Porter, slowly closing the doorbehind her.But, out in the wet street, Katie was saying what she had refrainedfrom saying in the darkened office.\"An\\' as for the pay,\" she concluded, \"I can\\'t buy no automobiles withme loose change; but I think you\\'ll find, you limb of Satan, that Ican keep body an\\' soul together without a friend in the wor\\'rld!\"XANOTHER SPHEREThat same evening, his crisp brown mustache hiding the meaning of hismouth, and his drooping lids concealing the purpose of his steel-grayeyes, Wesley Dyker, from the rooms he had rented in an East SideAssembly district, took a cab northwestward through the rain toRiverside Drive.  He was dressed precisely as he dressed to go to thehouse of Rose Légère, but he was bound for the house of Joshua Lennox.There he had plainly been expected.  The liveried, tight-lippedservant, who opened the iron grill-work door for him, showed himdeferentially down a long tiled hall and into, not the formal whiteand gilt reception-room, but a comfortable, dimly-lighted apartment,a smoking-room, hung with fading mediæval tapestries, the floorcovered with deep rugs of the Orient, and the chairs wide,broad-armed, and upholstered in soft leather.\"Miss Lennox will be down in a moment, sir,\" said the servant.  \"MayI bring you anything, Mr. Dyker?\"Wesley shook his well-shaped head.\"No, thank you, Charles,\" he answered, and then, nodding to adecanter that, under a wide, soft-shaded lamp, stood upon a cornertable: \"Irish?\" he asked.Charles bowed, brought a tray, and, when Dyker had poured thewhiskey, added some seltzer, and lighted the cigarette that the guesthad taken from a wrought silver box on a nearby tabouret.\"That is all, Charles,\" said Dyker, and the servant silently left himalone.Wesley sank back in his chair with a sigh of comfort.  He liked thehouse of the philanthropic merchant so well that he could have wishedits master liked him better, and when, within a few minutes, themaster himself chanced into the room, Dyker was prepared to bediplomatic.Joshua N. Lennox was the explanation of that Mr. Porter who held somuch power under him.  The latter was tall and thin, the former shortand compact, but there all physical differences ended: Mr. Porter hadfound his model in his employer.  Here was the source of theseneschal\\'s gray hair and side-whiskers, his trap mouth tortured tothe line of benevolence, his calm gaze and his manner that combinedthe precision of the surgeon with the gravity of the head of aSunday-school.  Mr. Lennox, in fact, conducted the second largestBible Class in New York.  He knew its textbook from the first chapterof Genesis to the twenty-second chapter of the Revelation, and hebelieved in the literal inspiration of every verse of the originaland of every syllable of the English translation.It was in the voice in which he habitually addressed his Bible Class,the voice of one uttering a benediction, that he said:\"Good-evening, Mr. Dyker.\"Wesley put down his glass and rose to his feet.The man before him was the perfection of that noble work of Heaven, aProminent Citizen.  Joshua Lennox endowed Bowery chapels with organsand meat-supplies; he contributed heavily to missions among thebenighted Japanese; he assisted in arbitrating strikes wherein hisfellow-employers were concerned; he always served on memorialcommittees; and he regularly subscribed to the campaign funds of allmovements toward municipal political reform.If his climbing wife insisted upon having liquor in the house, Mr.Lennox never touched it.  If she served tobacco, he did not smoke.If she took in a Sunday paper, written and printed on Saturday, hewould read no news until the appearance of the Monday journal merelywritten and printed on Sunday.  And if his mercantile establishmentsold poker-chips under the pseudonym of \"counters,\" he was aware onlythat it did not sell playing-cards.  The business he considered ashis creation had grown beyond the limits of his power, and though, agood man and sincere, he might have done something by keeping acloser eye upon his work, he was in reality as much the creature ofconditions as his worst-paid cash-boy.  The great Frederickcomplained that a monarch could not know all the evil done in hiskingdom: Joshua Lennox was so busy benefiting mankind that he had noleisure to observe in his own shop the state of affairs that made hisphilanthropy financially possible.\"I hope you are going with us to the opera, Mr. Lennox,\" said Dyker.The old man shook his silvered head.\"No,\" said he in the slow, deliberate utterance that he had acquiredwith his first million of dollars; \"I am on my way farther down townthan that.\"\"But you had better come,\" urged Wesley, knowing that refusal wascertain.  \"This is the last performance of the season.\"\"On the contrary,\" the merchant chuckled kindly, \"I think you hadbetter let Marian go to the opera alone and come along with me.  I amgoing to the first performance of a new season.\"\"Where\\'s that?\"\"To the Municipal Improvement Mass Meeting at Cooper Union.\"That made it Dyker\\'s turn to smile.\"Oh, but I couldn\\'t do that,\" he said.  \"I\\'m on the other side, youknow.\"\"Against good government?\"  The elder man manifestly enjoyed thismild thrust.\"Against irregularity, Mr. Lennox.  There never has been and therenever can be any lasting reform from the outside.  We must clean ourown houses.  That is why I have moved to my present address.  Ibelieve in reform from within the party, and I believe that to effectthis we want men of your sort to help us indoors and not to attack usfrom the street.\"The merchant\\'s cold eye looked hard at the speaker, but Dyker\\'slowered lids betrayed nothing.\"Yes,\" replied Lennox, dryly; \"I heard that when Tammany Hall firstcame into power, but I have never seen any trace of reform from theinside.  What I have seen is the spectacle of most of these insidereformers developing into leaders of the machine.  If you will takean older man\\'s advice, you will withdraw while there is yet time.\"Wesley\\'s reply sprang ready to his lips, but, before he could utterit, Marian Lennox came into the room.Something of herself the girl received, no doubt, from her climbingmother; something, probably, from her satisfied father, and more thanshe guessed from a narrow environment.  Nevertheless, four years atcollege had cultivated in her what seemed to be a spirit ofindependence, and a brief life in the city had confirmed in her whatshe was certain were opinions of her own.She was tall and moved with assurance.  Her full throat rose abovethe ermine of her cloak, supporting a delicately carved head, thehead of a Greek cameo, held rigidly erect.  The hair was a richchestnut, the eyes large and brown, and the mouth at once firm andkindly.  Her skin was very fair and her gloved hands long and slender.She caught her father\\'s concluding words.\"While there is yet time,\" she paraphrased, \"Mr. Dyker will withdrawfrom this room and get me to the opera-house before the overture hasended.  I am so unfashionable as to want my music entire.\"She was used to commanding her parents in their own house, and shethought that she was used to commanding Wesley everywhere, so thatshe dismissed Lennox and secured Dyker\\'s entrance into her waitinglimousine with almost no delay whatever.\"There,\" she remarked as she settled herself comfortably for theirdrive; \"I rather fancy that I rescued you from a sermon.\"Dyker laughed shortly.\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" he said.  \"I esteem your father so much that Ishould like him to like me.\"\"But you think that he doesn\\'t like you?\"\"I think that he is slow to see that two persons may differ on aquestion of political tactics and yet remain, both of them, honestmen.\"\"And may they?\" bantered Marian.\"Well,\" he lightly accepted the challenge, \"I shall take the specificcase.  There is no doubting your father\\'s sincerity; there is nodoubting the sincerity of nearly all the men that will, with him,to-night try to launch another of these municipal-reform partieswhich, if they ever get started at all, are sure to run on the rocksat last.\"\"And on the other hand,\" said the girl, \"I suppose I must generouslyrefuse to doubt the sincerity of Tammany Hall?\"\"On the other hand you must justly refuse to doubt the sincerity of afew young men who have seen that reform-parties always end in violentreaction within the city and, if briefly successful, weaken the partyin the next national campaign.  You must refuse to doubt thesincerity of these young men when they go into the heart of the EastSide to live and work among the people that make up theorganization\\'s fighting-strength.  You must believe in them when theytry to get nominated for even the smallest offices on themachine-ticket.  And you must have faith that, if they can workthemselves at last into places of power, they will reform the partyin the only way that will keep it reformed.\"\"Dear me,\" sighed Marian, \"it seems that it was father that I rescuedfrom a sermon.\"\"Well,\" said Dyker, \"you asked me why your father and I should notmistrust each other, and there you have the reason.  You know what Iam trying to do; I have told you my plans as I haven\\'t told them toanother human being--and you should know that I am not to besuspected.\"There was a ring in his voice that touched her.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she said.  \"I beg you\\'ll forgive me.  Only really, youknow, you can\\'t expect father to be with you: he would have to breakthe habit of a lifetime.\"\"I don\\'t ask him to be with me; I only ask him to believe that a mancan work with the organization and yet have pure principles.\"\"He can\\'t even go so far as that; he says that every system is thereflection of the men that make it, and he says that the system yousupport battens on horrors.\"\"But it can\\'t be the system.  The horrors existed long before thesystem.  Is he such a conservative as not to be able to see that?\"\"He isn\\'t a conservative; he is the one unprogressive thing innature: the liberal of a preceding generation.  Only the other day Imentioned something I have been thinking about doing--something thatseveral of my most conventional friends have been doing for ever solong--and he was so dreadfully shocked that, though I\\'m now resolvedupon my course, I can\\'t guess how he\\'ll take it.\"Dyker\\'s curiosity was easily piqued.\"If you proposed it,\" he said, \"I can\\'t imagine that it was such avery terrible thing.\"\"Oh, no; it was merely that I want to be of some use in the world andso have made up my mind to go in for settlement-work.\"Wesley Dyker was one of those rare animals, a human being whoseparents, though they could have arranged it otherwise, permitted himto be born in New York.  He had been reared, at least during thewinters of his earlier life, within the Borough of Manhattan, and hisviews were, like those of most of his even less acclimated neighbors,just as wide as that narrow island, and no wider.  Indeed, so far aswere concerned his views of the proper sphere of his own womankind,he limited them entirely to an extremely small portion of the city.\"Of course you\\'re joking,\" he said.\"I am in cold earnest,\" she assured him.\"But that\\'s absurd.  You\\'ve--why you don\\'t know what settlement-workmeans!\"\"I know quite well what it means,\" said Marian.  \"I have friendsengaged in it, as I told you, and I\\'ve been visiting them and seeingtheir life at close quarters.\"\"And you really mean----\"\"I really mean that here we are at the Metropolitan, and that wecan\\'t talk on our way upstairs, and we won\\'t talk while there ismusic to listen to.\"Slowly their car had taken its grudged place in a long procession ofits fellows, one by one unloading the human freight before thebrilliantly lighted doorway.  The pavement and the steps were atossing sea of silk hats, colored scarfs, and glittering headdresses.Into this they plunged, hurried to the crowded elevator, traversed alighted corridor, passed through a short, dark passage and came outto the Lennox box in the great, glaring horseshoe of the opera-house.Dyker, baffled by the sudden stop that had been put to his protests,looked moodily upon the familiar picture.  Below them, climbing tothe rail behind which was massed the orchestra, was the pit, whitebosoms and bare shoulders, too distant to present, to the unassistedeye, any hint of individuality.  Above rose the teeming galleries,line above line of peering faces.  And to right and left swept thegreat curve of the boxes splendid with lace and feathers and jewels.He saw no more than that during the entire performance and, asMarian, even in the _entr\\'actes_, would talk of nothing but the musicto which he had refused to listen, he heard less.  The opera was\"Lucia,\" and as Wesley, with a taste worthy of a more discerningcritic, considered that work nothing but a display of vocalgymnastics devised for a throat abnormally developed, he wouldprobably have been, in any case, bored.His father, who had what his friends called \"family,\" had marriedwhat everybody called \"money,\" but had managed to invest thatcommodity with a talent for choosing failures, and, when both parentshad died, Wesley, fresh from the Columbia Law School, had amazedlyfound himself in a position where he would actually have to turn hiseducation to practical account.  For five years he held a thankless,underpaid and unmentioned partnership in a well-known firm ofcorporation-lawyers.  He drew their briefs, and developed a genuinetalent for the task, but he was never given a chance to plead.  Theworm of necessity spun its cocoon in his brain, but the emergingbutterfly of ambition could find no way to liberty.One day, however, he was commissioned to prepare the case in defenseof a large contractor, quite justly accused of fraud.  It happenedthat, when the young lawyer brought the results of his week\\'s work tohis chief, the client in whose interests the work had been done wascloseted with the head of the firm, and, Dyker being presented, thatcontractor learned of Wesley\\'s service.  At the ensuing trial theclient was acquitted, and remembered the service.  He lived on theEast Side and made most of his money from political jobs.  The restfollowed simply enough.  Dyker was introduced to the powers of hispatron\\'s district, and, thinking that he saw here the opportunity ofwhich he had begun to despair, he had left his former employers andwas already shouldering his way forward among his new friends.  Hisformer acquaintances mildly wondered what the devil he was after; hislatter ones began to regard him as a clever fellow, and thenewspapers printed stories of him as a young society man thatgratuitously gave his legal talents to the help of the poor.For his own part, Dyker was quite certain of what he was and of whathe would be.  He had seen, beneath his lowered lids, that a cleverman could gain both fortune and power through political prestige, andhe meant to use that means to his end.  He had also, while still withthe firm of corporation-lawyers, been presented to Marian Lennox byher opportunely-met, socially-aspiring mother, and was, whatever hisrelation with other members of her sex, quite as much in love withher as he could be with anybody.  Realizing the power of her father\\'sfortune and the beauty of the girl herself, he had determined tomarry her with as little delay as possible.Until to-night he had delayed all open pursuit, because there had notbeen lacking signs to free him from fear of all male rivals; but thatMarian should thus suddenly develop a purpose in life meant that hewas to have a rival of a far more formidable sort.  He set his teethunder his crisp mustache, folded his arms across his heart, and satstolidly through the interminable opera: as soon as it was over, hemeant to play his first lead.He did play it--played it as soon as their car had crept up in answerto its electric-call and whisked them away into the night.  As theyshot up the flaming street, her clean-cut profile was almost asdistinct as it had been in the box, and the girl, still thrillingwith the memory of the music she so passionately loved, was close tothe mood best suited to his own.\"May I talk now?\" he asked ruefully.She smiled.\"You mean to ask if you may argue,\" she answered.  \"No, you may notargue against my determination, and I am a good deal surprised that aman of your sort should want to.\"\"I don\\'t intend to argue,\" he protested, leaning the merest trifletoward her.  \"I mean only to ask you if your determination is quitefixed.\"She bowed her splendid head.\"Quite fixed,\" she said.\"So that argument would not shake it?\"\"So that no argument could shake it.\"\"Nor any persuasion?\"His voice had sunk only a semi-tone, but her feminine ear noted thechange.\"Nor any persuasion,\" she replied.\"Then suppose I presented to you neither argument nor persuasion, buta condition?\"\"But there is no conceivable condition that could arise to change me.You refuse to understand that I see this thing as a duty.\"A lamp stronger than its fellows threw a quick ray full upon herface; her brown eyes were charmingly serious, her lips dangerouslysweet.\"What I understand,\" responded Dyker, \"is that there is one situationin which a woman may find herself where there arises a duty thatcrowds all others from the board.\"His hand, in the semi-darkness, sought and found her own, its glovewithdrawn, cool and firm and unretreating.\"You know the situation I mean,\" he said.  \"I love you.  I love youso much, Marian, that I am jealous of any work that would take youfrom me; I want so much of your love that I can spare none ofit--none even for the poor and suffering.\"In that tight grasp her hand fluttered a little, but she did notanswer: she could not answer, because, while her brain was tellingher that a love so rapacious was necessarily niggardly, her heart wascrying out that this was the love it wanted most of all.\"Marian\"--his voice shook now with the emotion that was tugging atits leash--\"you\\'ve known for some months that I loved you; all lastwinter you must have seen this coming; you can\\'t be unprepared toanswer me!\"He possessed himself of her other hand, and pressed her inert palmsbetween his own.But the girl\\'s determination loomed large to her.  Through her entirelife she had been shut away from the real world, behind rich curtainsand amid soft lights, until, fired with the unrest of a partialeducation, she had chanced upon a glimpse of classmates working inwhat they called the slums, and now, with all the enthusiasm ofyouth, she had resolved to join them.  A maturer woman would not havetaken so seriously a sudden impulse to engage in work for which shehad no training, but Marian was young.\"I am not unprepared,\" she answered.  \"I did know.  But I know toothat there are things that can make even love a finer, a betteremotion.\"The words reminded her of some speech she had once heard in a play,and, entirely in earnest as she was, the sound of them from her ownlips strengthened her.  She was in love with Wesley Dyker, but shewas more in love with renunciation.The man, however, shook his head.\"No,\" he said, \"love is something ultimate.  You can\\'t paint thelily; you can\\'t part it and share it; you must either cherish it orkill it.  Which do you mean to do?\"The car had turned into the smoother way of Riverside Drive, wherethe lights are far fewer and less bright than Broadway\\'s.  He couldnot see her face, but he could not doubt the resolve that was in hervoice as she answered:\"I mean to take up the work that I have told you of.\"\"But that\\'s folly, Marian!\"He had chosen the wrong term of description, and, the moment heuttered it, he knew that he had erred.  \"Folly\" is the word thatyouth most resents.Marian withdrew her hands.\"It is strange,\" she said, \"to hear you, of all men, laugh at anattempt to help the poor.\"\"I am not laughing; I\\'m too serious to laugh.  I am so serious that Ican\\'t pick and choose phrases.  I meant only that you can\\'t helpthese people without training----\"\"I can get training.\"\"Without knowing them?\"\"The only way to know them is to go to them.\"\"But even then, you can do so little.  These settlements accomplishpractically nothing.  They are fads for the people that run them andplaythings for the people they are intended to help.  I can speakwith authority, and I tell you that the young men and women, the boysand girls, that go to them, drop in only when they have nothing elseto do, and all the rest of the time go their own ways.\"He forgot that he had said he would not argue.  He used all his powerto convince and to persuade; but if there is one human being thatcannot be moved from a purpose, it is a young girl with a romanticideal, smarting under what she conceives to be ridicule, and for thefirst time tasting what she believes to be the bitter-sweets ofsacrifice.  Even when the verbal war had been carried into her ownhouse, he could bring no concession from her.  If he was helping hisneighbors, then he should be all the more anxious that she, as thewoman he wanted to be his wife, should have precisely the experiencethat the settlement would supply her.\"Then you mean,\" he asked, \"that you do care--that you care at leasta little?\"He put out his hands, but she did not seem to see them.\"I mean,\" she answered, \"that we must wait.\"XIUNDER THE LASHIt was on the day following her eavesdropping upon Rose that Violetwas awakened early--as early as eleven o\\'clock in the morning--by asudden cry.  The sound was one of some pain and more terror,beginning in the high note of horrified amazement and ending in anattenuating moan of despair.Violet had been living in a highly charged atmosphere: she sat up inbed, sleep immediately banished from her brain.  She remained stilland listened.  She heard Rose\\'s now familiar footstep.  She heard adoor open and close.  She heard that cry frightfully begin again, andthen she heard it more frightfully stop in mid-power, cease in abruptand hideous silence.There came a discreet tapping at her own door.\"Are you alone, my dear?\"It was the deep, contralto voice of English Evelyn, and, as Violetreplied in the affirmative, the woman softly entered.Her tall, almost thin, figure was draped in a soiled pink kimona; heryellow hair seemed merely to have been tossed upon her head and tohave been left precisely as it happened to alight; her blue eyes weredull, and her hard, narrow face, with its spots of high color overthe cheek-bones, showed more plainly than common, the usually faintlittle red veins that lay close below its white skin.\"My Gawd,\" she sighed, as she sank upon the bed and curled up at itsfoot, \"there are some things I can\\'t get accustomed to, andthat\"--she nodded in the direction whence the cry had come--\"that\\'sone of them.\"She spoke in a weary voice, a voice with almost no animation, butwith a curious mixture of the cockney of the New Yorker and with arising inflection that saved what she said from monotony.\"What was it?\" asked Violet.\"You ought to know.  It was another of them.\"\"You mean----\"  The question trailed into nothingness on Violet\\'swhitening lips.\"Yes,\" said Evelyn, seizing a pillow and snuggling her broadshoulders against it.  \"Got a cig?\"  And then, as her hostessproduced a box from under the mattress: \"It does so get upon mynerves.  Why, sometimes they come here young enough to play withdollies.  This time there was no more sleep for boiby.  Had to rundownstairs and rig a B. and S., and then come up to girlie here forcompany.\"\"How--how did this happen?\"\"How the deuce do you suppose?  One story is pretty much all of them,my dear, and one about as narsty as the others.\"\"But this?\"\"Oh, this broke me up just because I had the bad luck to hear thedetails, though I must say I\\'ve heard the same details often enoughbefore.  Her people lived in a tenement in Essex Street, where it\\'sso crowded that the men have to come outside every evening whiletheir wives cook the dinners--three nine-by-seven rooms, no barth andno privacy; four children from eighteen to ten in one room; pa, ma,the boiby, and the seven-year-old in the second, and the cot in thekitchen-living-room rented to the lodger.  The lodger was the wigglysnake under the apple-tree.\"\"He brought her here?\"\"Gave her, as you might say, the general directions.  But she\\'d havecome along of her own self sometime.\"\"How could she?\"\"How couldn\\'t she, you mean!  Those tenements are not for livingin--there isn\\'t room for that--they\\'re just to eat in, when you\\'vegot enough, and sleep in, when you can sleep, and die in, when youhave to.\"\"So this girl had to live outside?\"\"On the doorsteps and the roofs when it was hot, and walking up anddown the street when it wasn\\'t.\"Violet remembered her own home, and reflected that her excuse wasless, because her surroundings had been better.\"That must have been pretty bad,\" she said.\"It was bad, but it wasn\\'t so bad as being indoors, my dear.  That\\'swhat most girls think about it anyway, and that\\'s why they never gohome before ten or eleven.  How else do the moving-picture shows keeprunning and how else do the dance-halls make their cakes and ale?\"\"The dance-halls?\"  The word was new to Violet.\"Yes, my dear, I said the dance-halls--where you pay five cents todance in the dust, with the windows nailed fast to start a thirst,and then buy you bad beer of the kind proprietor.  That\\'s where thelodger took this girl, and that\\'s where she learned to drink.\"\"Too much?\"\"Chuck it, dearie, chuck it.  Among all the wasters I\\'ve known, I\\'venever found one drunkard: they all called themselves moderatedrinkers.  Well, this girlie played double for a bit, and then met anice young man that wanted to marry her next day.  She woke up here.\"\"Did they drug her?\"\"Did they drug you?  They don\\'t have to drug you: you know that.  Theminute a girl tells me she was drugged, I say to myself: \\'You\\'re thekind that walk in and won\\'t take \"No\" for an answer.\\'  No, you catchflies with syrup; you don\\'t shoot them with machine-guns.  Narstybusiness, no?\"Violet was hearing for the first time how life made the net in whichit had taken her.  She passed her hand across her burning eyes.\"You seem to have seen a lot,\" she said.\"Haven\\'t I just?  I had my own little flat--to myself, too--once upona time, and I kept my eyes about me.  There was the Dago woman thatowned a fruit-stand on my corner.  She lived in an alley off HoustonStreet, and had a sixteen-year-old daughter who worked twelve hours aday rolling cigarettes.--Chuck me another, there\\'s a good girlie.Thanks, awfully.--That girl hated her work--can you blame her?--met aman that told her she wouldn\\'t have to work any more, and good-by.\"\"She went with him?\"\"Parsed out of sight completely, my dear.  Mother nearly crazy.  Wentto the police.  Police added the girlie\\'s name to their three columnsof other missing girls for that year, and said they couldn\\'t guesswhere she was.  An uncle tried to go on an inspection-tour of hisown, and had spent about all the family cash when he got to a flat onWest Fortieth Street and had its girls in for the usual drinks.  Hesaw his niece, but the bouncer knocked him down, and when he woke upin the arey, the happy family had moved.\"\"And that was all?\"\"That was all till, some two years later, the girl sent for hermother to come to Bellevue to see her die.  As soon as she was usedup, they\\'d turned her out without one of the pennies she had earnedfor them.--Narsty, eh?\"There was a brief pause.\"I guess,\" said Violet, \"there ain\\'t much chance for you unlessyou\\'re good.\"\"My dear,\" answered the Englishwoman, \"if you\\'re good, you haven\\'t achance at all.  It\\'s just a question of whether you have or haven\\'tenough to live on.  The best guardian of a man\\'s virtue is the worstenemy of a woman\\'s--and that\\'s an empty pocketbook, my dear.\"But Violet was in no mind for generalizations.\"It\\'s a business, then, ain\\'t it?\" she asked.\"A regular business,\" nodded Evelyn,--\"fifty cents up--and now thatthey\\'ve smashed the lotteries, policy, and the races, it\\'s more of abusiness than ever.  There are hundreds of young chaps all over thecountry who make their living by selling girls to places likethis--and worse than this; and there are more who make better livingsby making one, or two, or even three girls walk the street for them.Just now, in New York, the street\\'s the main thing.\"\"An\\' people like Miss Rose----?\"\"They buy the girls and pay a percentage on their work, my dear, tillthe debt\\'s cleared.  Sometimes they give their girls nothing butbrass checks for every job, but whether we get brass checks or realcash, it\\'s all the same: board and lodging and clothes are so highthat we never get out of debt to the madam.  Trust her for that!\"She had a thorough knowledge of her subject, and she ran on as if heronly interest in it were economic.  She talked of Denver, with itstwo-room houses in which the front seemed one large window where thesole inmate displayed her wares; of Chicago with the curtained doorsthrough which was thrust only a hand to receive the varying price ofadmission, even a quarter of a dollar occasionally sufficing; of thesame city\\'s infamous club maintained by politicians for their owndebauches.  She told of the proprietresses making a specialty of\"sending out\" for girls that worked at other and ill-paid tasks byday; of women conducting flats on a partnership basis; of those whorented, for high prices, houses that would otherwise be tenantlessbecause of poor conditions or the opening of some street that mustsoon be cut through the premises.  She said that young girls unsoiledwould sometimes fetch their owners fifty dollars for their initialdestruction, but that, as a rule, the sums were relatively small.\"And Miss Rose has to pay the police,\" asked Violet; \"don\\'t she?\"\"She does just, little innocent.  And the police have to pay theofficers above them, and the officers above them have to pay theward-bosses above _them_--and there you are.  It\\'s all the worsesince the bosses can\\'t make any money from gambling-houses, and it\\'sall the worse since the business got organized and meant votes forthe gang at every election.--Oh,\" Evelyn broke off--\"I tell you it\\'sthe same in every city the world over, my dear, and you and I haven\\'teven the comfort of being exceptions.\"\"Don\\'t people know about it?\"\"People don\\'t want to know about it.  People don\\'t want to feelbadly.  People say that it isn\\'t true, and that, if it is true, itisn\\'t fit to mention.\"\"Did you ever go to a dance-hall?\"Forgetting her recent attitude of democracy, Evelyn raised herpointed chin.\"I should say not,\" she answered.  \"Only a year ago I had thatapartment of my very own.  An Africander took me out of the chorus atthe \\'Gaiety\\' over home,--and a good job, too--and, when he died and Icame here, one of the best doctors in this town took care of me.  Hesaid he was going to marry me,\" she ended with a short laugh, \"butwhen his old wife died, he forgot that, and forgot me, and married asociety girl young enough to be his grandchild.  Of course he diedhimself after a few months, but that didn\\'t help me, my dear: I hadto strike out, and now, from the best places I\\'ve come down as far asthis.\"Violet was still too young to feel keenly for another while herselfin suffering, a fact that must have presented itself to Evelyn,because she turned from her own story with an easy shrug.\"After all,\" she pursued, \"the thing\\'s at least better run now thatit has become a men\\'s business.  There are no jobs left at the topexcept the running of the houses: the men get the girls, the rents,and most of the profits.\"\"Fritzie said they got lots of immigrants.\"\"Well, rather.  Most of the Dago ditch-diggers go home every winter,and any one of them will bring a girl back with him as his wife ifyou\\'ll pay him a little over the price of the passage money.  That\\'sone way, but there are a jolly lot more, not to mention themake-believe employment agencies that catch the girls by regiments.The women are packed over here in the steerage like cattle, my dear,and ticketed like low-class freight.  All they own goes into a smallhandbag and once they get here, they\\'re herded ten in a room till theagency-runners call for them.  Around Houston Street you can seestreets full of those nifty little agencies: they ship the girls allover the States.\"\"I never thought such things could happen.\"\"Of course you didn\\'t.  Nobody does, my dear--and that\\'s one reasonthey do happen.  Not that the immigrants are unduly favored.  Allover the East Side you can see families of the Chosen People goinginto real mourning for cadet-caught girlies, just as if the poorthings were really dead.  The other races suffer quite as much, too,though the Yankees are less likely to get into the cheaper joints.\"\"That\\'s where they give them the brass checks?\" asked Violet.\"Yes.  The man buys the checks downstairs, on a commutation schedule,just the w\\'y we used to buy our drink checks in a beer garden.  Thegirls never see real money--except when they make a touch, and thenit\\'s not any use--because they cash in their checks to the madam, andshe counts them against what her young l\\'idies owe her.  Even atthat\"--Evelyn nearly sat upright in her animation--\"even at that,they do s\\'y the men try to jew you down as badly as they do here.I\\'ve always noticed that the honestest man that ever lived will tryto cheat a girl.  But you\\'ll learn it all in time, girlie.  I\\'m onlysorry that you\\'ll never see the better plices.\"Violet missed the innuendo, but she asked:\"Then there are better and worse?\"Evelyn laughed.\"Right-oh!\" she said.  \"The horrid truth is, my dear, that we andRose are hopelessly middle-class.  I wish you could see the better,and as for the worse, wait till you live in a plice where there aresliding panels in the wall, and men are robbed every night.\"If there had been any sympathy in the Englishwoman\\'s tone, Violetmight have appealed to her for whatever of real assistance she couldgive, but Evelyn\\'s scarcely interrupted monologue soon made it clearthat she had no help to offer.\"It\\'s all rotten,\" she continued,--\"all rotten because it has to be.Do you fancy that, if Rose wasn\\'t sure of us, she wouldn\\'t have herear at that keyhole now?  She can call in Angel half the time, andone cop or another\\'s never far around the corner.  Three weeks agoPhil Beekman, one of her best customers, tried to balance a lamp onhis nose and broke it, and Riley was there to arrest him fordisorderly conduct before the boy could get to his wallet.  He had topay twenty-five dollars--half went to Riley--for that fifteen-dollarlamp that Rose had insured for eighteen.  We\\'re all that w\\'y; we allhave to be spies on the rest.  I am, you soon will be, and thatlittle Wanda--well, of course, Rose makes too much fuss over her.\"\"What do you mean?\" asked Violet.But Evelyn only shook her towsled yellow head.\"I mean, my dear,\" she said, \"that there are some things, you know,that even I don\\'t fancy discussing.\"\"She was an immigrant, wasn\\'t she?\"\"Oh, yes,\" Evelyn acquiesced, with a yawn.  Already her restlessheart was tiring of the conversation and her insistent thirst wascrying for more alcohol.  \"Wanda came over here to be a housemaid.She landed in Philadelphia and went directly to an employment agency,like a good girlie.  They took her money for their commission ingetting her a job, and then they sold her right over here to asailors\\' joint.\"\"For housework?\"\"Housework?  My dear, you overact your part.  There\\'s no houseworkdone in those plices; but Wanda\\'s won her w\\'y up in the world.  Hereshe is at Rose\\'s, if you please, though by what sort of housework Ishan\\'t tell you.\"\"I wish----\"\"Not another word, my dear.  Talking is a dry game.  After all,drinking is the king of indoor sports.  Come on down and rig a bit offizz.\"But Violet did not join in this predatory expedition.  She forgot theplight of the new captive whose cries she had heard; she forgot eventhe details of Evelyn\\'s just-related case; she remembered only somuch of the general situation, now made clear to her, as bore uponher own position, and she came at last to a pitch of crafty couragethat was far more promising of success than any of the hystericaldeterminations that she had previously experienced.  Open revolt wasfutile; she would employ methods more circuitous, and would usewhatever weapons were at hand.It was, as Evelyn had said, a house of spies and eavesdroppers, and,at the next opportunity--which occurred that night--Violet soughtagain her secret place of vantage on the back stairs, and listenedagain to her jailer in conversation with the Italian.  Her time, asit chanced, was brief, but she heard enough to know that Wesley Dykerwas the subject of the conference, and that betrayal of some sort wasits intent.\"Nothin\\' much,\" Rose was saying, in apparent answer to some questionasked before the spy had taken up her breathless post in the darkenedstairway.  \"I\\'ll get more out of him later on.\"\"Yas,\" replied Angel, \"but how mooch?\"\"He said he thought he\\'d pull it off, all right, but wasn\\'t sure ofO\\'Malley.  Said he\\'d got a bunch of kind words from up top, but wasscared for fear O\\'Malley would knife him.  He\\'s a pretty wise guy forall he\\'s a swell, and he\\'s lookin\\' out for the double-cross from yourcrowd.\"\"He ast you to helpa keepa lookout?\"\"Sure he did.  Said if O\\'Malley\\'s man put up a bluff at runnin\\'independent, I was to tip him off when O\\'Malley began registeringvotes here.\"\"That isa good.  More?\"\"Some.  Said he wanted me to keep my ears wide for any news.  Wantedme to pump you.\"\"He deed?\"  The voice grew threatening.  \"Say, now, you tella me whyhe knaw you knawa me?\"\"I guess he has as good ears as most people.\"\"But how he knawa me an\\' you----\"\"He don\\'t know that, Angel.  Keep your hair on.  He don\\'t knownothin\\' about it.  If he did, do you think he\\'d stand for it, an\\'cough up all these here straight tips to me?\"\"Na-aw,\" the Italian drawlingly admitted, in slow mollification.\"Naw, maybe he woulda not.\"\"He certainly wouldn\\'t.  He don\\'t know nothin\\' about it.  What he\\'safraid of is that somebody might think _he_ stood in too good here.\"\"He say that?\"\"Yep.\"\"Alla right.  Now, you tella him when he comes again, O\\'Malleymeans----\"The voice dropped to so low a whisper that Violet could hear no more,and, before it was raised, the doorbell had sounded and she had heardCeleste, upstairs, calling her.  She tiptoed back to the upperhallway.\"Cassie say you\\' New York Central frien\\' ees askin\\' for you,\"volunteered the French girl as they met.\"All right,\" answered Violet.  \"I\\'ll be right down.  I was trying toswipe a bottle.  And say, Celeste, how does that Wesley Dyker come tohave such a pull with Miss Rose?\"\"Oh-h!  You don\\' know?  That Wes\\' Dyk\\' \\'e mabby be a magistrate nex\\'\\'lection.  \\'E\\'s one gran\\' man now for bail an\\' lawyer when troublecome.--\\'Es\\'s frien\\'s with so many politicians, too.  But Meess Rose,she know \\'e will be some more eef \\'e be \\'lected magistrate.\"\"Oh, I see.  But doesn\\'t she keep standing in, on the quiet, with theother people who want the place, too?\"Celeste nodded a cheerful agreement.\"But of a certainty,\" she said.  \"Meess Rose, she know \\'er beezness.Whoever get that \\'lection, Meess Rose, she will \\'ave been \\'eesfrien\\'.\"Violet asked no more.  She had learned enough to put into her handsthe best weapon just then available.XIION STRIKEKatie Flanagan arrived at the Lennox department-store every morningat a quarter to eight o\\'clock.  She passed through the employés\\' darkentrance, a unit in a horde of other workers, and registered theinstant of her arrival on a time-machine that could in no wise besuborned to perjury.  She hung up her wraps in a subterraneancloak-room, and, hurrying to the counter to which she was assigned,first helped in \"laying out the stock,\" and then stood behind herwares, exhibiting, cajoling, selling, until an hour before noon.  Atthat time she was permitted to run away for exactly forty-fiveminutes for the glass of milk and two pieces of bread and jam thatcomposed her luncheon.  This repast disposed of, she returned to thecounter and remained behind it, standing like a war-worn watcher onthe ramparts of a beleaguered city, till the store closed at six,when there remained to her at least fifteen minutes more of workbefore her sales-book was balanced and the wares covered up for thenight.  There were times indeed when she did not leave the storeuntil seven o\\'clock, but those times were caused rather by customersthan by the management of the store, which could prevent new shoppersfrom entering the doors after six, but could hardly turn out thosealready inside.The automatic time-machine and a score of more annoying, and equallyautomatic, human beings, kept watch upon all that she did.  Theformer, in addition to the floor-walker in her section of the store,recorded her every going and coming, the latter reported everymovement not prescribed by the regulations of the establishment; andthe result upon Katie and her fellow-workers was much the resultobservable upon condemned assassins under the unwinking surveillanceof the Death Watch.If Katie was late, she was fined ten cents for each offense.  She wasreprimanded if her portion of the counter was disordered after amauling by careless customers.  She was fined for all mistakes shemade in the matter of prices and the additions on her sales-book; andshe was fined if, having asked the floor-walker for three or fiveminutes to leave the floor in order to tidy her hair and hands, inconstant need of attention through the rapidity of her work and thehandling of her dyed wares, she exceeded her time limit by so much asa few seconds.There were no seats behind the counters, and Katie, whatever herphysical condition, remained on her feet all day long unless shecould arrange for relief by a fellow-worker during that worker\\'sluncheon time.  There was no place for rest save a damp, ill-lighted\"Recreation Room\" in the basement, furnished with a piano that nobodyhad time to play, magazines that nobody had time to read, and wickerchairs in which nobody had time to sit.  All that one might do was toserve the whims and accept the scoldings of women customers who knewtoo ill, or too well, what they wanted to buy; keep a tight rein uponone\\'s indignation at strolling men who did not intend to buy anythingthat the shop advertised; be servilely smiling under the innuendoesof the high-collared floor-walkers, in order to escape their wrath;maintain a sharp outlook for the \"spotters,\" or paid spies of theestablishment; thwart, if possible, those pretending purchasers whowere scouts sent from other stores, and watch for shop-lifters on theone hand and the firm\\'s detectives on the other.\"It ain\\'t a cinch, by no means\"--thus ran the departing CoraCostigan\\'s advice to her successor--\"but it ain\\'t nothin\\' now to whatit will be in the holidays.  I\\'d rather be dead than work in thetoy-department in December--I wonder if the kids guess how we thatsells \\'em hates the sight of their playthings--and I\\'d rather be dead_an\\'_ damned than work in the accounting-department.  A girl friendof mine worked there last year,--only it was over to Malcare\\'sstore--an\\' didn\\'t get through her Christmas Eve work till two onChristmas morning, an\\' she lived over on Staten Island.  Sheoverslept on the twenty-sixth, an\\' they docked her a half-week\\'s pay.\"An\\' don\\'t never,\" concluded Cora, \"don\\'t never let \\'em transfer youto the exchange department.  The people that exchange things allbelong in the psychopathic ward at Bellevue--them that don\\'t belongin Sing Sing.  Half the goods they bring back have been used fordays, an\\' when the store ties a tag on a sent-on-approval operacloak, the women wriggle the tag inside, an\\' wear it to the theaterwith a scarf draped over the string.  Thank God, I\\'m goin\\' to bemarried!\"In these conditions Katie found many imperative duties, but nonequite so immediately imperative as the repression of Mr. Porter.  Shehad not made her first sale at the main women\\'s hosiery counter onthe first floor, to which she had been assigned on herarrival--pretty girls always being favored with first-floorpositions--when that tall, gray-whiskered gentleman, his duties inhis underground office not at this hour holding him, majesticallyapproached her.\"Good-morning, Miss Flanagan,\" he said, with a beneficent smile, ashe placed his white hand upon her quailing shoulder.Katie became very busy with the stock that was new to her.\"Good-morning, Mr. Porter,\" she answered.--\"Say, Miss Isaacs, howmuch do these lisle ones sell at?\"\"I thought,\" said Mr. Porter, fixing her with his apparentlyemotionless gaze, \"that I would just come over and see if you werewell taken care of.\"\"None better, Mr. Porter.\"  Katie smiled sweetly as she said it, andstill more sweetly as she significantly added: \"Them\\'s always takengood care of as are used to takin\\' good care of themselves.\"Mr. Porter blinked, but his expression, or lack of expression, didnot alter.\"No doubt,\" he responded, as he reluctantly made ready to go away;\"but I shall be glad to be of help at any time I can.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\"And I shall drop around now and then to see that all goes well.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\"Because I was always interested in Miss Costigan--very muchinterested, and she was very pleasant to me--and I am naturally verymuch interested in her successor, too.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Porter.\"\"And, by the way, Miss Flanagan,\" he added as his Parthian shaft, \"Itrust you won\\'t worry over that little loan, you know; there\\'s nohurry in the world about repayment.\"Katie met his vacant glance with the innocent eyes of a gratefulchild.\"That\\'s kind you are, Mr. Porter,\" she answered, \"and since you sayit, I shan\\'t worry, sir.\"But for all that, she did not by any means dismiss the man from herthoughts.  Her true schooling had been received from the textbook oflife, and she had readily observed in Porter\\'s demeanor the tokensthat announced the beginning of a chase.  To one class of huntersthere is no closed season, and Katie knew that this class consideredher and her kind fair game.There had been occasions when she had debated seriously, sometimeswith herself and sometimes with a companion, whether it was worthwhile to continue the flight, whether from three to six years ofcaptivity, of toil that must end in death, but that was at leastassured of food, were not to be preferred to the continuance of aprecarious dodging through the industrial forest with the possibilityof starvation lurking behind every bush.  But this question she hadalways, thus far, answered in the negative, at first because of herinherent disinclination to confess defeat in any struggle thatengaged her, and at last because of Hermann Hoffmann.To Katie\\'s cheerful cynicism that blind optimist was an object ofunfailing tenderness.  She knew how he had been left, when hisfather\\'s heart was broken after a long battle against an oppressivelandlord system, with a gentle mother whom he worshiped and who thusbecame entirely dependent upon him; how he had sold the few remainingfamily belongings, escaped the threat of a compulsory militaryservice that would have left Frau Hoffmann in destitution, and come,lured by the glittering promises of one of the immigration agents ofa steamship company, to the land where he had been told there existedequality of opportunity for all men.  And he had told Katie, in hisconvincingly simple English, how, a shred at a time, the fabric ofhis ideal had been torn away; how bitterly he had toiled only to keephis foothold; how the little mother had fallen beneath the stress,and yet how, to the last, he still retained his high hope, and stilldreamed of a genuine democracy in a country where the men that workedwould eventually become the owners of the wealth that their handscreated.She was thinking of this when, that night, she returned to hertenement and found waiting at her door her neighbor Carrie Berkowicz,the shirt-waist worker, who had told her of the chance of a positionat the Lennox shop.\"Hello,\" said Katie.  \"Lookin\\' for me?\"\"Yes.\"\"Come on in.\"Katie led the way and lit the lamp, which threw a kindly light overthe neat, bare room, with its stiff wooden chairs, itsoilcloth-covered table, and the lithograph of Our Lady of the Rosarytacked against the room door.  A gas-stove, a cot, a bureau, and ascreened-off sink completed the furnishings.\"I\\'m just gettin\\' a bite of supper,\" she said, before she asked thecause of Carrie\\'s visit.  \"You\\'d better have some.\"\"No, thank you,\" replied the caller, with her careful night-schoolinflection.  \"I had mine early.\"Katie looked at the speaker, whose round cheeks seemed drawn in a newdetermination, and whose jaw was swollen as if from a blow.\"How did you get through so early, Carrie?\" she inquired.The little Lithuanian\\'s eyes sparkled.\"We\\'ve done it,\" she said.\"Done what?\"\"Gone out.\"\"Struck?\"Carrie nodded.\"You know how it was,\" she explained; \"all the girls around here do.We\\'ve had to work all day long from early morning till late night,Sundays too, and five dollars for the seven days is counted prettygood wages.\"\"But somebody said the firms\\' books showed your pay was higher.\"\"Oh, the books did show it.  You see, they carry only a few of us ontheir salary list, and then each of the foremen hires helpers paidout of one girl\\'s wages.  You know as well as I do that most of uslive on oatmeal and crackers, and rent one bed in somebody else\\'stenement.\"Katie was acquainted with enough of the shirt-waist makers to beaware that this was true.\"That\\'s so,\" she granted; \"only I thought them things were all endedafter the last row.\"\"Well, they weren\\'t ended; they were only helped for a few months,and now it\\'s summer and most of us would have been laid off.  It\\'sthe worst time to strike--we know that--but things came to a pointwhere we had to make a fight, or there wouldn\\'t have been any of usleft to fight when a better time did come.\"\"You\\'re talkin\\' about the union?\"\"Yes, that\\'s the real point.  The bosses started a union of theirown.\"\"Among themselves?\"\"No--they\\'ve always had that.  I mean they got the new girls intowhat they called a beneficial association, with the bosses forofficers.  If you join that, you get all sorts of favors, but youcan\\'t join unless you leave the old union.\"\"Well?\"\"Well, then, as soon as they get the beneficial association fullenough, they discharge the union girls and, little by little,withdraw the privileges from the Association members, so that thingsgo back to where they were before.\"The girl spoke quietly, but Katie remembered many of the evils thatCarrie had not mentioned.  She recalled how each moment\\'s pause inwork meant a deduction from the worker\\'s pay; how the elaboratesystem of fines taxed the girl whose fingers left her task torearrange a straying lock of hair, and how the tears forced byoverstrained nerves or over-exerted muscles cost the offender almosta fixed price apiece; how the girls that did piecework received nomoney unless they brought the little check for every article made,the firm thereby saving, through the inevitable loss of some of thesechecks, a proportion of payment as well known to them and as certainas the mortality rates of life insurance.\"An\\' so you went out, Carrie?\" she said.\"Yes; they turned down our committee at three o\\'clock this afternoon,and at three-fifteen we had all left the shops.  Oh, it was great!But they\\'ve got a lot of hands left, and they\\'ll have some of theirorders filled in Newark.  I don\\'t know how it will end.\"\"The bosses wouldn\\'t budge?\"\"Not an inch.  The most they did was to get some of us aside, eachaway from the rest, and offer us seven dollars a week apiece if we\\'dfix things up so that our friends would go back to work without anymore trouble.\"Katie, who well knew what seven dollars a week must mean to thiscalm, hardworking Lithuanian girl, who had come to America alone andwas saving to send her parents money enough to follow, shot asidelong glance at the speaker; but Carrie\\'s tone had not changed;she seemed unaware that she was narrating anything unusual.\"An\\' you turned down the offer?\" asked Katie.\"Last strike,\" said Carrie, \"one of those union girls was sent out tosell copies of a special edition of _The Call_ for the benefit of thestrikers.  She hadn\\'t had anything to eat for three days.  One mangave her a five-dollar bill for a single paper.  Nobody saw him giveit; she didn\\'t have to account for it; and she was nearly starved;but she came back and turned in that whole five dollars to the fund.That was one of the girls I was representing this afternoon.  Do yousuppose I could go back on such girls?  Do you suppose I could helpmyself when I knew it was hurting the others?\"Katie did not immediately reply, but her blue eyes shone.  Presentlyshe asked:\"Picket-duty, now, for yours?\"\"I began it right away.  I spoke to one scab as she came out--justasked her wouldn\\'t she join the union for her own good and ours--justlaid my hand on her wrist--but they had the cops ready and their ownstrong-arm men, and had three of them beating me for my pains.\"\"Pinched?\"\"Of course.  The magistrate let me off with a lecture on the rightsof every girl to work for starvation-wages if she felt like doing itand like making others starve.--But next time it will be a fine orthe workhouse.\"Katie had begun to busy herself with the preparations for her meal.She had warmed some coffee on the gas-stove and taken from thecupboard a roll and a few slices of dried beef.\"Look here,\" she said, stopping in the midst of this task; \"how muchmoney have you got?\"\"Oh, I\\'m all right, thanks.\"\"Maybe you are, but you might as well be better.  Now, the while thestrike lasts, just you give up that room acrost the hall an\\' comeover here with me.\"Carrie\\'s brown locks shook in doubtful refusal.\"You\\'re the real goods,\" she said; \"but I don\\'t have to do that.\"\"Of course you don\\'t have to, but I\\'d take it a real kindness.What\\'s the use o\\' keepin\\' a whole room to yourself when you\\'ll bespendin\\' parts of the time in jail?\"Carrie laughed.\"Will you let me pay half?\" she asked.\"Sure I will.\"\"Then perhaps----\"\"That\\'s settled,\" ended Katie, and it was arranged that Carrie\\'s fewsticks of furniture should be moved into the Irish girl\\'s quartersthe next morning.The details had just been settled when Hermann entered, his cheerfullips concluding the last bar of \"Die Wacht Am Rhein.\"\"Hello!\" said Katie, smiling.  \"Are you out of a job, too?  Or areyou just goin\\' to be late the night?\"Hermann pulled his cap from his blonde curls and, with blushingcheeks, grinned broadly.\"Needer,\" he answered.  \"I\\'m chust on my vay to de saloon.\"  Hetwisted his cap between his awkward fingers.  \"I vanted only to askyou somesing, Katie.\"\"All right.  Sit down an\\' ask it.  You know Carrie.  Don\\'t mind her.\"\"Sure I know her, only----\"Carrie rose.  She was aware of the pair\\'s relations, and too firmlybound by East Side etiquette to think it well to make of herself thatthird person who constitutes a crowd.\"I\\'ve got to be going,\" she said.\"Don\\'t you pay no attention to him,\" Katie objected.  \"Sit still.Have some coffee, Hermann-boy?\"But Hermann shook his head.\"No, thank you,\" he said.  \"I\\'ve got chust a minute.\"\"Then what was it you were wishin\\' to say?\"\"Aboud dot girl I dalked to you aboud on our vay to Coney.  You seenow you have a tshob, it seemed like ve might do somesing for her.\"Katie dropped all trace of banter.\"I\\'ll tell you how it is, Hermann,\" she said, and she did tell him.As soon as she had secured her place, she had determined to help.  Atpresent much financial assistance was impossible, and employmentthere was none.  It would be dangerous, moreover, to allconcerned--not least of all to Violet--for the girl to make a dashfor liberty in any manner that would give to Rose a chance to securevengeance through her friends the police.  But Katie was decided, andCarrie at once agreed, that, could the escape be arranged, Violetmight at least be sheltered in Katie\\'s room until some work should befound for her.\"All I want to know, Hermann-boy,\" concluded Katie, \"is however inthe world we\\'re goin\\' to get word to her.\"\"Dot\\'s chust vat I vanted fer to tell you aboud,\" said Hermann.  \"Youknow Conrad Schultz.  He\\'s now got my route vith de brewery-vagon.De stable\\'s chust two doors round de corner.  I\\'ve explained to him,und he\\'ll slip a note to Miss Violet the first dime he sees her.\"\"We\\'ll write to-night,\" said Carrie.\"An\\' I\\'ll hand it to him on my way to work in th\\' mornin\\',\" addedKatie.  \"Now you run along or you\\'ll be docked.\"Hermann assented, smiling.  He turned to the door, fumbled with theknob, and dropped his cap.  Katie, a steaming cup of coffee in onehand, stooped to recover it just as Hermann himself bent forward.  Inthe presence of a third person, the German felt a sudden thrill ofcourage.\"Ach, but you\\'re a goot girl, Katie!\" he cried.  \"Und here\\'s a liddlerevard fer it!\"He seized his cap, jerked her black head toward him, and imprinted aresounding kiss on her pink cheek.Katie laughed and broke free.  She spilled some of the coffee, butshe administered a smart blow with her open palm on the offendingmouth.\"You\\'d never dared to do it if you hadn\\'t thought I had me handsfull!\" she called after her lover as he clattered heavily and happilydown the stairs.  \"An\\' just in revenge for that,\" she added, stillblushing, to Carrie, as she closed the door, \"me an\\' you\\'ll go outfor a little spree of our own to-night.\"\"Where to?\" asked the factory-girl.\"To a dance,\" answered Katie.  \"Me feet have got that lazy walkin\\'after a job that I\\'m afraid they\\'ll forget all the dancin\\'-steps theyever knew, unless I hurry an\\' get some practicin\\' again.\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Carrie, doubtfully, \"I\\'ve got to get up early inthe morning.\"\"An\\' what about me?  Besides, haven\\'t I got me friend, thealarm-clock?\"\"But my jaw\\'s smashed from that fight.\"\"Who\\'ll see it?\"\"Let\\'s make it a moving-picture show.\"\"An\\' pay the same for half an hour\\'s headache that we could get awhole night\\'s dancin\\' for?\"\"I\\'ve got to be walking the picket-line all day to-morrow.\"\"Yes, an\\' I have to be standin\\' behind a counter.  You haven\\'t gotnothin\\' on me there.  Get your wraps together now an\\' come ahead,Carrie.  I hear there\\'s a new place opened on Grand Street.\"Carrie knew how to dance--the poorest girl on the East Side knowsthat, because not to dance is to miss the one amusement obtainable bythe very poor--and, like Katie, she was of that relatively small armythat can frequent the dance-halls for perhaps as much as a yearwithout contamination.  Before she had taken her course at thenight-school, she had even danced in the rooms that the Hebrewpoliticians provide behind their saloons near Houston Street, whereshe had seen cadets successfully ply their trade among bland-facedimmigrant girls whose very language was unknown to them; and she wastherefore wholly prepared for the picture that she confronted when,Katie having paid her ten cents for the two admissions, they enteredthe low-ceilinged basement of a saloon and tenement-house, and cameupon the meeting-place of the Danny Delancy Social Club.Through a veil of dust raised by stamping feet and swirling skirts,through a cloud of heat from a room with every window closed, througha blast of odors compounded of the fumes of alcohol, the scent oftobacco, and the miasma of sweating men and women, there rose, fromsomewhere, the cries of a beaten piano, struck and thumped into ashrieking likeness to the \"Chocolate Soldier\" waltz, which only nowand then was made at all audible above the rhythmic hubbub.  Althoughthe evenings of Saturdays and Sundays were the most popular fordancing, the floor was so crowded that only the expertness of thesetrained dancers prevented collision and panic.  The steam from thebodies of the performers joined with the dry dust in half obscuringthe blue-burning gas.  The strident laughter of the patrons helpedthe scraping of their feet in subduing the sounds of the piano.  Themen gyrated grimly in wet shirt-sleeves, and the women, affecting themost somber shades chosen for the longest wear, spun in theirpartners\\' arms with stolid, gum-grinding jaws and lips that weremirthless.  Except for the youthful \"spielers\" admitted withoutcharge, or even hired, to dance with the awkward or make wall-flowerssufficiently happy to insure their return, there were but two typesof men among the patrons.  There was the native of the quarter,heavy-faced, large-muscled, quick to anger and ready with the fists,a hard-drinking, hard-living sort, no more careful of his neighbor\\'smorals than of his own, yet good-natured, easy-going, pliable.  Andwinding in and out among these, slow and suave, like some sleekspecies of vulture, were the young men that came there not forpleasure, but for profit, always-smiling young men with mannersoffensively elaborate, whose shining black hair smelled of oil, whoseskin was like decaying dough, and whose entire time was spent inmaking the acquaintance of new girls, giving dancing-lessons to newgirls in crowded corners, and taking new girls into the adjoiningback-bar for a drink.To these types the attending women more or less corresponded.  Mostof them came alone, or in groups of two or three--a plain girl alwaysbefriended by one of more charm--because etiquette demanded that, ifa man brought a companion, his companion must give him what dances hewanted, and so she would have few offers from his fellows, whoobserved a rigid code that forbade poaching upon a friend\\'s preserve.There were some that could afford to wear gay dresses because theywere frankly in a business that, of however brief duration, made gaydresses possible as a luxury and necessary as an advertisement, andthis appearance of wealth was never absent from the hungry eyes ofthe young women about them.  There were others, also few, who wereplainly new either to the country or to this particular form ofamusement.  But the majority came from the factories and shops, luredby nothing worse than youth\\'s natural craving for its right topleasure, seeking to forget the exertions of the day in these newexertions of the night, drifting whither they neither knew norgreatly cared, the necessary factors of an industrial system toofatuous to conserve their efficiency.On every chair along the reeking walls, now trodden underfoot on thefloor, and now picked up like dry leaves and twirled about in thelittle eddies of warm air created by the romping dancers, were cardsand handbills--\"throwaways\" the patrons called them--which, often incurious English, announced special balls and \"grand receptions\"shortly to be given in this or some similar club.  Here one was\"cordially invited\" to the \"third annual dance given by the twowell-known friends, Greaser Einstein and Kid Boslair, at NewStarlight Hall, Gents Twenty-five and Ladies Fifteen\"; there one wascautioned not to miss the \"Devil Dance\" that would form a part of theforthcoming \"reception of the Harry Cronin Association, Young Theo,floor-manager\"; and again, one was told that the \"Special Extra Eventof the Season\" would be the ball of the \"Ryan McCall Social,Incorporated, Tammany Hall, ticket admit gent including wardrobe,Thirty-five cents; ladies free.\"Katie and the shirtwaist-maker got seats near the door, waved andcalled to half a dozen acquaintances and strained their eyes to seethrough the swirling mist.\"It looks like old times,\" said Carrie.\"Smells like \\'em,\" Katie amended; \"only I\\'ve been away from theseplaces for awhile an\\' I notice that, new place or old, the faceschange pretty quick.  Who\\'s the woman in red, with the yellow hair,Carrie?\"She pointed to a figure spinning about the center of the room, hercrimson skirt flying far behind her like the trail of a comet.\"I know her,\" said Carrie.  \"A year ago she came to New York from thecountry to find work.  When she was about starved, she rang a bellunder the sign \\'Helping Hand Home\\'--she didn\\'t know what that meantexcept that it meant charity.  The superintendent told her his placecouldn\\'t do anything for her; she might be spoiled by associatingwith the people he helped; his mission was for bad women that weresorry; not for good women that hadn\\'t anything to be sorry about.\\'But I\\'m hungry,\\' she told him.  \\'Can\\'t help it,\\' he said; \\'you\\'renot qualified.\\'  This girl went away, and came back a month later.\\'I don\\'t want to come in just yet,\\' she said; \\'but I do want to tellyou that I\\'m qualified now\\'--and she was.\"Katie took the facts for what, amid surroundings where such facts areplentiful, they seemed worth.\"Hard luck,\" she said, though not without meaning.\"Yes, and look at her clothes.\"\"That\\'s the trouble,\" said Katie; \"we can\\'t help lookin\\' at them--thelikes of us--any more than she can help wearin\\' them.  It\\'s that or atenement with two dark rooms an\\' the rent raised every year.\"They danced, for among the soberer men there were many that knewthem, and neither girl remembered the weariness of her work in theexhaustion of her dancing.  Between dances, in the dressing-room,they talked with their acquaintances among the girls, gossiping ofthe men and the other women, and now and then, their throats dry andtheir faces streaming, they were taken into the dingy side-bar andwere bought a glass of beer.As midnight drew closer the dance became more stormy.  Many of theworking-girls went home, and their places were filled by women of thebrighter dressed class.  There were some that were plainly drunk, andthese clumsily imitated the suggestive contortions of the salarieddancers now sent upon the floor to stimulate the amateurs.  One girl,in a cleared space surrounded by laughing men and envious, thoughapparently scornful, women, performed a dance popularly supposed tobe forbidden by the police.  There were several fights, and in oneespecially nasty scuffle a lad was badly cut by the knife of ajealous partner.\"I guess that\\'s about plenty for us,\" observed Katie, as she andCarrie shouldered their way from the crowd surrounding the woundedboy and his shrieking assailant.Both girls were sufficiently familiar with such episodes to acceptthem with calm, but both were at last tired out.\"I suppose you\\'re right,\" Carrie assented, \"though I did have a goodtime.\"\"An\\' it was you didn\\'t want to come!\" grinned Katie as they went outupon the cool street.\"I know.\"  Carrie\\'s round face grew hard and puzzled.  \"I know,\" sheadmitted, \"only sometimes----\"\"Och, come on, an\\' cheer up!  We must write our letter for thebrewery-man before we get to bed, Carrie-girl.\"They did write it, but Carrie, when she had gone into her own roomfor the last night she was to spend there, sat for some timemotionless upon the edge of the cot.\"I know,\" she repeated as if to some invisible confessor; \"I knowboth sides of it, and, honestly, I don\\'t know which is worse.  I knowall that can be said, only--sometimes--I wonder----\"XIIIJAIL-DELIVERYRose was ill--she had been drinking too much for the past week--andViolet, in her no longer fresh red kimona, was in the kitchen talkingto Cassie when, one morning, the new driver of the brewery-wagonstopped at the door.\"Morning,\" he said with what at once struck Violet, who was nowconstantly on the watch, as a visible effort at nonchalance.Conrad Schultz was a tall, raw-boned German-American, with a longnose and pale, sorrowful mustache, but with an eye in the ceruleandepths of which there lurked the cold fire of reliable strategy.\"Come in,\" said Violet, \"an\\' have a drop of something.\"\"Thanks.\"He came in cumbersomely, and took an uneasy seat.\"Some chilly for this season,\" he remarked, with a cool glance in thedirection of the ebony Cassie, hovering glumly in the background.Violet thought she caught the meaning of the man, whom she knew wasHermann Hoffmann\\'s successor.\"It is chilly for this time of year,\" she said.  \"What will you have?It better be something warming.  There\\'s whiskey here, or, if youdon\\'t mind waiting till Cassie goes for it, there\\'s some good brandyin the cellar.\"Schultz appeared to hesitate, and Violet, watching him, could not,for a moment, decide whether there was, after all, any foundation forthe hope that his appearance had wakened.\"Well, if it ain\\'t no trouble,\" he at last blurted, \"I would like ataste of real brandy.\"\"Cassie,\" said Violet, \"bring up a fresh bottle of brandy forMr.--Mr.----\"\"Schultz,\" prompted that individual.\"For Mr. Schultz, Cassie.\"Cassie, however, seemed to have scented surrounding mystery.\"Ah reckon there\\'s a bottle som\\'ares about yhere, Miss Vi\\'let,\" shedemurred.\"No, there isn\\'t.\"\"But, Miss Vi\\'let, there was one jes\\' half empty las\\' night.\"\"Miss Rose took that to bed with her.  Don\\'t talk so much.  Go downan\\' get a fresh bottle for Mr. Schultz.\"The girl left the room slowly and sullenly.Schultz sat silent and motionless until a moment had followed theclosing of the door.  Then the cold flame was relighted in his eye.\"She called you Miss Violet?\" he asked, though still in the mostcommonplace of tones.\"That\\'s my name.\"\"Did you ever talk to the man that had my job before I had it?\"Violet, with the catlike quiet and ease that always characterized hermovements, stepped to the door through which Cassie had just passed.She flung it quickly open.  The black girl nearly fell headlong intothe room.Without an instant\\'s hesitation, Violet did the one effective thing.She smacked the negress smartly across the face.\"I heard you!\" she said, in tones that were all the moreawe-inspiring because they were low.  \"What do you mean by spying onme, you black devil?  Think I want to cheat the house?  I\\'d not be soclumsy about it, if I did!  Think I\\'m trying to skidoo?  I\\'d walk outif I felt like it!  I\\'ll go right to Miss Rose about this, an\\' haveyou fired so quick you won\\'t have time to pack your duds!\"The servant remained as she had sprawled.\"Oh, please don\\', miss!\" she wailed.  \"Please don\\' tell Miss Rose!Ah wasn\\'t tryin\\' to spy on youse.  Ah jes\\' drapped somethin\\' yhere,an\\' ah was jes\\' tryin\\' to fin\\'----\"\"Don\\'t you lie to me,\" said Violet, her cheeks, now always so wan inthe morning light, flushing to something like their former color.\"Get up off your knees.\"\"Miss Vi\\'let, please don\\' tell on me.\"The black girl\\'s voice threatened to rise to a dangerous wail.\"All right,\" said Violet, quickly.  \"I\\'ll let it go this time; butyou hurry up and get that brandy, or I might change my mind.  Pullthe cork while you\\'re at it, and fetch a decent glass from thedining-room.\"Cassie, murmuring thanks with her thick lips, and wiping her eyeswith the big knuckles of her right fist, scrambled to her feet, andstarted again upon her errand.This time Violet left the door open.  She waited till the servant wasout of earshot.  Then she opened the door to the back stairway, whichshe herself had twice used to excellent purpose, and, finding nobodythere, returned to Schultz.\"Got something for me?\" she whispered.But no haste upon her part would speed his Teutonic caution.\"I asked you,\" he said, as if he had not observed the littleencounter through which he had sat serene and unconcerned, \"whetheryou knew the man who had my job before what I had it.\"\"Yes--yes, I knew him.  Quick!\"\"And your name is Miss Violet?\"\"You heard the girl call me that.  Can\\'t you hustle?\"\"I don\\'t want to hustle.  If you\\'re the girl I want, you\\'ve kept mewaitin\\' here three mornings already.\"\"Well, I\\'m the person all right.  You know that now.  Oh, won\\'t youplease hurry?  Don\\'t you see how things are here?\"\"I seen enough to make me want to go slow.\"\"You\\'re going slow all right.  What more do you want to know?  Italked to the man you\\'re telling me about and he said he\\'d see whathe could do.\"Her replies came with the rapidity of musketry, but Schultz spokewith stubborn deliberation.\"Was that all he told you?\"\"Sure it was.\"\"Nothin\\' more?\"\"No.--Can\\'t you hurry?  Can\\'t you believe me?--He didn\\'t say nomore.--Quick!--Oh, yes, he said he\\'d talk to his girl Katie aboutme.--Quick!--Hush-t!  Here she comes!\"Cassie\\'s step sounded only a few yards away, but Schultz, nowapparently satisfied of Violet\\'s identity, displayed an unlooked forspeed.  The heavy hand that had been clumsily reposing in the bulgingside-pocket of his coat shot free.  Violet seized a fist that openedand withdrew as her own fingers closed on a bit of paper.Cassie entered to find them the width of the kitchen apart.  Violetwas pouring herself a drink of whiskey into a soiled glass, and, ifher hand trembled, the silk swathed back that was presented to theservant hid all tokens of nervousness.She waited until Schultz had slowly drunk his brandy.  She waited toexchange a few more words and to see him go.  She even waited alittle longer in order not to make her retreat too patently hurriedand in order to subdue by threats and cajolery whatever suspicionsmight still be lingering in the black breast of the apparentlypenitent Cassie.  But at last she made her way to her own room andunrolled the bit of paper.It was a letter dated from Katie\\'s address four days previous to theday of its receipt, and it was couched in stiff and formalphraseology.  She read:\"Miss VIOLET,\"_Dear Miss Violet--_\"This is to inform you that I am Miss Katie Flanagan, particularfriend of Mr. Hermann Hoffmann, who used to drive the brewery-wagonthat left beer at your house.  He told me about you and what youwant, and I told a lady friend, Miss Carrie Berkowicz, who is comingto live with me.  I have just got into a small job and Carrie hasjust got out of one, and we don\\'t know of none yet for you, but we\\'llkeep looking and sure will find one, and meantime we want you to comehere and stop with us just as soon as you can beat it from that placewhere you are.  Don\\'t you lose your nerve, and don\\'t bother to talkabout things when you get here, because we know how it is.  Youneedn\\'t worry about how we feel, we have too many friends who had thesame bad luck as you, and least said soonest mended, we think.  Socome right here first chance you get and stay as long as you like,and if we\\'re not home when you get here sit on the step till we doget home, and if anybody asks any questions just say you\\'re a friendof ours, because you are, and that\\'s none of their business anyhow,and nobody won\\'t bother you any more.\"Now keep your head cool and God bless you with best wishes!  \"From your friend          \"MISS KATIE FLANAGAN.\"Without daring to lessen her courage by giving way to the feelingsthat this letter stirred, Violet read it twice, tore off the address,concealed it in one of the \"rats\" on which the structure of herrusset hair was founded, and then tore the rest of the epistle intosmall bits, which she flung out of the narrow space between theriveted shutters of her room.  She was now almost ready to strike.In her captivity, she had, after the first shock, made it herbusiness to learn what she could of those about her.  She knew thatWesley Dyker had once been what was called a straw-bail man, an agentwho, for a high consideration, provided bogus bail for such women asthe police, to keep up appearances, were forced from time to time toarrest.  She had been told that he was wont, for a still higherconsideration, to appear at court for these clients, in the rôle of adefender of the wronged poor, and in a very different rôle in theirbehalf with the dispensers of justice to the underworld.  She hadgathered that his friendship with one political faction aided insecuring Rose the chance to purchase that expensive police-protectiontoward which Angel, unknown to Dyker, assisted Rose through anopposing faction.  And she believed that his ambition was now to gaina magistracy from which he could grant bail on bonds signed by hisown servants, secure for prisoners the legal service of men thatwould return him a commission, and pronounce judgment or dispensemercy for the furtherance of his own fortune and the strengthening ofhis own power.  Out of these threads of knowledge Violet resolved toweave the net in which to catch freedom.That afternoon Evelyn informed her that Rose was still abed and hadsent for her favorite, Wanda, to console her.  This meant that shewould not descend to the ground floor or be visible to any visitorsbefore the next evening, and that the Englishwoman, promoted totemporary command, would have to pass the night in that reception ofcallers which necessitated the appearance of drinking much and thefact of drinking almost nothing.\"She does that every time she goes on a bust, my dear,\" complainedEvelyn.  \"Of course she jolly well knows that she can trust me andthat I have some manners too, but I wish she would remember that Ialso have a thirst and can\\'t do without my drop of real liquor.\"Violet\\'s nerves tingled.  With her best effort to bury all signs ofher mounting hope, she ventured:\"I wish I could help you.\"\"You, my dear?\"  Evelyn\\'s eyebrows raised and her contralto voicefollowed them.  \"Catch the madam letting anyone but me take charge!You know you\\'re none of you allowed down in the front hall unlessyou\\'re sent for.  Things are ticklish enough, thank you, with thatnew girl upstairs.\"It was almost the first mention that had been made to Violet of thelatest captive since the recent day of Evelyn\\'s exposition of theentire traffic.  Violet had not dared to ask any more questions thanthose that she deemed necessary for the perfection of her own plans,and she dared ask none now.\"I do hate the job,\" Evelyn was continuing, \"even if it does mean afew bits extra.  Rose says that fellow Dyker is due to-night.  She\\'snot fit to see him above all men, and he\\'s the one I mostparticularly hate to meet, because he was a friend of my friend thedoctor and used to call with him now and again at my flat.  I alwaysfancy he\\'s making comparisons under those narsty low lids of his.\"Violet, in sudden reaction, felt choking with despair.\"I could see him,\" she said.But Evelyn\\'s honors sat heavily upon their possessor.\"You\\'re not a trusty yet, my dear, by any manner of means,\" sheresponded.  \"No, no; you will go to your own room after dinner andstay there till you are wanted.\"She tilted her sharp chin and strolled kitchenward for a drink; but,though she left behind Her a Violet discouraged, it was not a Violetbeaten.In fact, the girl made her own opportunity.  Noticing that eveningthat Evelyn took up a dignified position in the parlor and had Cassieconduct all the guests thither, Violet quickly disposed of the firstperson that claimed her attention, and, having made her besttoilet--having restored her cheeks to a resemblance of their pristineglow, coiffed her russet hair, and donned her best of linen--shedescended quietly to the first landing on the stairway, there to takeup her watch.  Before she was again in demand, she saw the servantadmit Wesley Dyker.  She ran quickly downward and, just as Cassiestepped forward to precede him, brushed by him in the rosy twilightof the hall.\"Ask to see me,\" she whispered.  \"Ask to see Violet.  Don\\'t let on Itold you.  I\\'ve heard something you want to know about O\\'Malley.\"Before the man\\'s shadowy figure could come to pause, she had passedhim and caught up to Cassie.\"Where have you been?\" she asked.  \"I\\'ve been calling for you forfive minutes.  I need some more water in my room.\"She turned and reascended the stairs, but her door had not long beenclosed before the servant was knocking upon the panel.\"Here\\'s you\\' water, Miss Vi\\'let,\" said Cassie.  \"An\\' Miste\\' Dykerwants fer to see you daown in de back parlor.\"Violet took the useless pitcher, made sure that the remnant ofKatie\\'s note was secure in its hiding-place, and hurried, with Cassiefollowing, to the garish room in which Dyker was awaiting her.He was seated on the lazy, pillowed sofa on which Violet had fallenasleep so soon after her arrival in this house.  He was inevening-clothes that served him, on the East Side, much as theadvertised portraits of certain patent-medicine makers serve theirproprietors, the flaccid whiteness of his face still bearing tracesof past beauty, the weakness of his mouth hidden by his crisp, short,brown mustache, and his heavy lids concealing the secret of hissteel-gray eyes.He half rose as she entered, but she motioned him to sit still.\"Hello!\" she said, with the easy manner of the house, which alwaysseemed to presuppose a previous acquaintance.  \"Have you orderedanything?  I\\'m terribly dry.\"He took her hand and caught her meaning,\"So am I, Miss Violet,\" he answered.  \"Let\\'s have something.\"Violet turned to the servant.\"Cassie,\" she said, \"bring up a couple of bottles.\"She waited for the door to close, and then sat down beside Dyker.\"Speak low,\" she cautioned.  \"That girl will listen if she can.You\\'ll have to pretend to be making love to me.\"Dyker regarded her with smiling approval.  Her blue eyes shone withexcitement and red blood fought through the rouge on cheek and fullyripe mouth.\"What you ask will be both easy and pleasant,\" he answered.\"No, no; none of that.  This is no time for bluffing.  Put your armaround my shoulder.  That way.  Now then, you heard what I told youin the hall?\"Dyker, with his type\\'s disinclination to take seriously anything thatany woman has to say upon serious matters, smiled assent.\"You seem to have been doing some listening yourself,\" he said, ashis lingers tightened unnecessarily upon her shoulder.\"Yes, I did, and it\\'s lucky for you I did it.  Will you promise notto give me away?\"\"Of course I promise.\"\"Not even to Miss Rose?\"\"Not even to Rosie.\"\"And if I help you, will you do me a favor?\"\"To look at you I should say that I\\'d do you any favor you asked, anddo it without expecting anything in return.\"His pale lips were curled in a half-scoffing smile, but Violet\\'s nextwords brushed from his flaccid face all traces of amusement.\"You remember that night you told Miss Rose about what you wanted toget at the next election?  You said you were afraid of O\\'Malleygiving you the double cross.\"Dyker stiffened.\"Did you hear that?\" he demanded.\"Hush!  Keep your voice down, or I won\\'t tell you nothing of what Iknow.  Remember you\\'re supposed to be making love to me.\"\"All right, all right; but I want an answer to my question.\"\"Well, then, of course, I heard it.  I was at the keyholethere--that\\'s why I want you to whisper now.--And I heard more.\"\"What was that?\"\"Wait a minute.  You\\'ll do me a favor if I tell you?\"\"Anything,\" he smiled.\"But this is business.  If I tell you something that it\\'s worth yourwhile to know, will you promise not to blow on me to Miss Rose?\"\"I promise.\"\"And to do something more that I\\'ll ask you?\"Wesley was now certain that he must not stick at promises.\"Surely.\"\"Then sit tight.  I don\\'t know as much about O\\'Malley as I pretendedout there in the hall, but I do know about Miss Rose.  I don\\'t knowwhether O\\'Malley is goin\\' to double-cross you or not, but I do knowthat Miss Rose has given you the double-cross already.\"She had thought that passion played a large part in his relationswith her mistress, and she had counted upon awakening his jealousy.What, however, had far exceeded his affection was a poor pride ofpossession, and when Violet\\'s words, in addition to touching hisambition, struck at that pride, they aroused an anger that was farmore dangerous than any sense of love betrayed.\"What\\'s that?\" he demanded.Two red beacons flashed into his pale checks, and his heavy lids,shooting upward for a single instant, disclosed hard, gray eyes gonehot and malevolent.\"Be careful.  Speak low, I tell you,\" she cautioned; \"and rememberyour promise.\"\"I don\\'t believe----\"\"Here\\'s Cassie!\"They waited while the black opened the champagne and filled theglasses.Violet brushed Dyker\\'s hair over his eyes and laughed at the effect.Dyker caught the offending hand and kissed it by way of punishment.\"Cassie,\" he banteringly asked, \"why didn\\'t you ever tell me therewas such a nice little girl in this house?  I had to get the newsfrom a friend on the outside.\"He tossed the now grinning negress a dollar and, as soon as she hadleft them, dropped the farce as promptly as did Violet.\"I say I can\\'t believe you,\" he resumed, the two spots of anger stillglowering in his cheeks.Violet knew that her whole hope rested upon her ability to forceconviction.\"You\\'ve got to believe me,\" she said.  \"I\\'ll tell you all that youtold Miss Rose till I had to run away, that evening.\"She did it, omitting scarcely a particular.\"That\\'s right, ain\\'t it?\" she concluded.\"May be.  But what does that prove?  It only shows that you heard me.\"\"It shows that I can hear Miss Rose when she talks to somebody else.And I did hear her.\"\"Whom was she talking to?\"\"The man you asked her about.  To Rafael Angelelli.\"\"Well, but I told her to talk to him.\"\"An\\' she did it.  But the first time I heard her was just before youtold her to.\"\"That same night?\"\"He was in the kitchen with her when you came in.  Why, he\\'s here allthe time!  I don\\'t care what she pretends to you, she\\'s stuck on him,an\\' every girl in the house knows it.\"Rapidly, but as fully as she had sketched the dialogue between Roseand Dyker, she now described the first conversation that she hadoverheard between her mistress and the Italian.\"I\\'d come down to graft a drink,\" she said, \"an\\' I heard them fromthe stairs.  That\\'s how, after he\\'d left, I came to listen to youtoo.\"Dyker had quailed under the revelation, thus made to him, ofpolitical danger.  He now quivered in anger at the comments uponhimself, somewhat colored, that Violet had placed in the mouths ofRose and Angel.\"I\\'ll find out about this!\" he said, struggling against the desperatearms flung swiftly around him to keep him on the sofa.  \"Let me go!By God, I\\'ll have that drunken cat down here and squeeze the truthout of her throat!\"All the caution, all the craft, all that she had counted upon as thereal Wesley Dyker seemed to have escaped him.  His voice was stilllow, but in every other respect he was a raging beast.She fought with him, mentally and physically.\"You can\\'t get anything out of her that way,\" Violet urged, as theman twisted under her strong hands.  \"Of course she\\'ll say it\\'s alllies.  And you\\'d only be warning her.  You don\\'t want her to knowthat you know; you want a chance to block her game.\"Partly convinced by this argument and partly subdued by the physicalrestraint that accompanied it, Dyker ceased his struggles.\"But I want to be sure,\" he muttered sullenly.\"You can\\'t be sure by goin\\' to Miss Rose.\"\"Well, I ought to tell her.\"  The high tide of his anger was slowlysubsiding, and the rocky Dyker that she had built on was beginning toshow its crest above the still hissing waves.  \"Look here, Violet,\"he said, \"I\\'m sorry I behaved like such a fool.  I beg your pardon,but you must see that I have got to put this thing up to Rose.\"\"You forget your promise.\"\"No, I don\\'t, but I must make sure.\"Violet thought rapidly.\"Listen,\" she said; \"I told you I wanted you to do something for mean\\' you gave your word you\\'d do it.--Will you?\"\"Of course I will, only I\\'m thinking a little about myself.\"\"This will help you, too.\"\"What do you want?\"Violet drew a long breath.\"I want you to go over to the avenue right away,\" she said, \"and buyme a long cloak and a hat and bring them back, and then take me outof here without a word to anybody.  You needn\\'t walk more\\'n threesquares with me, an\\' then I won\\'t bother you no more.\"Dyker drew away and whistled softly.  His face grew quite composedagain.  The heavy lids fell over his eyes.\"So that\\'s it, is it?\" he asked.\"I want to get away,\" said Violet.\"And so you\\'ve cooked up this little mess of lies to make me thegoat, eh?\"Violet felt the sands slipping beneath her feet.  She laced herfingers together till the knuckles bruised her flesh.\"Don\\'t do that,\" she pleaded; \"don\\'t take it that way; it\\'s true,what I told you, every word of it.  I only want you to keep yourpromise to me.\"She stopped with a sob, and waited.Wesley reached calmly for a glass of wine, drank it, put down theglass, thrust his hands deep into his trousers\\' pockets, and,stretching out his long legs, regarded, humming, the toes of hisshining pumps.\"I don\\'t believe you,\" he said at last.\"But, Mr. Dyker----\"\"It\\'s too thin.\"\"Even if it was a lie,\" Violet despairingly persisted, \"you ought tohelp me.  Do you know who I am?\"\"That\\'s the point.\"\"Do you know how I was brought here?\"\"I can guess.\"\"I was tricked.  The man said he wanted to marry me.  I didn\\'t know.I believed him.  An\\' they beat me an\\' starved me and did things Icouldn\\'t think about an\\' couldn\\'t help thinkin\\' about.  An\\' all Iwant is just for you to do me this one little favor.  I won\\'t botheryou.  I won\\'t blow on you----\"\"What\\'s that?\"\"Oh, you know I wouldn\\'t blow on you!  I couldn\\'t.  I want to forgetthe whole thing.  I\\'ve got friends to go to who\\'ll get me work.  Ionly want you to get me out of the door and safe away.\"Like most men of his sort Dyker, although ready enough to make aliving out of the results of cruelty, hated the sight of cruelty\\'sself.  The girl\\'s words touched, though lightly, his selfish heart.\"But I can\\'t afford to help you,\" he protested.  \"You see how I\\'mtied up here.  I can\\'t have Rose jump on me now.\"\"You know she\\'s jumping on you already.  You know she\\'s knifing youin the back.  The only way you can stop her is by using what I\\'vetold you.\"\"Of course,\" said Dyker in the tone of a man thinking aloud, \"if shereally was playing both ends against the middle, I could pull herteeth by going straight to O\\'Malley and telling him so.\"Violet did not wholly understand this, but she agreed immediately.\"Of course you could,\" she said.\"And I suppose I could have her pinched then, if you\\'d testifyagainst her.  Would you do that?  Would you go into court?\"Violet\\'s fingers closed spasmodically.\"Just give me the chanc\\'t,\" she said fervently.\"And of course there are other girls who\\'ve been in the same scrapehere?\"\"There\\'s a new one upstairs this minute.\"\"There is?  Um.  That\\'s good.\"  He rattled the money in his pocket.\"Only, look here,\" he persisted, \"if you have been telling the truth,it will probably make me solid with O\\'Malley, but if you haven\\'t,I\\'ll go clean to smash.\"Violet saw the turn of affairs and, with hope\\'s revival, her mindcleared immediately.\"I haven\\'t told you all,\" she said, \"and I guess the rest will makeyou sure enough.\"\"There\\'s more then?\"\"A lot.\"\"What is it?\"\"Will you help me out of here?\"\"If you convince me.--Let\\'s see; the shops around here are stillopen.--Yes, if you convince me, you\\'ll be out of here in half anhour.\"It was her only chance.  She did not hesitate.  She told him thewhole of what she had heard of the later assuring interview betweenRose and Angelelli.This time he listened quietly, his face inscrutable.\"That all?\" he asked when she had ended.\"That\\'s all,\" she said.\"It\\'s the truth?\"\"Ain\\'t I sayin\\' it proof that it\\'s true?  How could I make it up?  Idon\\'t know all that it means.\"\"You knew enough to pass it on to me.\"\"Lucky for you I did, too; but I don\\'t know all it means--how couldI?--and you do know, an\\' that ought to be proof enough that it\\'sGod\\'s truth, Mr. Dyker.\"She stopped.  Her case was with the jury.Dyker rose.\"Cassie!\" he called.Violet leaped to her feet and laid her hands on his arm.\"What are you goin\\' to do?\" she whispered.He silenced her with a gesture.\"What you want,\" he said.Cassie put her black head in at the door.\"Cassie,\" he continued, flipping the maid another dollar, \"I\\'m alittle off my feed.  I\\'m going to the drugstore on the corner and getfixed up.\"\"Thank you, Miste\\' Dyker.--Ah kin go fer you, Miste\\' Dyker,\" said thenegress.  \"Thank you, sah.\"\"No, thanks, Cassie, I can go myself; I want the air.  But you can dosomething else for me.  You can just not let this girl run away fromme.  I know she would run if she could, but I like her too well tolet her, so if anybody wants her, just you say she\\'s in here andengaged for the evening by me.  I\\'ll be back in fifteen minutes.\"He left one door as the willingly assenting Cassie closed the other,and Violet flung herself on the sofa and buried her face in thecushions, now fearful that the servant, notwithstanding theirprecautions, had overheard her, now afraid that Dyker would changehis purpose and fail to return, and again dreading that he mightbetray her to Rose.  Since the night she had waited for Max totelephone in the café, since the terrible morning that had followed,it was the longest quarter of an hour that she had known, but it atlast dragged its quivering length away.  The doorbell rang.  Cassiepassed through the room to find Violet sitting suddenly upright, andat once returned with Dyker, his summer raincoat tossed across hisarm.As the servant left them, he lifted the coat.  Below it, not wrappedin the paper usual to a new purchase, was a dark cloak.  He unrolledit, uncovered a beaver hat, and handed them both to the pantingViolet.\"Here you are,\" he said quietly.She seized them and began to put them on.\"No,\" he cautioned, \"on second thought, I guess I\\'d better carrythem.  The parlor door\\'s open, and Evelyn and Fritzie are in therewith a couple of men.  I\\'ll go ahead and open the vestibule door andthe front door.  Then you come by as if you were going upstairs.\"\"Evelyn\\'ll come out to see if I have any money.\"\"She\\'ll never learn that, though here, by the way, is a ten-dollarbill that will come in handy.--The doors will be open and I\\'ll be onthe pavement.  Keep only a yard behind me.  Riley\\'s at the other endof his beat, and I have a cab at the curb.  Ready?\"She could not speak, but she nodded her russet head.He passed before her up the rosy twilight of the hall.Violet, following, her lips tight, her breathing suspended, her heartpounding against her breast, was dimly aware of her own softfootfalls sounding hideously loud, of the blast of light and laughterfrom the parlor.Dyker flung wide the vestibule door.\"Good-night!\" he called to Evelyn.\"Going?  Good-night!\" Violet heard the Englishwoman answer.She heard Evelyn rise.  She heard the front door open.  She sawWesley raise his arm.She hurried by the parlor door, and then, instead of turning to thestairs, gathered up her red kimona and ran through the vestibule,through a patch of soft, fresh darkness, and was tossed precipitatelyinto a cab into which Dyker followed her just as the horse, under aquick blow, dashed madly up the street.At the open cab-window the night air beat upon her fevered face.  Shedrank it deep into her thirsting lungs.  It was the wine of freedom.XIVRIVINGTON STREETThe eastern end of Rivington Street is a hectic thoroughfare.  Oftenit is so hectic as to be no thoroughfare at all, but only a tossingfever-dream, a whirling phantasmagoria of noisy shadows, grotesqueand reasonless.  It seems a street with a bad conscience, for itnever sleeps.The dawn, even in summertime, hesitates long before it comesshivering up from the crowded East River to drop a few grudged raysof anæmic light on Rivington Street.  Already, out of the hummingcourts, the black alleys, and the foul passages that feed this avenueas gutters feed a sewer, a long funeral procession of littlehandcarts has groped its way and taken a mournful stand beside thefetid curbs; and soon, pausing at these carts to buy the rank morselsof breakfast that there is never time to eat at home, the gray armyof the workers begins to scurry westward.First come the market-laborers, with shoulders bowed and musclescramped from the bearing of many burdens.  Upon their heels march thepale conscripts of the sweatshops, their hands shaking, their cheekssunken, their eyes hot from loss of sleep.  Follow the sad-lippedfactory-girls, women before their time, old women before their youth,and then the long line of predestined shop-clerks, most of them stillin short skirts and all of them, befittingly, in mourning-black.Swiftly they go, the whole corps of them, the whole corps strangelysilent.The street is not emptied of them before it is filled again, now bysolemn children on their way to school, children whose gaze is fixed,whose mouths are maturely set, and whose voices, when they are heardat all, are high, strident, nervous.  As these go by, the shops beginto do business: the cheap food-shops, the old-clothes shops, theshops that sell second-hand five-cent novels for a copper, and thepawnbrokers\\'.  The shawl-hooded housewives clutter in and out,selling first that they may buy afterward, and continuing like antsswarming about an ant-hill until noon strikes and the children paradestolidly away from school for luncheon, and back again.At that hour the underworld of Rivington Street enough recovers fromits drunkenness of the night preceding to stagger forth and drinkagain.  The doors of the shouldering saloons swing open and bang shutin a running accompaniment, and the highway rocks with it until acloud of clattering two-wheeled push-carts swoops from \"The Push-CartGarage\" around the corner and alights as if it were a plague ofpestilent flies.  Bearded Jews propel these, Jews with shiningderbies far back upon their heads, who work sometimes for themselves,but more often for the owners of the push-cart trust, who squabblefor positions in the gutter where an impotent law forbids any of themlong to remain, but where, once entrenched, they stand for hours,selling stockings at five cents and shirts at ten, mirrors andvegetables, suspenders and lithographs, shoestrings andpicture-postcards, collars of linen and celluloid, all sorts of cheapdress-material, every description of brush, fruit, and cigar-butts.The carts are end-to-end now; one could walk upon them fromcross-street to cross-street.  Each has its separate gasoline torchleaping up, in flame and smoke, to the descending darkness.  Uponthem charge the returning army of workers.  The crowd is all movingeastward; you could not make six yards of progress to the west; thesidewalks overflow, the street is filled.  The silence of the morninghas changed to a mad chorus of discords.  The thousand weary feetshuffle, the venders shriek their wares; there is every imaginablesound of strife and traffic, but there is no distinguishable note ofmirth.  Wagons jostle pedestrians, graze children, are blocked, heldup, turned away.  The thoroughfare is like a boiling cauldron; it canhold no more, and still it must hold more and more.Only very slowly, as the night wears on, do the crowd and noiselessen; but at last, by tardy degrees, they do lessen.Imperceptibly, but inevitably, even this portion of New York breathessomewhat easier.  By twos and threes the people melt away; a note ata time, the cries weaken and the shuffling dies; and finally, in thesmall hours of the morning, Rivington Street turns over, with atroubled sigh, to a restless doze.But to doze only.  Its bad conscience will grant it no absoluteoblivion, no perfect rest, however brief.  Cats yell from the dizzyedges of the lower roofs; dogs howl from the doorsteps.  Back in thenarrow courts and alleys and passages, drunken battles are won andlost.  The elevated cars roar out the minutes through the nocturnaldistances.  An ambulance clangs into a byway street.  A patrol-wagonclatters past.  Rivington Street turns and tosses on its hot couch,and through its dreams slink hideous shadows that dare not showthemselves by day.  One, ten, a hundred, each alone, they come andgo: vague, inhuman.  And then, reluctantly, the hesitant dawn creepsshivering out of the East River, and the weary day begins again.Into this street--into its noisiest quarter at its noisiest time--thecab that bore Violet on her way to liberty at last turned andproceeded as far under the flaring gasoline torches as the eveningcrowd of workers, buyers, and sellers, would permit.  The girl,through the dark thoroughfares that had preceded it, had answered ascore of questions, which Dyker had asked her, the fever of escapebeating high in her breast and tossing ready replies to her heatedlips; but now, in the roar and brilliance of Rivington Street\\'snocturnal traffic, there had come upon her a terror almost equal tothat which had assailed her when, with Max for her guide, the lightedlength of East Fourteenth Street had first unrolled itself beforeher.  The city was again an inimical monster awaiting her descentfrom the cab, and the newly acquired habit of seclusion, the habit ofthe prisoner, recoiled upon her.  Freedom was strange; it becameawesome, and when the horse was stopped and Violet knew that she mustsoon fare alone, she cowered in a corner, breathing hard.\"Can\\'t go no furder, boss,\" said the cabby, leaning far around fromhis seat.  \"Where to now?\"\"Nowhere right away,\" answered Dyker.  \"Just stand where you are fora minute.\"Then he turned to Violet.\"Now,\" he said, not unkindly, \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to drop you here.It wouldn\\'t do for me to figure publicly as an active agent in thiscase, you know.  But you needn\\'t worry.  Just get out and walk to thenext corner.  Turn to your right, take the next cross-street to yourleft, go up the first narrow street you come to, and your friend\\'shouse ought to be about the third in the row.  It will be a littledark, but you won\\'t have any trouble finding it.\"Violet hesitated.\"I hope I won\\'t,\" she said.\"Surely not.  If you have, just ask the way of the first policemanyou see.\"\"Not a policeman, Mr. Dyker!\"\"Of course, a policeman.  He won\\'t hurt you as long as you keep yourcloak tight.  Now, you\\'re sure you\\'ve given me the right address?\"\"I gave you the one the man gave me.\"\"Yes, but I mean you\\'re not lying to me?\"Violet\\'s wide eyes should have been sufficient denial.\"Why would I do that?\" she asked.\"That\\'s so; only I thought--well, I beg your pardon, Violet.  Youhave my office-address on that card.  I\\'ll send for you in a day ortwo--be sure to be home every afternoon--and then we\\'ll fix MadameRose with the District-Attorney.--Good-by.  Sure you\\'re not afraid?\"Her gratitude would not permit her to acknowledge fear.\"Not afraid,\" she smiled, rather grimly.\"Then remember: the first street to your right, the next to yourleft, and then to your right again--third or fourth house in the row.\"He opened the cab-door and alighted, holding out his hand.She straightened her beaver hat, drew the folds of her dark cloaktightly over the betraying crimson of her kimona, and, helped by hisgrasp, followed him to the swarming curb.\"I--I don\\'t know how to thank you,\" she said.\"Then don\\'t try,\" returned Dyker, laughing easily.  \"You can make itall right with me when you testify against Rose.\"She kept his hand a moment longer, partly in fear of the humanmultitude about her and partly in genuine gratitude.\"But I do thank you,\" she said.Dyker, not too well liking the white light of publicity in which thislittle scene was being enacted, pressed her hand and dropped it.\"That\\'s all right,\" he responded.  \"Just don\\'t forget your promise.\"He stepped back into the cab.  \"Good-by, and good luck,\" he said.\"Good-by,\" he heard her answer, and then, with his head out of thecab-window, he saw her pause bewilderedly.  \"To your right,\" hecautioned.He watched her turn.  He saw her plunge into the crowd.  He saw thecrowd swallow her up.\"Take me over to my office,\" he ordered the driver, and added hisaddress.Once there, he dismissed the cab, climbed the steps of what seemed anold and modest little house, and, opening the door and turning intothe front room, lit a gas-jet the flame of which revealed anapartment surprisingly new and arrogant.  The walls were lined withnew bookcases holding rows of new law-books, and surrounded by rowsof new chairs.  The flat-top desk in the center, at which hisstenographer sat by daylight, was a new desk, with new wire-basketsupon it, and a new telephone, to which Dyker now immediatelyproceeded and called a number.\"Hello,\" he said into the transmitter, adopting the low tone that healways used in his wired conversations.  \"Is that Schleger\\'s?--Itis?--That you, Ludwig?--This is Dyker.--Yes, good-evening,Ludwig.--Yes, pretty good, thank you.  How are you, and how\\'sbusiness?--That\\'s good.  Mrs. Schleger and the babies allright?--I\\'ll bet that boy\\'s gained three pounds!--He has?  I\\'m gladto hear it.  You\\'re a wonder.--Yes.--That\\'s what I said.  And, say,Ludwig, is O\\'Malley anywhere around?--He isn\\'t?--Hasn\\'t been in thisevening?--Oh!  Well, I wonder where I can find him.--You don\\'t?Perhaps he\\'s at Dugan\\'s place.--No, it\\'s not anything important: Ijust wanted to take a drink with him, that\\'s all.  He\\'s sure to be atDugan\\'s or Venturio\\'s, but I guess I won\\'t bother.  Ever so muchobliged, Ludwig.--Good-by.\"In spite of his word, Dyker did, however, bother.  He called threeother numbers in his quest of the political boss, and when he foundhim, the underling made a pressing appointment for an importantconference on the next morning, though what it was that he wantedthen to discuss he carefully neglected to mention over atelephone-wire.He hung up the receiver in a glow of satisfaction.\"And now,\" he said, \"I think I\\'ll get away for the night.  I don\\'tcare to have any arguments with Rose for a day or two.\"Yet, even as he said it, the telephone-bell uttered its staccatosummons.  He stood uncertainly beside the desk.\"She wouldn\\'t have the nerve to use the wire,\" he argued.  \"Perhapsit\\'s O\\'Malley with more to say.\"Again the bell rang, and his curiosity overcame his caution.  He tookup the receiver.\"Hello!\" he said sharply, and then his tone mellowed, for the voicethat came to him across the hurrying New York night was the voice ofMarian Lennox.\"Is that Mr. Dyker\\'s office?\" it asked.\"It is the head of the firm himself,\" he answered, \"and mighty gladto hear from you.\"\"I am glad you\\'re glad,\" the voice pursued, \"because I want to ask afavor.\"\"It is as good as performed.  What is it?\"\"I have been down town, and remained longer than I intended, and Iwant you, please, to take me home.\"\"I thought you were asking a favor, not bestowing one.  Where areyou?\"\"At the settlement.\"\"In Rivington Street?\"  Wesley set his teeth as he asked it.\"Yes.\"\"Very well, I\\'ll be over right away.\"He rang off and left the office.  He was sorry that he had dismissedthe cab, for he expected to need it when he reached the first stageof his journey; but the way was not long to the place that Marian hadnamed, and, even had it been twice as far to the settlement, Dyker,who walked thither with the feet of chagrin, would not have remarkedthe distance.In the midst of Rivington Street, in a house that used, long ago, tobe a Methodist parsonage, a little group of devoted women are doingtheir best to redeem, by social activities, the people of theneighborhood from the benighted condition in which the people\\'s lotis cast.  This best has now been done for more years than a few, andthe people, still considering it necessary to remain alive, and stillknowing that to remain alive they must submit to the economic systemimposed upon them, continue discouragingly unredeemed.  But thedevoted women, though they neglect the disease for its symptoms,persist as only feminine natures can persist.They are college-bred women with the limitations and emancipations oftheir class; and they have a great deal to occupy their attentionbesides their essays in social entertainment.  For the most part theypass their days in really practical investigation.  One of them willinspect the public schools and impartially consider curricula andventilation.  Another will visit tenements and ask housewivespersonal questions for the tabular benefit of the Russell SageFoundation.  A third goes into the laundries of the best hotels andfinds that these hostelries force their washerwomen to sleep twentyin a room.  Yet, when they return to Rivington Street, these daylightinvestigators spur their wearied nerves to further exertion and goforward, not to teach the toilers the practical cause and remedy ofthe economic evil, but to form the boys and girls, the young womenand young men, into reading groups, debating clubs, sewing circles,cooking classes, and elocutionary juntas.  Their zeal is boundless,their martyrdom sadly genuine, and, if there is humor, there issomething more than humor in their ultimate complaint:\"Some of our people we retain, but most of them slip away, and, evenwith the best of fortune, we seem, somehow, able to do so little.\"Dyker knew the place by reputation.  He had always scorned it for itsown sake, and now he had come to hate it for Marian\\'s.  For want of abetter term, it may be repeated that he was in love with Marian.Moreover, he wished the assistance that an early marriage with thedaughter of a wealthy department-store owner would give him in thecoming campaign.  And, finally, his peculiar legal activities werealready well enough known on the East Side to make it probable thatany young woman entering the settlement would speedily learn of them.After the night of the opera his cooler reflection had rejectedMarian\\'s plan of joining the Rivington Street colony as a ferventlygirlish dream destined to fade before the reality of action.  He haddecided that the best way to aid its dissipation was no longer tocombat it, and he had even, during the months that had followed, seenMarian but rarely, and never alone.  Occupied with politics andknowing the tactical value of restraint, he had not so much aspressed his wooing.  He had relied upon what he chose to describe ashis sweetheart\\'s basic commonsense to work out their commonsalvation, and had decided that, this commonsense being what heesteemed it, Marian was a woman more likely to be won by a Fabiancampaign than by a Varric attack.The point wherein these calculations erred was their underestimationof the momentum of a girlish impulse.  That method of considerationwhich makes one slow to reach convictions works beyond theconvictions and retards one from action upon them, once they areachieved, but the impulsive mind that bolts a creed unmasticatedstraightway drives its owner, in the creed\\'s behalf, to thethumbscrews or the wrack.  It is from the pods of half-baked opinionsthat there is shaken the seed of the church: Marian meant to keep toher purpose.Perhaps Wesley\\'s silence and the subtle sense of pique that itawakened played a part in this; perhaps the purpose wasself-sufficient; but, in either case, Marian missed scarcely anevening at the settlement.  Two of her former classmates wereknee-deep in the work there, and what she saw and what they told herserved only to confirm her.  It thus happened that, anxious again tosee him alone, and more anxious to let him know the endurance of herresolution, she had, on this evening, telephoned on the chance offinding him late at his office.\"Good heavens!\" he gasped as she met him at the settlement\\'s door.\"What on earth are you doing in this part of town at this hour of thenight?  Let me \\'phone for a taxi.\"What, as a matter of fact, she had been doing was to listen to slimlittle Luigi Malatesta and fat little Morris Binderwitz respectivelyattacking and defending the proposition that Abraham Lincoln was agreater American than George Washington; but what she thought she hadbeen doing was assisting in raising the lower half of society.  Underthis impression, her fine brown eyes shone with the consciousness ofmoral rectitude, her mouth was even more than usually firm, and herhead even more than usually like some delicate cameo.\"One thing at a time, please,\" she imperturbably answered.  \"First,no taxicab.  It isn\\'t far to Second Avenue, which is quiet enough,and I want to walk for a few blocks.\"She took the arm that he grimly offered, and he began to break hisway through the noisy crowd under the flaring gasoline lamps of thepush-carts.  Coherent conversation was at first impossible, but Dykerfelt a glow of pride as, with her fingers closed in tight trust uponhim, he shouldered a passage for her, and Marian herself was notinsusceptible to the thrill inherent in the situation.  Nevertheless,the girl, as soon as they had turned northward, reverted to herformer attitude; and the man, knowing well that all this meant thatshe was still determined upon a course necessarily delaying hiswooing and perhaps resulting in his discovery, frankly resumed hisopposition.  He did more and worse: he swept aside all his method ofsilence, all his plans of conquest through non-resistance.\"Now,\" he said, continuing their interrupted talk, \"I should reallylike to know what you, of all people in the world, were doing onRivington Street.\"\"I was there,\" she announced serenely, \"because I have made up mymind that it is I, of all people in the world, who ought to be there.\"\"Marian,\"--he almost stopped as he said it--\"are you really inearnest about this fancy?  Do you honestly mean that you areseriously considering any such chimerical course?\"He had, naturally, chosen precisely the tone that, were anyadditional incentive required, would have compelled her toresolution.  Her mind, as it chanced, was, however, made up, and whathe now said served only to turn her toward that feminine logic whichassumes as done that which is determined.\"I am past consideration,\" she said.  \"I have already virtuallybegun.\"\"Marian!  You\\'re joking.\"\"I am simply stating a fact.  Why do you suppose I have been stayingin town this summer?  I begin my real work at the settlement with thefirst of next week.\"Her classmates in Rivington Street, could they have heard this, wouldhave been pleased, but they would also have been surprised.Nevertheless, she at once mentally decided to make good herdeclaration.In the darkness Dyker bit the lip that, under his short, crispmustache, trembled with vexation.\"You really mean that?\"She bowed a brief assent.\"Then what, if you please, do you propose to do when you get there?\"As to that Marian found herself suddenly certain.\"You ought to know,\" she said, \"how these people are living; youought to know how the girls--hundreds and hundreds of them--are everyweek going into lives of shame and death.  I mean to do what I can tostop them.\"It would have been a hard thing for her to say to him had he notwrought upon her anger, and had not the freshness of her partialglimpse of earth\\'s lower seven-eighths fired her heart with a blindinspiration.  She had the partial vision that makes the martyr: avision that shows just enough of an evil to confirm the necessity ofaction and not enough to prove how little individual actionindividually directed can be worth.For the second time Wesley gasped.  Here were depths in her of whichhe had not dreamed, and because he had not dreamed of them he wouldnot admit them.\"But you can\\'t!\" he protested.  \"It is impossible that you should.It\\'s inconceivable that a woman of your delicacy should go into suchcoarse work!\"\"Is it better that it should be left to coarse women?  It seems to methat there has been enough of coarseness in it already.\"\"But this--why, it\\'s something that one can\\'t even speak about!\"\"Yes, something that we are not permitted even to mention, Wesley;and because we aren\\'t permitted even to mention it, the thing growsand grows, night by night.  It thrives in the shadow of our silence.They tell me that the liquor laws are broken, because nobody willmention it; that bestial men get rich in it, because nobody willmention it; that in this city alone there are three hundred saloondance-halls intended to furnish its supply, because nobody willmention it!\"Figuratively, Dyker threw up his hands in horror, but actually, likeall desperate men, he seized at the straws of detail.\"Now, that just shows how wrong your view of the whole subjecthappens to be,\" he declared.  \"My work has put me in a position toknow something about these dance-halls, and I know that they existsimply because the girls that go to them want them to exist--thegirls, mark you; not the men.  Why, the girls aren\\'t taken to suchplaces; they go of themselves, they pay their own admission, and itis the usual thing for a girl earning six dollars a week in a storeto save fifty cents out of every salary-envelope for the dance-halls.\"\"Then you want me to conclude that the fact that they want to do thething makes the thing right?\"\"You don\\'t understand----\"\"Precisely; and so I mean to learn.\"\"You can\\'t learn.  No matter how closely you study this whole matter,you can\\'t learn, Marian.  How can a clean-hearted, clean-livedAmerican girl ever get the point of view of these low-down,low-browed foreigners?  It\\'s the sort of thing they\\'re used to.\"\"Before they begin it?\"\"It\\'s the survival of the fittest.\"\"Then can\\'t some be made more fit to survive?\"\"It\\'s the law of life, and it can\\'t be stopped.\"\"So was negro slavery the law of life.  It couldn\\'t be stoppedeither--until we stopped it.\"\"That is all theory, Marian; it won\\'t work out in practice.  Thegreat point is that these unfortunate women, whether they becomeunfortunate through the dance-halls or anywhere else, are simply notour sort of clay: they\\'re not Americans.\"\"They are human beings.\"\"A pretty low example.\"\"And they are more Americans than your ancestors or mine were threehundred years ago.\"\"Nonsense.  They\\'re different, I tell you--different.  Seriously, Iknow what I am talking about: I speak from systematic investigations,reports, statistics.  The very latest investigation shows that allbut about thirteen per cent. of these women were either born abroador else are the children of foreign parents.  It is always the newestimmigrants that swell the ranks, and of course the newest immigrantsare our lowest type.\"\"I don\\'t see that all this alters the question.\"\"Well, it does.\"\"The lower they are, the more plainly it is our duty to raise them.\"\"My dear Marian, how can you raise them when you don\\'t understandthem?\"Marian shook her handsome head.\"You _will_ come back to that,\" she said; \"and all that I can answeris that, not being utterly stupid, and having come to understand afew abstract problems, I have hopes of mastering something so closeat hand to me and so concrete as a fellow human being.\"\"What, for instance?\" asked Wesley, \"can you understand of thetypical Jewish girl of the East Side?\"\"A good deal, I think.  They were talking about that type at thesettlement this evening.  We were looking from the front windows atan endless stream of Jewish girls tramping home from the factorieswhere they worked to the tenements where they slept.  Somebody saidthere are nearly four hundred thousand Jews living east of theBowery; that in most Jewish families the ambition to which everycomfort must be sacrificed is the education of the boys; that forthis reason the girls must work and are worked until there is nowhereelse in the world where so much labor is got out of young women, andyet that the Jewess that is not married and a mother before she istwenty is regarded as a family disgrace.  It seems to me, Wesley,that the case of those girls is pretty easy to understand.  It seemsto me that they are on the horns of a rather ugly dilemma.\"Dyker\\'s cane whipped the air as if it were striking at the heads ofopposing arguments.\"You accept as gospel,\" he said, \"everything that is told you byanybody but me.  It isn\\'t a pleasant subject, but, if you insist uponfacts, let me tell you that there are troops of Jewesses who comedown here from the upper Ghetto and walk the streets for no otherpurpose than to get money for their wedding trousseaus.\"It was a blow at her conventions, and she shuddered; but she stood byher guns.  They had crossed down Twenty-sixth Street now and theyturned into the quiet of Madison Avenue, among comfortable houses andsilent churches, as she answered.\"If they do that,\" she said, \"it is because they have to.\"\"Have to?  Why on earth should they have to?\"\"I don\\'t know, but I know that the very use they make of the moneyshows what they do is only a means and not an end.\"\"Are trousseaus so necessary that these girls have to sell theirsouls for them?\"\"Souls have been sold for less.  Even you and I make considerablesacrifices for things that other people in other classes would notthink needful at all.\"He had done his best to bridle his annoyance, but now he could bridleit no longer.  He was wholly sincere in his inability to takeseriously either the girl or her point of view, and now, though hefelt as if he were riding a hunter at a butterfly, he charged blindly.\"Oh, please don\\'t let us jump at sentiment and theory,\" heremonstrated; \"let us keep our feet on figures and fact.  The figuresgrow with the population; they always have so grown and they alwayswill so grow.  And the plain fact is that, though a few good peoplehave been trying to stop this thing for four thousand years, theyhave never succeeded in doing anything but soiling themselves in theattempt.\"\"I know that,\" she frankly acknowledged, \"and I don\\'t know what it isthat\\'s to blame; but I know that there isn\\'t any evil that hasn\\'tsome cure if we can only find it out.\"\"Then why not leave the search for a cure to the experienced?\"\"I shall; but I propose to become one of the experienced.  I mean togive my time, at least for a while, to first-hand study.  Perhapsthen I shall learn enough to know that it\\'s useless for me to go on,but I shall keep trying to go on until I am convinced that thereisn\\'t any use in the trying.\"\"That\\'s absurd, Marian--simply absurd.  The condition is, after all,one that must be dealt with by the law, and I tell you honestly that,as yet, even the law is helpless.\"\"Has the law really tried?  Has it ever attempted, for instance, todo anything to the men that take these immigrant girls at the dockand make slaves of them?\"\"Yes, it has; it has tried just that.  In Chicago two men werearrested for taking a couple of such girls--they had brought themfrom New York--and when the case was appealed, the United StatesSupreme Court found that, though importation of girls was a violationof federal law, yet the federal law providing a punishment for merely_harboring_ such girls after their arrival was unconstitutional.\"Marian\\'s voice faltered.\"Is--is that true?\" she asked.\"Absolutely,\" said Dyker.  Like most lawyers of his generation, hisideas of what was right were limited only by the final decisions ofwhat was legal, and if the Supreme Court of the United States had, byeven a majority of one, declared that the sun moved around the earth,Dyker would have first denied and then forgotten all previousastronomy.\"Absolutely,\" he repeated, and awaited her capitulation.But Marian did not capitulate.  She merely drew a long breath andanswered:\"After all, that, of course, is just a small portion of the bigquestion, and the only way it moves me is to lessen my opinion of theSupreme Court.\"It was Wesley\\'s turn to gasp, and he did so.  He had always suspectedthat these college-settlements were hotbeds of Socialism andAnarchy--two theories that, to Dyker, were one and the same--and nowhe had his confirmation.He was too cynically wrong upon one side of their subject to realizehow emotionally wrong she, in her hope of accomplishment throughpersonal appeal, might be upon the other.  But here was a concretedenial of his one sincere conviction, and, though he was at last calmenough to see that he must not allow this conviction to wreck hissuit, he was not so calm as to maintain a clear judgment.  It wasplain that Marian would not be turned from her experiment.  His bestcourse was, he then reasoned, immediately to put on record hisopinion of its futility, even to quarrel with her in defense of thatopinion, and then, when experience brought the awakening upon whichhis own worldly experience counted, to stand ready to profit by theinevitable reaction that would most likely show the perfidy of thewomen whom Marian hoped to help, detract from the credibility of anygossip they might recount concerning him, and end by winning him hiswife.\"All right,\" he said sharply, \"it is perfectly useless to talkreasonably to anybody that can take such a view of so simple amatter.  Here is Thirty-fourth Street.  I think we had better walkover to Broadway and get that taxi.\"The worst thing that a man can impute to a handsome woman is a lackof intellect.  Marian\\'s cheeks flushed.\"I quite agree with you,\" she replied.  \"I am utterly incapable ofarguing with anybody that so confuses law and justice.\"\"Very well,\" said Dyker; \"but I want you to remember what I have saidupon the subject as a whole.  When you have trusted these women andbeen betrayed by them, when they have poisoned your mind against allthe principles you have been brought up to believe, when you haveleft the world of sentiment and bruised your poor hands withhammering at the door of fact, then you will acknowledge that I havebeen right.  I am not angry----\"\"Oh, of course not!\"\"I am not angry, but I am firm.  I only ask you to believe that Ishall never be far away from the settlement, and that you have onlyto telephone for me when you have need of me.\"Marian compressed her lips to a more severe firmness, and the ridefrom Thirty-fourth Street to Riverside Drive was made in silence; butthe following Monday found her, against all parental protests,enlisted as a settlement-worker in Rivington Street.XVIMPARTIAL JUSTICEMichael M. O\\'Malley, political boss, held his court, that nextmorning, in the back room of Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon on SecondAvenue, and, because it was to be a busy day and there were manypleas to be made and many petitions to be received, he came early tohis post.As he swung majestically up the street toward his destination, hiscarefully pressed light gray suit flapping in the warm breeze about afigure so tall and so thin that any suit approaching \"a fit\" wouldhave achieved only a caricature, his progress was almost regal.Pedestrians stepped to one side as if the bulk of his unseen dignitydemanded a far wider strip of the paved channel than was required byhis visible physique.  Workingmen touched their grimy caps, theoverseers of the street-repairing gangs bowed respectfully, childrenon their way to school bobbed their heads, and, at a corner, OfficerRiley, concluding a substitute week \"on the day turn,\" offered hisbest military salute.  The keeper of every news-stand received a nod;the bootblacks outside of each saloon were given a brief word ofgreeting; there was not a beggar but got some largess, and of theseveral men that hurried up with a request, hinted or expressed, allwere permitted to walk a few steps in the august presence, allreceived a brief, civil phrase of agreement, postponement, orconsideration.\"Trouble about your place?\"  It was thus that O\\'Malley interruptedthe voluble plea of a saloon-keeper that approached him.  \"I\\'ll havethat cop, Conners, looked into.  His eyes are too new; they seemore\\'n they\\'re paid to see.  Who\\'s tendin\\' day-bar for you?  JohnnyMager?  All right, if they take the thing up front, I\\'ll see that youget your license transferred in his name.  Keep your shirt on an\\'leave it to me.\"He had not paused in his walk; he had not raised his quiet voice orquickened his slow speech; but the suppliant retired satisfied,reassured.Indeed, O\\'Malley\\'s face was one that, if it would not inspireconfidence in a stranger unacquainted with the man\\'s reputation forguarding the interests of his dependents, at least bore theunmistakable stamp of that knowledge of life which is power.  It wassallow and long, with a long thin nose and long thin lips, and coldeyes that thrust as swiftly and as deeply as the stilettos of Mr.O\\'Malley\\'s Italian constituents.  He smiled often and his smile wasbitter; he spoke little and his words were short; but his servantshad early learned that he was as sure to keep his promise as he wasready to give it, and that, so long as his tasks were well done, hewas an indulgent master.He entered \"Schleger\\'s place\" with the air of an owner, nodded to thewhite-jacketed man behind the polished counter and before thepolished mirror, and gave a quick, firm pressure to the plump,outstretched hand of the fat and grinning proprietor.\"All well with the family?\" he asked, smiling his wry smile.Ludwig Schleger beamed assent.\"Anything doing last night?\"\"Nothin\\',\" replied Ludwig.  \"\\'Ceptin\\' Mr. Dyker called you on thetelephone.  Wouldn\\'t say what he wanted.\"\"I know that.  Haven\\'t had any more roughhousing?\"\"No,\" grinned Schleger, wisely; \"the boys are all got wise that theycan\\'t meddle with my new night-man.\"\"I see.  Name\\'s Hermann Hoffmann, ain\\'t it?\"\"That\\'s right.\"\"Hum.  Well, he may be useful.  You must get him to move into thisprecinct, or else register him from here.  Votes right, of course?\"\"I ain\\'t asked him yet.\"\"Do it to-night.\"O\\'Malley walked to the dimly lighted back-room, hung with racingprints and framed lithographs advertising a wide variety of whiskeys.He drew a wicker-bottomed chair to a stained round table, and satdown.The proprietor brought him a glass and a syphon of seltzer--theboss\\'s only drink--and disappeared.  The bar-keeper came with ahandful of black cigars for which O\\'Malley paid with a bill, refusingthe change, and also disappeared.  Then the door of communication wasshut and guarded, admission being denied to all persons not properlyaccredited, and the quiet, thin man in the light gray suit, nowsipping his seltzer, now reflectively adjusting his bright blue tie,which bore a brilliant diamond pin, and always slowly smoking, beganhis conference with such callers as he had granted appointments.They came in force--alone and in groups--all manner of men by themain entrance and a woman or two ushered through a side door.  Thisone was promised a reward for duty to be done, that one assigned tothe performance of a delicate piece of diplomacy.  Now and then ashort, sharp, cold reprimand for negligence or failure sent away acaller whipped, penitent, trembling; and here and there release waspromised for a wayward son sent to \"The Island,\" or a line of creditwritten for use at a grocer\\'s shop.Wesley Dyker came early.  He paused at the bar for a drink to stiffenhis courage, lingered a little longer until a predecessor had beendismissed, and then, his lids lowered, entered, alone, with asuccinct account of Rose\\'s attempt to play a double game.When he had finished the narrative, O\\'Malley sat for a while gazingunconcernedly at the blackened ceiling, and smoking quietly.\"Well?\" he said at last, and turned the sharp thrust of his gaze uponhis caller.Dyker, who was sitting opposite and who had been served with a drinkof whiskey, tossed off the liquor in order to gain time to muster ananswer for this unexpected query.\"Well,\" he at length replied, annoyed at thus being put into aposition where he must make his proposition in the form of a request,\"are you going to stand for that sort of thing?\"\"I dunno.\"\"_I_ wouldn\\'t stand for it,\" said Dyker.\"If you had my job you might have to.\"There was another pause.  The long fingers of O\\'Malley tapped gentlyon the table.  Dyker shifted uneasily in his seat.\"I wouldn\\'t stand for it a minute!\" he at last broke forth.  \"Andwhat\\'s more, you can have her up for something worse than thedisorderly-house charge.  She has one kidnapped girl in her housenow, and I\\'ve got another that escaped from her, and who\\'s ready totestify.\"An instant later he was sorry that he had spoken so readily.O\\'Malley tilted back against the wall until the front legs of hischair rose six inches from the floor.  He blew an easy ring of smoke.\"You seem to have come here with your case all prepared,\" he remarked.Wesley flushed and stammered.\"You see,\" he began, \"I mean that I got hot at this, and I said tomyself that it was only right to let you know this woman wasn\\'t to bedepended upon.\"The forward legs of O\\'Malley\\'s chair came down with a loud thump.Wesley started, but the boss only impaled him with another coldglance.\"See here,\" said he, \"before we can do business we\\'d betteraltogether understand each other.  Just what is it you want?\"\"I--I think I\\'ve made that clear.\"\"_I_ think not.\"\"I want this Légère woman pinched for running a white-slave place.  Iwant to see her taught a lesson that the other women down her waywill profit by.\"\"Of course you do.  But what do you want for yourself?\"The issue was too conclusively joined to permit of further evasion.Wesley took his courage in his hands.\"Why, I\\'ve not made any secret of that,\" he said, \"and neither hasheadquarters.  I want the next election for magistrate.  I told youthat long ago.\"He launched his declaration with the bravado of weakness at bay, andthen breathlessly awaited the answer.Michael O\\'Malley leaned back again in his chair, clasped his handsbehind his head, and closed his keen eyes, reflecting.His was an hereditary office, but, unlike most men that inheritpower, he had inherited also the abilities that had gained the power.His father, who had begun life as a policeman, had been a greatexemplar of the political uses of an element fully realized only bythe expert politician: the human element.  The name of O\\'Malley hadnow for a generation been, south of Fourteenth Street, a magic title.To a legion of men, women, and children, it stood for a sort ofsubstitute, and very near and practical, Providence.  It impliedcontact, fellow-feeling, the personal relation.  Acting upon thepolitician\\'s axiom that whatever is acquired is right, the elderO\\'Malley had risen from the street force until, after zealousparty-work, he had been promoted, in the palmy days of policy and thepool-rooms, to the \"Gambling Squad,\" where he had performed theastounding financial feat of saving eight times his monthly salary,had retired, and grown annually richer and stronger through politics,without once losing the esteem of his voting underlings, or onceseeming to cease being one of them.  Since his father\\'s death, nowthat gambling had declined and prostitution had risen as politicalmaterial, Michael, who had been brought up to the business, hadfilled the place of that genuinely mourned parent.  Without anypublicly acknowledged means of support, even with no headquarterssave the daily shifted back-rooms of saloons, he had extended andincreased the power and the fortune that had been left to him.  Hewas known as the friend of the distressed; he was recognized asbenefiting with his left hand the poor whom he unimpededly robbedwith his right.  To those who were without money or withoutassistance he was always accessible.  He made festival with the merryand was readily sympathetic with them that mourned.  By small giftsat all times and large gifts in days of emergency, by acting as theadviser, the employment-agent, the defender, from the law, of thepeople whom he exploited and upon whose weaknesses and vices hethrove, he won and held fast both the tribute and the allegiance ofthe vicious and the weak.It was a mighty position and yet one that, in moments like thepresent, was inherently delicate, one in which the fortunate man mustmove warily lest in gaining a new friend he lose an old.  It is allvery well to be temperate and profit by drunkenness, to be abstemiousand take money from prostitution; it is easy to give presents atChristmas and picnics in summer when the giving is in reality onlypaying a small rebate to wives for drunken husbands, to mothers fordaughters stolen.  It is easy to find a place in the municipalgovernment for the man that stuffs a ballot-box for you, or theprocurer that registers your fraudulent votes from the houses of hiscustomers; but it is fatal to punish, for what may be a passingdisloyalty, anyone that your world, perhaps ignorant that offense hasbeen committed, regards as having been placed by a careless Heavenunder your protecting wing,--fatal, that is to say, unless youacquire something more than you throw away.Of all this, though scarcely with such frankness of phrase, MichaelO\\'Malley made thought before he gave Dyker the reply for which thatclever young lawyer was waiting.  Behind his closed eyes he weighedthe chances carefully: the things to be gained against the thingsthat might be lost.Then he thoughtfully lit another black cigar.\"You\\'ve got to keep out of personal relations with these women,\" heyawned.Dyker bit his lip.\"I don\\'t have them,\" he replied.\"Yes, you do.  Cut \\'em out.  Understand?\"Surprisedly, angrily, Dyker found himself bowing obedience, like aschool-urchin detected in some breach of academic discipline.\"A woman with a past,\" continued O\\'Malley, \"is all right for thepresent, but a slow mare in the futurity.\"\"I dare say you\\'re correct,\" said Wesley Dyker.  With a single blowof the whip, the master had demonstrated his mastery.O\\'Malley smoked a while longer in silence.\"Now then,\" he at last pursued, \"about this magistracy.  You thinkthe boys\\'ll stand for you?\"\"I think they will,\" Wesley replied, with humble mien, but risingassurance.  \"And I think it ought to make the ticket look better tothe uptown people to have--if you will pardon my saying so--my sortof name on it.\"O\\'Malley grunted.\"Don\\'t you worry about the looks of the ticket, or the value of yoursort of a name,\" he said.  \"The kid-glove game is played out; it\\'sonly the monkey who\\'s always hopping about on his family-tree.\"Dyker\\'s courage ebbed again, but he knew that to stand upon hisdignity was to be overthrown.\"At all events,\" he persisted, \"I am pretty well known hereabouts bythis time, and I think honestly that I am pretty well liked.\"O\\'Malley nodded.  He knew more about that than Dyker knew.  Dykerhad, with more or less direct assistance from O\\'Malley\\'s ownheadquarters, already won some prominence for himself, and had beenof some use to the organization, in that sort of legal-practice whichis a highly specialized branch of the profession on the lower EastSide.  The purpose of that branch is simply the protection of thecriminal, especially the criminal engaged in the procuring orconfining of slave-girls, but its methods, far from being unusual,are merely a daring extension of the methods that, within the lastdecade, have increased in popularity among the seemingly morerespectable practitioners.  Evidence is manufactured or destroyed,according to immediate needs; favorable witnesses are taughtfavorable testimony; postponements are secured until a politicallyindebted judge is on the bench.  There follows a formal bellowingagainst what are called invasions of inalienable personal rights, andthen there comes a matter-of-course acquittal.  With Dyker\\'s abilityin this sort of work O\\'Malley was thoroughly familiar; for this man\\'sparty-services he was sufficiently grateful, and with the chance ofthe lawyer\\'s rise to a popularity that would be of still further helphe was well satisfied.\"If you\\'d be elected,\" he at length reflectively remarked, \"you\\'dhave a mighty responsible position, Dyker.\"\"I know that.\"\"There would be a good many ways\"--O\\'Malley knocked, with greatdeliberation, the ash from his cigar--\"a good many ways in which youcould help the party--if you\\'d be elected.\"He seemed to be discussing, disinterestedly, a purely abstractquestion; but Dyker did not miss his meaning.\"I shouldn\\'t overlook them,\" he said.\"And, _if you\\'d be elected_, there\\'d be a lot of ways in which youmight hurt--the party.\"\"I scarcely think you have any just cause for apprehension upon thatscore, Mr. O\\'Malley.  I think that my record speaks for itself.  Myrecord is regular; it is an open book to the whole city----\"\"Never mind that, Dyker; it\\'s an open book to me, anyhow.\"\"I\\'m aware of it; but then----\"\"All I want to know is two things.\"\"And they are, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\"First, are you the kind that lose their head over a good thing andland in jail?\"\"Does my law-practice seem to indicate that I should be likely tooverstep legal limits?\"\"No, I guess it don\\'t.  But you can\\'t always tell; we can\\'t afford nohogs; and that sort of a man gives all his friends a black eye.\"\"But I say to you----\"\"And next, I want to know, Mr. Dyker, whether you\\'re the kind of aman that don\\'t forget them that put him where he\\'s at.\"The low, slow spoken sentence ended with a sudden click of Mr.O\\'Malley\\'s long, vulpine jaws.  He leaned quickly forward across thetable and fixed Wesley with the stiletto of his eyes.Dyker met that gaze steadily.  He leaned, in his turn, towardO\\'Malley, and his own voice dropped to a whisper.  There was anexchange of a dozen sentences, and the two men had arrived at aperfect understanding: Dyker was as good as elected.O\\'Malley pressed the call-button.\"Billy,\" he said to the bar-keeper, \"have somebody run out and bringin Larry Riley off his beat.  I want to see him.\"As the bar-keeper nodded and disappeared, Dyker started to rise.\"I don\\'t know whether Riley had better see me here,\" he said.\"Rose\\'s house is on his regular beat.\"\"All the more reason to sit tight,\" replied the comprehendingO\\'Malley.  \"What\\'s the use of gettin\\' square with a person unless theperson knows who done it?\"\"But I am not sure that Riley would be a safe man to confide this to.He\\'s naturally a friend of Rose\\'s.\"\"He\\'s more of a friend of mine.\"The officer entered a minute later, his flushed face gravelyattentive, his helmet in his hand.\"Riley,\" said O\\'Malley, \"you know this Légère woman.\"\"I do that, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir.\"\"Well, she\\'s been gettin\\' too gay.  When you go off duty, you tellJim to have her place pinched to-night.\"Riley\\'s cheeks became a shade less red.\"It\\'s sorry I am to hear, sir, that she\\'s been misbehavin\\' ofherself,\" he murmured.\"Sure you\\'re sorry.  Tell Jim to get there early: we don\\'t wantnobody but the women.\"\"What\"--Riley wet his dry lips--\"What\\'s the charge?\"\"Runnin\\' a white-slave joint.  You\\'re to be sure to get a girl shehas in the third floor back.\"O\\'Malley\\'s tone had been conclusive; it indicated that the interviewwas at an end; but the big officer stood twirling his helmet betweenhis large hands.\"Mr. O\\'Malley, sir?\" he began.\"What is it, Riley?\"\"There\\'s nothin\\' else?\"\"Nuthin\\'.\"\"An\\'--there ain\\'t no other way out of it for Mrs. Légère?\"\"No, there ain\\'t.  But you can report her house and get the credityourself, Riley.\"\"Thank ye kindly, sir; but if ye don\\'t mind, sir, I think I\\'d ratherlet someone get it as nades it more.  Ye see, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir, thishere Mrs. Légère has been powerful kind to me, an\\'----\"\"All right, have it your own way.\"\"I--I can\\'t do nothin\\' for her, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\"Not this time.  That\\'s all, Riley.--And, Riley----\"The thin boss stood up and crossed to the bulky policeman.  His voicewas still low and soft.\"Yis, Mr. O\\'Malley?\"\"If that woman gets wind of this an\\' makes a getaway, I\\'ll have youruniform off you so God damned quick you\\'ll wish I\\'d skinned youalive.\"\"Yis, Mr. O\\'Malley, sir,\" said the officer.  \"No fear of that, sir.\"But he left the audience-chamber with a heavy heart.  He lived thelife that he was compelled to live, and he did what he was ordered todo, but he could not without compunction turn upon one that hadbought a right to his own and his superior\\'s protection.There was not a little silent bitterness in his heart as, later,returning to the station-house, he thought upon these things.  Heremembered the days when he had been new upon the force.  Those werethe days when the popular tide had turned against gambling and, amidthe raids that meant the breaking of steel doors, the pursuit ofoffenders through secret passages and across steep roofs, it was fora while possible for a policeman to retain his ideals.  But heremembered also how, when the ruling powers had thus been forced todestroy the nests where once they had gathered golden eggs, the longarm of necessity swung slowly backward until it paused at the pointwhere it had since remained and, because the eggs must be gatheredsomewhere, the police were expected to gather them from the aeries ofthe vultures that preyed upon women.Riley had not minded, every pay-day, handing over to the appointedheeler the five dollars wherefor he received a receipt for a dollarand a half as dues to the political club to which he was expected tobelong.  For quite some time he had been content with closing hiseyes to saloons that were opened on Sundays by proprietors that werepowerful, and with allowing others to profit by the rewards of hisvoluntary blindness.  But at last there came the first baby in theRiley home, and then the second, and the wife\\'s long illness; andthen assessments were increased and, finally, after many a broad hintfrom the men higher up, he was given plainly to understand that hemust either hand over a goodly portion of money, every week, from theoffending women on his beat, or else lose his usefulness to the force.After that, he took what he must and kept what he could.  He had notrade on which to fall back; his domestic and political expenses grewannually, and, as an evasion of the former meant financial ruin, sothe shirking of the latter meant a charge lodged at headquarters, aspeedy hearing, and an automatic dismissal.  Even when a non-partisanman was put at the head of the department, that official\\'s practicalpower was nullified by the fact that the mayor, a party-man, wasbehind him and could remove him at a moment\\'s notice, and that behindthe mayor was the organization that had made and could break themayor.  No individual, so far as Officer Riley could see, waspersonally to blame, was himself a free agent; but the wholecollection of individuals were the irresponsible parts of a giganticmachine--from the inner council of Tammany to their spies in everymunicipal department--which, if ever broken by the recognized partyof opposition, must be so thoroughly rebuilt and so preciselyoperated in accordance with mechanical lines that the change wouldsignify only the casting out of the irresponsible parts and theirreplacement by parts equally irresponsible.  Riley could look nofarther, and, even could he have seen that the remedy must be aremedy of conditions, he could have done nothing to free himself.At the station-house he delivered the commands that O\\'Malley hadgiven him.  There his words produced consternation, but no thought ofdisaffection.  The patrol-wagon was ordered to be in its stable,ready to leave at the given hour, and Riley, as the officer regularlyassigned to night-work on the beat in which stood Rose\\'s house, wasforced to remain to accompany it.\"An\\' see here, you men,\"--these were the words with which the briefinstructions were concluded--\"you see to it nobody gets ahead of you.This is O\\'Malley\\'s job, an\\' it\\'s got to be done right.\"In the underworld of every city, news, however, travels even while itis in the making, and in no direction does it travel more swiftly,just as in no other does it travel more indirectly, than, when theslave-trade is concerned, it travels to the traders.  Riley wascareful to remain in full view of the sergeant\\'s desk from the momentthe arrangements were made until the time of execution--he would nothave dared to communicate with the friends that had thus swiftlybecome the enemy--none of the wagon-crew were seen to leave thestable, to use the telephone, or to speak to a passerby, and yet,shortly before the appointed time, through a certain club-room over anot far distant saloon--a club-room much affected by young men in MaxGrossman\\'s profession--there soon spread the definite tidings thatRosie Légère had just been \"piped off.\"The swarthy and brilliant Rafael Angelelli heard the word, andstraightway, beyond all doubting, confirmed it.  With the unheededeasy evening breeze tumbling his uncovered oily locks, he ran to thenearest booth-telephone, and hurriedly called Rose upon the wire.\"Eet ees comin\\'!\" he whispered excitedly into the transmitter.Rose\\'s voice replied with stolid assurance.\"What\\'s comin\\'?\" she asked.\"_Poliziotti_--cops,\" replied the Italian, finding more and moredifficulty with his English as his panic increased.  \"Eet ees Angeltalkin\\'.--I jus\\' getta da _nuova_.--They maka da pinch!\"\"Quit your kiddin\\'.\"\"Naw.  _Veraménte.  Crêdi tu!_  Queeck!\"His fright hit the mark.\"How\\'d it happen?\" demanded Rose.  \"Who\\'s back of it?\"\"Dees Meest\\' Dyker.\"\"You fool Dago\"--her voice grew shrill with fear and anger--\"can\\'tyou do nothin\\'?\"\"Naw.  \\'E\\'s been to O\\'Malley.\"\"You\\'re a hell of a help!  How about Riley an\\' the rest?\"\"Naw.  O\\'Malley maka them do thees.\"\"It\\'s that slut Violet, that\\'s who it is!  That\\'s gratitude for you.I\\'ve been half expectin\\' trouble since she got loose last night.--Howlong have I?\"\"I don\\' know.  Maybe five min\\'; maybe one.\"\"My Gawd!\"\"Don\\' hang up!  Leesten: firs\\' t\\'eeng you do getta da new girl out.Eef they getta dees new girl you go----\"But there came a quick click from the other end of the wire.  Rosehad ended the conversation.Angel, still hatless, hurried through the few intervening streets anddarted into that street to which he had just been speaking.Already the early New York twilight had descended, and the blockseemed, at first glance, to have turned to slumber.  One distant,spluttering arc-light succeeded only in accentuating the gloom.  Fromthe patch of darkening sky into which the roofs blended, a barehandful of pale stars twinkled weakly, and on both sides, from cornerto corner, the uniform, narrow houses rose in somber repetition, eachwith its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each with its shutteredwindows, each silent behind its mask.All this the Italian saw with accustomed eyes, and then he dartedinto the shadow of an areaway, because he saw also that, brief as hadbeen his journey, Riley had arrived before him.In a little knot of wise children, a patrol wagon, its sophisticatedhorses unconcernedly dozing, stood before Rose\\'s house.  An officerwas in the doorway; hurried lights shifted from behind one bowedshutter to another, and gradually Angel became conscious that, allalong the street, frightened faces were peeping from stealthilylifted blinds.For quite some time the watcher waited.  At last the big figure ofRiley and a companion appeared in the open doorway and spoke tosomeone in the wagon.  Through the evening quiet their voices camedistinctly.\"Ready?\" asked Riley.\"All ready,\" came the answer.\"We\\'ve got the madam an\\' the nigger, an\\' the four of thim, but Ibelave they must have turned the new girl loose before we got here.\"This time the reply came from within the house, and it came in thetones of Rose, raised high in anger and in blasphemy:\"You\\'re a dirty liar, Larry Riley!  There never was another one, an\\'you know that as well as I do!  Just you wait till I tell the judgewhat you do know, you damned, low, double-crossin\\' sneak!  Youbastard, you!\"Riley and his companions turned and ran into the vestibule.\"Just you wait,\" the cry continued.  \"Just you wait, you thief,you----\"The voice stopped as suddenly as it had started.There was another pause, a longer one, and then Angel, bending as faras he dared from his hidden corner, saw the two officers come quicklyout with their hands upon the arms of two cloaked women, whom theyhelped into the dark recesses of the patrol-wagon.  They went backand returned with one more.  A fourth followed; then a fifth, and asixth.  Two policemen appeared, evidently from positions that theyhad been guarding in the rear of the house.  The man on the stepsclosed the door and locked it.  All the policemen climbed to thewagon.  The driver gathered up the reins.  The tittering childrenscattered wildly.  The horses woke up and started away at a brisktrot.Impartial Justice was beginning her task.XVISANCTUARYTo leave the protection of Dyker and the kindly secrecy of the cab,and then to leap into a tide of alien human beings and swim againstthem in a strange and terrifying sea, had required the last grain ofcourage and strength that was left in Violet\\'s sapped body and cowedsoul.  It was only by the momentum that Wesley\\'s calm directions hadgiven her, and quite without consciousness upon her own part that,with her cloak gripped tightly about her, she tottered forward,buffeted and shrinking, to the first corner, wheeled to the rightinto a street comfortingly darker, turned again into a still narrowerand quieter way, and then came to an uncertain stop before whatseemed to be no street at all, but only a small black rift among thebeetling walls of brick.Empty as was the way compared with Rivington Street, it was what, hadshe not seen the former thoroughfare, she would have consideredoppressively full.  Urchins walked hand in hand along the gutters,push-cart men cried their wares over the cobbles and, in the hotnight, frowzy women crowded the house-steps.  A clatter of voices, offoreign tongues and unfamiliar forms of English, rattled out thegossip of the neighborhood, and a few steps away, a belatedhurdy-gurdy shook forth a popular tune.Violet cowered against the nearest wall.  She was uncertain as to howto proceed, and she was afraid to stand still.  There seized her anunreasoned terror lest all this seeming escape might be some newtrick leading into some new trap.  A policeman passed with heavytread, but, unmindful of Dyker\\'s assurance, the girl drew, trembling,as far away from him as she could.  Then, when her straining eyes sawhim turn at the next corner to retrace his steps, she made sure thathe was coming back to recapture her, and, now desperate, she faced apair of solemn children slowly approaching from the oppositedirection.The six-year-old boy to whom she especially addressed herself shookan uncomprehending head, but his wiser companion, a very dirty littlegirl of seven, made proud answer.\"He don\\'t to speak no English,\" she said.  \"He only can tell thingsout of Jewish.  But I tells you.  That there\\'s your street rightbehind you.  Yiss, ma\\'am.  An\\' your house is by the two on that thereside.\"Violet\\'s lips tried to form a word of thanks.  She turned, as thegirl had ordered, into the rift among the brick walls, found that,once it had traveled beyond the depth of the house before which shehad been standing, it opened to a width of a few additional feet, andso, almost creeping through the Stygian passage in which shone onlyone far-away lamp, she felt her way to the second door.It was partially open, and a jet of blue gas in the hallway burnedoverhead.  She could see several doors in the shadows, but all wereclosed.  She heard a dragging step coming down the stairs.  She drewagainst the wall and waited.The step was slow and uncertain.  It seemed to consider well beforeeach movement forward, but it had a character that reassured her.  Itwas the same sort of step with which her father was wont to returnhome after his occasional carouses, and she knew that whoso walked inthat fashion was, so long as one kept out of reach, not greatly to befeared.  She remained hidden until the step drew nearer, until thedark bulk of the drunkard slowly massed itself out of the surroundingdarkness, until it had brushed by her.  Then she spoke.\"Can you tell me,\" she asked, \"if there\\'s a Miss Flanagan lives here?\"The passerby was not in a condition where voices from nowhere seemedremarkable.  He stopped and, evidently not clear as to just whencethis particular voice proceeded, addressed the air immediately beforehim.\"I can so,\" he said.\"Then will you, please?\"\"Will I what?\" responded the passerby, determined that the air shouldbe more specific.\"Will you please _tell_ me?\"\"Tell you what?\"\"Is there a Miss Flanagan lives here?\"\"There is that.  There\\'s three of her, an\\' wan of thim\\'s a Missus.Good-night.\"Awkwardly he touched his hat to the air and stumbled out into thealley.Violet breathed hard.  She had never in her life before been in atenement-house; but she knew that now she must seek a door throughwhich some ray of light gave hint of waking persons within and,knocking, of them inquire anew.  Around her, all the doors wereforbidding, so, timidly and with a hand tight upon the shaking rail,she softly climbed the decrepit stairs.At the second floor a shaft of yellow light stopped her.Here was a door that was open, and beyond it, by an uncovered dealtable on which stood a rude kerosene lamp, sat two figures: thefigure of an old woman, her gnarled hands clasped loosely in heraproned lap, her dim eyes gazing at the sightless window, and thefigure of a young woman, her hands beneath her round chin, her wideeyes on a naked baby quietly sleeping in a clothes-basket at herknee.  The floor was uncarpeted, the walls unadorned, the room almostbare of furniture; but on the face of her that looked into the pastand in the face of her that looked into the future there was peace.A quick stroke of pain stabbed the onlooker\\'s heart, but she draggedherself ahead and, not to disturb the baby, spoke without knocking.The old woman turned, and Violet noticed that the eyes which couldsee so far behind were blind and could see no step forward.  Themother, however, spoke kindly and gave the directions that the girlneeded; but Violet, wanting to say something about the baby inreturn, and, able only to murmur formal thanks, pursued her climbupward.She found at last the door that she was certain must be KatieFlanagan\\'s, but, when she had found it, all power of further motionsuddenly ceased.  Weakness, shame, and fear swept over her like acloud of evil gases from an endangered mine, and she swayed againstthe panel before her.Inside, Katie and the shirtwaist-maker, just ready for bed, heard thefaint sound without and, opening the door, caught the almost faintingfigure in their arms.  The dark cloak dropped open, disclosing thecrimson kimona beneath, and this, awakening Violet\\'s one dominatingpassion--the terror of detection and consequent recapture--roused thefugitive a little.  She staggered away from the assisting hands,wrapped the cloak tightly around her, and leaned, panting, againstthe wall.\"Miss--Miss Flanagan?\" she gasped.Katie nodded her black head.\"That\\'s me,\" she said.\"I\\'m--I\\'m the--I\\'m Violet.\"The Irish girl comprehended quickly.  With Irish tact she refused,just then, to hear more; with Irish volubility she burst intoexclamations of pity, and with ready Irish sympathy she took Violetin her strong arms.\"Put her on my cot,\" said Carrie, and they led her there.They took away her cloak, for she was now too weak to protest, and,though they did pause in awe before the crimson kimona, they hurriedto make their guest comfortable.  The Lithuanian Jewess movedsilently and swiftly about with that calm competence whichcharacterizes her people, and Katie, fanning the white face andchafing the thin hands, continued to croon condolences.\"There now!\" she at last smiled, as Violet\\'s blue eyes opened.  \"Sureyou\\'re yourself again entirely.  Don\\'t say a word, not one word, an\\'just tell us whatever \\'tis you might be wantin\\'.\"\"Whiskey,\" gasped Violet.The girls looked at each other.\"That\\'s all right,\" said the Jewess, quietly; \"I can spare it\"--andshe handed Katie some small change.The Irish girl flung a shawl over her head, and ran down the stairs.She went into the side door of the nearest saloon, entered a narrowcompartment, passed the money through a hole in a partition, and wasgiven a small flask partly filled.  Within five minutes she hadreturned, and Violet, drinking the contents of the bottle at a singledraught, began to revive.\"Are you hungry, darlin\\'?\" asked Katie.Violet shook her russet head.\"No,\" she answered, \"I couldn\\'t eat, thanks.  I\\'m only just playedout.\"\"Poor dear, you look it.  But you\\'re all right now, an\\' you can restas long as you like.  Don\\'t you bother.  Don\\'t you worry.  Don\\'t yoube afraid.  You got away without any trouble, did you?\"\"Yes,\" said Violet, and because she was still unable to frame herlips to adequate thanks, she gave them as much of the story of herescape as she could give without mention of the name of her rescuer,who had warned her that he must not be publicly known to figure inthe case.\"A man?\" echoed the cynical Katie.  \"An\\' he didn\\'t ask nothin\\' inreturn?\"\"No.\"\"He must be worth knowin\\', that man.\"\"He only wants me to go somewhere an\\' swear to all Rose done to me.\"\"Oh!\"--Katie\\'s tone showed that she could now account for thegentleman\\'s generosity.--\"Well, don\\'t you do it.\"But Violet could not follow her.\"Why not?\" she asked.\"I don\\'t know just why; but don\\'t you do it.\"\"I promised,\" said Violet.\"Och, listen to the poor dear!\" Katie appealed to her fellow-lodger.\"I wonder is it long she thinks he\\'d be keepin\\' his word to her.\"Her own word freshened the ever-abiding terror in the runaway\\'sheart, but Violet said no more about it.\"Would you have much to swear to?\" asked Carrie, seated on the footof the cot.\"What do you mean?\" Violet parried.\"She means, Violet----\" began Katie.The fugitive, in her new surroundings, shrank from the name.\"Don\\'t!  Don\\'t call me that!\" she said.\"Sure an\\' ain\\'t it the name you gave me yourself?\"\"I know, but I don\\'t want to hear it ever again.  Call me Mary; callme Mary----\"And there, face to face with a new danger, Violet came to a stop.Her captivity had taught her much of bestiality, but it had taughther besides only that some unknown, tremendous power hated her; thatshe was debased and must never, at whatever cost of further sufferingto herself, permit her degradation to attach to her family; that shemust escape, but that she must also wholly divorce herself from allthat life had meant her to be.  She had no thought of the future; shehad only a realization of what had been and what was.\"Mary what?\" asked Carrie.\"Mary Morton,\" lied Violet.  Perhaps she had heard the name before;perhaps the easy alliteration brought it first to her mind.  At allevents, she reflected, one name was as good as another, so long as itwas not her own.\"Would you have much to swear to?\" Carrie was continuing.  \"Is it asbad as they say--there?\"Violet looked at the round, serious face before her.\"I don\\'t know what they say,\" she replied; \"but it\\'s worse thananybody can say.  There\\'s a lot of it you can\\'t say, because there\\'sa lot of it there ain\\'t no words ever been made up for.  Just youpray God you won\\'t ever have to find out how bad it is.\"They looked at her and saw on her the marks of which she was not yetaware.Katie bent over and swiftly kissed the fevered forehead under itstumbled russet hair.\"You poor woman,\" she said with unintended implication, \"an\\' how manyyears did you have to stand it?\"\"It wasn\\'t years; it was--it was only weeks.\"\"What?  An\\' they could get a grown woman like you?\"Violet tried to smile.\"How old do you think I am?\" she asked.Katie made what she considered a charitable reply.\"Twenty-five?\"\"I\\'m not seventeen.\"Katie began to busy herself about the room, and Carrie turned herhead.\"Ah, well,\" said Katie, \"you\\'re tired out, an\\' it\\'s \\'most mornin\\'.We must all go to sleep now.\"\"I only put on long dresses in April,\" said Violet.But Katie seemed not to hear her.  She hurried the arrangements forthe night.\"Sleep as long as you like in the morning,\" said Carrie; \"and if youcan wear any of our things, wear \\'em.  We have to get up early, butdon\\'t mind us.\"The latter injunction was unnecessary.  Though Violet had for sometime been excited by her escape, that excitement had already givenplace to utter exhaustion.  The lamp had scarcely been extinguishedbefore, with throbbing head, she passed into a sleep that was almostcoma, and the lamp that was burning when she opened her aching eyeswas the lamp of midmorning.She was alone and afraid to be alone.  Her head seemed splitting.She saw the milk and rolls that Katie had set out for her on theoilcloth-covered table, but her stomach revolted at the thought offood, and her poisoned nerves cried out for alcohol.  She got up andmanaged to pull on some of the clothes belonging to her two hostesses.From her first glance at the mirror, she drew back in bewilderment.During all her imprisonment she had been used, through her gradualchange, to compare her morning appearance with that of her fellowslaves; but now there was fresh in her mind the standard, not ofthose pale and worn, though often fat and hardened, convicts, but ofthe pair of healthy girls that had, the night before, sheltered her;and from that standard her very image in the glass seemed to withdrawin horror.  Lacking rouge, her cheeks, once so pink and firm, werepasty and pendant; her lips hung loose, her blue eyes were dull andblurred; even her hair appeared colorless and brittle.  Little lineshad formed at the corners of her eyes; her skin seemed rough andcracked, and other lines were already faintly showing from hernostrils to the corners of her mouth.She sat down on the cot, sick and shivering.  When she noticed asmall pile of bedding in the corner behind the gas-stove, she shookat the memory of another such pile on another terrible morning, andby the time she had realized that one of her friends must have sleptthere in order to provide an extra couch, she was too wracked bysuffering, physical and mental, to feel, at once, any greatgratitude.  The fever throbbed in her wrists, beat in her heart,hammered in her brain.  She did not dare go to the street for whiskeyor medicine.  At every sound on the stairs she started up in theassurance that her keepers had come to recover her, and when, in theearly afternoon, a loud knocking sounded on the door, she fell, inunresponding silence, before Katie\\'s flaring lithograph of Our Ladyof the Rosary.\"Hello in there!\" called a not overcautious voice.  \"I want to talkto Miss Violet!\"Violet raised her clasped hands to the printed face before her.\"Don\\'t let them take me!\" she whispered in a prayer to that visiblesign of a power she had never before addressed.  \"Don\\'t let them takeme!\"\"Open up, can\\'t you?\" the voice insisted.  \"I know there\\'s somebodyinside, an\\', honest, I\\'m not going to hurt you!\"Violet\\'s hands fell.  The voice, she realized, was at leastunfamiliar.\"Come on,\" it wheedled.  \"I\\'m all right; I\\'m from Mr. Dyker.\"\"What do you want?\" she inquired.\"He said Miss Violet would know,\" came the answer.  \"He said I wouldbe expected--that it\\'d be all right if I just told you I came fromhim.\"Violet had not forgotten Katie\\'s warning, but she was unable whollyto doubt the one man that had befriended her.  She opened the door.The pink-and-white young clerk that entered was much embarrassed, andhis hostess, in her fever, did not ease him.  Nevertheless, aftermany hesitations on his own part, and more repetitions andexplanations made necessary by Violet, he at last convinced her thathe did indeed come from Wesley Dyker, and that there was waitingaround the corner the cab that would convey her to an office whereshe could begin the redemption of her pledge.Almost in a dream, and too ill now much to care what happened to her,she followed the messenger.  Dazedly she greeted Dyker in the cab;confusedly she left that conveyance for an office where she answeredinterminable questions put to her by another young man who, she wastold, was an Assistant District Attorney; vaguely she heard Dykerassure this official, as she affixed a signature to an offered paper,that Wesley would himself guarantee her appearance whenever it wasrequired, and when she was at last wheeled back and had climbed thestairs and, alone, fallen again upon Carrie\\'s cot, the only one ofrecent facts concerning which she was at all certain was that she hadsaid she was a native of Pittsburgh and that her name was Mary Morton.Katie and Carrie, returning together, found her flushed and babblingnonsense.  When they approached her, she did not recognize them, andthen, for an hour, they could get from her only the monotonousrepetition:\"Don\\'t let them get me!  Don\\'t tell them my name!\"It was eight o\\'clock before the patient, quieted by sympathy andstimulated by whiskey, could be taken to the nearest drugstore, andthere, as soon as the experienced druggist set eyes on her, herefused to prescribe.He beckoned Katie to a corner.\"That girl\\'s got to go to a hospital,\" he said; \"and if I was you, Iwouldn\\'t lose much time in getting her there.\"Katie the competent lost none.  After another drink to stiflepossible protest, Violet was taken upon a car to Sixteenth Street,and was then walked quickly westward.  During all the way she did notspeak, and, when she reached the hospital\\'s fortunately emptyreceiving-ward, she was nearly unconscious.A white-capped nurse received the little party, the young doctor, inshirt-sleeves and duck trousers, hovering in the background among theglass shelves agleam with instruments of polished steel.\"What\\'s the trouble?\" asked the nurse.\"It\\'s that that we\\'ve come to find out of you,\" answered Katie.The nurse nodded to the doctor.He came forward and made a quick examination.\"Bring this woman inside and put her on the table,\" he ordered.  \"Andyou girls, stop where you are.\"Her head thrown back, her dry mouth wide, and her russet hairfalling, the unresisting Violet was carried behind a door that shutsmartly after her.Too scared to speak, Katie and her companion stood outside.  Fiveminutes passed.  Then ten.  After a quarter of an hour, the doorreopened.\"What\\'s this patient\\'s name?\" he asked.\"Mary Morton,\" said Carrie.\"Where does she live?\"Katie gave her own address, and the doctor, a pad of printed forms inhand, noted both the answers.That done, he paused and bit his pencil.\"Married?\" he asked quickly.\"Who?\" parried Katie.  \"Me?\"\"No; the patient.\"\"Well, now,\" began Katie, \"I can\\'t see as that\\'s----\"But the calm voice of Carrie interrupted.\"She is married,\" she said.The doctor pursed incredulous lips.\"Where\\'s her husband?\" he demanded.Katie, who had caught the need of the moment, jumped into the breach.\"Where a lot of them are,\" she responded, \"an\\' where as many moremight as well be, for all the use they are to their poor wives.\"\"Where\\'s that?\"\"Faith, it\\'s you, sir, ought to know: you\\'re the man.\"\"Dead?\"\"Run away.\"\"Not much later than yesterday, did he?  Well, I must find hernearest relative or friend.  Are you either?\"Katie\\'s face lengthened.\"Och, doctor,\" she said, \"you don\\'t mean to--but it can\\'t be thatthere\\'s goin\\' to be a baby!\"The young interne grinned.  Then, serious again, he answered:\"No, there is not.  I only wish it was so simple.  Where are herfolks?\"\"She\\'s none in the world, an\\' no money.  The hard truth is, doctor,that it\\'s a charity-patient she\\'ll have to be.\"\"That\\'s all right; but are you her nearest friends?\"\"Yes, doctor.\"\"That\\'ll do, I guess.  She\\'s a nervous wreck--among other things.We\\'ve first of all got to get her round from that condition, and thenI\\'ll have to secure either her own or your permission, as her nearestfriends, to do something more.\"\"More?\" repeated Katie.  \"Ain\\'t it bad enough as it is?  What more doyou mean to do to the poor--girl?\"\"I don\\'t mean to do anything myself, but this is a common enough kindof case around here to make me certain what the resident surgeon willdo: he\\'ll operate.\"XVII\"A NET BY THE WAYSIDE\"Hermann Hoffmann, passing one evening to the little clothes-pressbehind the bar in Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon, and putting on the canvascoat that was his badge of office, heard the voice of the proprietorcalling his name, and turned to see that stout German-Americanbeckoning him to enter the back-room where, a month before, O\\'Malleyhad held with Wesley Dyker that conference which had proved sodisastrous to Rose Légère.He walked through the open door, whistling his Teutonic melody.  Hehad not that fear of his employer which most employees have of theman for whom they work.  Schleger had proved himself lenient andgood-natured, and Hermann, whose cheerful round face and easy smiledid not interfere with the use of a knotted arm and a mighty fist,was quite aware that there was no complaint justly to be made againstthe manner in which he performed his alloted tasks.\"Hoffmann,\" said Schleger, smiling, \"you\\'re all right.\"\"Sure,\" grinned Hermann.\"Yes,\" pursued the proprietor, \"I been thinkin\\' about you that yousure have made good.\"\"I\\'m glad you vas sadisfied, Schleger.\"\"I am satisfied; but I think you need a little more time off now an\\'then.  I haven\\'t got nothin\\' to do this evenin\\'.  I\\'ll take yourplace.\"Hermann\\'s eyes brightened with unaffected pleasure.  It had notalways been pleasant to work in the nights when Katie was all daybusy in the shop.\"Thanks,\" he said.\"Yes,\" nodded Schleger, benignantly; \"it will be like old times forme.  You take a night off.\"\"Shall I start out righd avay?\"\"Certainly.--Of course you understand I\\'ll want you around here theday of the primaries.\"Hermann nodded.\"And Hermann, there\\'s somethin\\' else I\\'ve been meanin\\' to talk to youabout, and kep\\' forgettin\\' till O\\'Malley reminded me of it again thisafternoon.\"Hoffmann, pulling off his white jacket, stopped with arms extended.\"O\\'Malley?\" he said in a strained voice.  \"Vat\\'s dot man got to dovith me?\"\"Well, you know he don\\'t miss no tricks nowheres, an\\' some time backI was tellin\\' him what a good man you was, an\\' he said we ought toget you a little more active for him.  A fellow behind a bar can do awhole lot that way, you know,--an\\' make a good thing of it.\"\"I know,\" replied Hermann, ripping off the coat, \"but I ain\\'t nopolitician.\"\"Nobody said you was, but all the fellows help a little.\"\"Sure; only I don\\'t.\"\"Why not?  We want to do well for the slate this time.  WesleyDyker\\'s on it; you know him; he\\'s all right.\"\"I ain\\'t no politician, Schleger.\"This stolid attitude plainly began to puzzle the proprietor.\"Don\\'t be a fool, Hoffmann,\" he said.  \"The boys all have their eyeon you, an\\' O\\'Malley don\\'t forget any of his friends.\"\"Schleger, I got my own friends, und I make my own friends.  I don\\'tvant nussing I don\\'t earn from nobody.\"\"But that sort of thing won\\'t look right,\" argued Schleger.  \"Yousee, you\\'re registered from here--\"No I ain\\'t, Schleger; I\\'m registered from my own blace.\"\"Well, I didn\\'t know that; you didn\\'t tell me, an\\' so I registeredyou from here.\"Hoffmann\\'s pink cheeks became red.  He folded his coat neatly overhis arm.\"Vatch here, Schleger,\" he began.  \"I ain\\'t no politician.  I don\\'tcare----\"But he bit his lip and mastered himself to silence.The proprietor saw this and appreciated the self-control that itmanifested.  There had been a time when he had felt as Hermann feltnow, and so he was not disposed to use harsh argument.  He came closeto Hoffmann and, still smiling, dropped his voice to a whisper.\"That\\'s all right,\" he said, soothingly.  \"I guess I know how youlook at it.  Don\\'t say that I said so, but we\\'ll let the matter dropif you only lay low a little and keep quiet.  You know the brewery\\'sbackin\\' me in this saloon, an\\' you know, with the brewery pushin\\' meall the time for its money, I couldn\\'t run the place a month if Ididn\\'t keep the side-door open Sundays.  Well, then, how could I keepthe place workin\\' Sundays if it wasn\\'t for O\\'Malley?  Just try not tobe openly again\\' him, that\\'s all.\"Hermann did not commit himself, but his tone had softened when, inreply, he asked:\"Und should I take to-night off?\"\"Certainly you should.  Go along now, an\\' ferget it.\"He went, but as he walked down the avenue, \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\"issued from his lips to the time of a funeral-march.His sole consolation lay in the fact that, in the recent glimpses hehad secured of Katie, that young lady had begun to evince signs ofrelenting from her former attitude of celibacy.  He knew that she hadgradually ceased to descant upon the impossibility of his supportinga wife, and he thought that she was entertaining hopes of a promotionin the shop to a position where her own earnings, added to his, wouldmake a comfortable living-wage for two.What he did not know--and this for the excellent reason that Katiewould not tell it to him--was that, whatever their prospects for thefuture, both Katie and her roommate were still engaged in that battlewith poverty and temptation which had lessened scarcely one whitsince its beginning.  For the former the fortunes of war were lessthan ever favorable, and for the latter the most that was expectedwas the maintenance of her stand in the face of every armed reason tosurrender or retreat.The strike dragged along its wearied length.  Popular sympathy, whichhad aided the shirtwaist-makers in their former rebellion, had lostits interest in the cause, and, as the newspapers said less, theemployers became more demonstrative.  Hired thugs guarded thefactories and beat whatever young women dared, by the simplest words,to plead, in public, with the scab laborers.  When these battlesoccurred the police, knowing well the interests of their masters,arrested the mere girls for assault and battery upon the thugs,forcing them to remain, if detained, on benches with women old inimmorality and crime; and the magistrates before whom these dangerousfemale criminals were hailed, not forgetting which party to the suitcould vote at the coming election, would often send the offenders tothe Reformatory or the Island, where they could no longer interfere,or would impose fines calculated still more to deplete a strike-fundalready pitiably shrunken.  Some of the unionists had already laiddown their arms and returned to the factories; more had gone over toanother enemy and disappeared beneath the dark current of theunderworld.  The rest--and Carrie was among the number--must sooncome face to face with starvation.Katie\\'s difficulties, though as yet less physical, were scarcely lesspoignant.  She found that she was rarely left long in one portion ofthe Lennox shop.  From the chief woman\\'s-hosiery department, she wasshifted, without warning, to the handkerchief counter, and thence,again with no explanation, she was sent to help in the main aisle ata table where there was a special sale of stockings at reduced prices.At first these frequent shiftings appeared to result from no apparentcause.  She was fined as much as the other clerks, but no more thanthey, and she could in no wise account for the changes.  But at lastshe noticed that after a shift for the worse the sacrosanct Mr.Porter would usually happen by and open a conversation, and then sheremembered that, before such a shift, this same side-whiskeredgentleman had generally made overtures, and that those overtures hadnot been well received.  The theory arising from these observationsshe resolved to confirm.  After the next move she made deliberateeyes at the man she detested, and she was next day promoted, with atwenty-five cent increase of pay per week, to the silk-stockingcounter.  From that day she saw her warfare developing into adangerous game of hide-and-seek in which Mr. Porter was \"It,\" andfrom that day dated her increasing tendency to reconsider thedetermination not to marry Hermann Hoffmann.For Violet, meanwhile, the young interne\\'s prophesy had beenfulfilled.  Four days after her admission to the hospital there hadbeen performed upon her that operation which had been made necessaryby her servitude, but to which, had she been consulted, her fearswould never have allowed her to consent.  For three weeks she lay inher narrow bed among other sufferers, and, when at last the fictionof discharging her as \"cured\" had been accomplished, and thefive-cent carfare donated by the hospital to charity-patients hadbeen given, she had been met by Katie and Carrie, and had totteredbetween them to their room.During another week she had now rested there.  Her eyes were stillsunken, dull, dark-rimmed; her cheeks white and transparently thin.The knuckles of her fingers seemed to have grown larger, and herhands were nearly transparent.  But her lips, though bloodless, hadgained a new firmness.  Clearly or deeply she could never think,without help from a stronger and better mind; yet she had made whatuse she might of her long leisure and had resolved, more or lessdefinitely, upon what she would do with her life.\"I went out an\\' walked a block by myself yesterday,\" she confessed toher two friends early on the evening of Hermann\\'s politicaldiscussion with his employer; \"an\\' I didn\\'t get any tired an\\' wasn\\'thardly any scared.  Now I want you to take me for a longer walkto-night an\\' then by to-morrow I\\'ll be all right.\"They protested that she must not spur her convalescence, but she wasdetermined.  It was, she knew, impossible for them much longer tosupport her, and the last of her one ten-dollar bill had long agobeen spent.\"I\\'ll tell you what we might do,\" Carrie at last suggested.  \"There\\'ssome sort of a concert over at the settlement to-night.  We might goto that.  I used to know some of the ladies there, and there\\'s alwaysa chance that they can get you a job.\"While she was speaking Hermann\\'s whistle, more cheerful now than whenhe had left the saloon, sounded on the stairs, and Katie, surprisedand glad, opened the door to his knock.\"Late to your work again,\" she said, with a smile that belied her.\"How\\'ll you ever be holdin\\' that job, anyhow?\"The newcomer\\'s only answer was a courageous and unrebuked kiss.  Heturned to Carrie.\"Vat you sink of such a vay of meetin\\' me?\" he appealed.  \"My bossgives me a nighd off, und I haf seen my girl not fur ten days undden----\"He paused as his unrecognizing eye fell upon Violet.\"Egscuse me,\" he began.  \"I didn\\'t see----\"\"Of course you didn\\'t see it was your old friend Violet that was an\\'Miss Morton that is,\" interrupted Katie, with a quick desire toshield her charge.  \"You\\'re gettin\\' that near-sighted I wonder howyou can tell a whiskey-glass from a beer-stein.\"Hermann hurried forward in rosy embarrassment and saved Violet fromrising.  He took her frail hand in his big paw and poured out atumbling stream of polite lies upon the matter of her health.\"I guess it ain\\'t quite as good as you say,\" replied Violet; \"but itsoon will be.  Have you--I didn\\'t get no news while I was sick.  Haveyou heard anything about--things?\"\"You knew Rose\\'s place was pinched?\"\"Yes, Katie told me that.\"\"Well, dey had some trouble gettin\\' pail fur her.  Everybody vasafraid fur to do it vith O\\'Malley after her.  Still, dey vorked itsomevays und nobody thought but she\\'d jump it und run avay; but shedidn\\'t.  She tried, but O\\'Malley had central office men keepin\\' eyeson her, und she can\\'t leaf town.\"Katie and Carrie were busying themselves in the preparation of thesupper, and the German seated himself beside the invalid.\"Mr. Hoffmann,\" she said, \"I\\'ve been tryin\\' to think of lots ofthings while I\\'ve been sick, an\\' I\\'d like to know how it is thatwomen like Miss Rose are allowed?\"He looked at her, hesitating, but her eyes were frankly curious.\"Dot\\'s von long story,\" he answered in his slow tones, \"un\\' dem ascan tell it best is most all in deir houses or in deir graves, orelse, in de streets.\"\"Then I guess I was lucky to get away.\"\"If you don\\'t mind me sayin\\' it--yes, miss.\"\"But don\\'t the girls get free when the houses are pinched?\"\"No,\" said Hermann, as gently as he could; \"dey don\\'t get free.  Oferto de Night Court a voman has taken five s\\'ousand to a blace she has,und how many sink you didn\\'t go back to de vork again?  Less\\'n vonhundret und fifty.\"\"I don\\'t see how they could,\" said Violet.Hermann could not see how they could do anything else, but he onlyshrugged his broad shoulders.\"They don\\'t last long anyvays,\" he remarked.\"You mean they die soon?\"\"Effery five year all de girls is new: it\\'s as sure as lifeinsurance.\"The girl shuddered, but mastered herself.\"Don\\'t mind that,\" she reassured him.  \"I want to know--honest.Katie and Carrie won\\'t be bothered----\"\"We can\\'t hear a word you\\'re sayin\\', darlin\\',\" laughed Katie.\"An\\', honest,\" Violet concluded.  \"There\\'s some things I think I\\'vegot to learn so\\'s I can see it--see it _all_.\"She appealed, it happened, to an authority.  Hermann supplemented hisMarx with facts and statistics of a later date, especially upon thepoint at issue, and he was only too glad to find in Violet thelistener that he could never discover in Katie.\"You\\'re righd,\" he said; \"und the only pity is dot more people don\\'ttry to more about it learn.  If dey did, maybe ve\\'d all open our eyessome.\"And he proceeded to open Violet\\'s eyes not a little.  He told her ofthe hundreds of thousands of girls that are annually caught in thegreat net; of how five thousand new ones are every year needed tomaintain Chicago\\'s standing supply of twenty-five thousand; of howBoston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco--all the cities andthe towns--are served proportionately, and of how, above all, fromthe crowded East Side of New York, there are dragged each weekhundreds of children and young women no one of whom, if soldoutright, brings as much as a capable horse.\"Some ve bring in,\" he said, \"und some ve send out.  Ve take fromItaly, und ve send to Sous America.  From all ofer the vorld ve take,und to all ofer the vorld ve send.\"\"You don\\'t always blame the girls?\"\"Plame dem?  A girl as lived by us, she did tucking in a undervearfactory.  She has coffee und a roll fur preakfast, tea und a roll furlunch, von biece of bacon und von egg fur supper effery nighd.  Tenhours a day in a bad smelling room, crowded vis ozzer girls, she runsdot machine.  Part de year she has no vork, because always de factorydoes not run, but vhen de years ends, dot machine, makin\\' fourdousand stitches a minute, she has tucked dree miles of undervear undgot paid dree hundred dollars.  Do I plame such a girl if she easycomes to belief a paid veasel as makes lofe to her und says hemarries her und gets her avay from a factory?\"\"All of the girls don\\'t come from such hard jobs though.\"\"So?  Look now!\"He took from an inside pocket a fistful of soiled envelopes andshuffled them until he found one on which he had transcribed somefigures.\"Yesderday afternoon to dis Astor Library I found a report vat vasmade by people sent out by de State of Massachusetts.  It got a kindof census from four dousand vomen in sixty different cities, allofer.  Before dey vent bad, five hundret vas garment-vorkers, undeight hundret vas rope-makers, milliners, laundry people, paper-box,cigar und cigarette makers, candy-box packers, or vorked in textilemills or shoe factories.

Und all de rest--all deozzer sixty-two per cent.--vere girls who hadn\\'t had not jobs, unddey had to live und couldn\\'t no ozzer vay earn a livin\\'!\"\"Then you think,\" asked Violet, \"they wouldn\\'t go wrong if they couldget decent work at decent wages?\"Hermann looked at her quickly.\"Vould you?\" he asked.She shivered and shook her head and Hermann, seeing that the heat ofhis zeal had led him into a personal appeal that all his normallyslow instincts prompted him to avoid, hurried back to the safe groundof generalities.\"Nobody vat knows,\" he said, \"could belief it.  Nobody vat knowscould belief girls\\'d go into such a life, or once dey got into itstay dere, because dey vanted to.  Vell, vat den?  Ve must find outvhy is it dey gets in und vhy dey stay.

If I canhate any man, dey is him.  It makes my red blood to steam und my skinto get all brickly to see dem or sink of dem.  But I know dot dey,too, are results of conditions, und dey sink dot dey are doingkindness to de girls by not letting dem go to chail or starve.  Devorst mens in de vorld--next to politicians as lets dem live undtakes most dot dey earn!  Und de politicians demselves are only vatdot big system as makes us all vork for less as ve earn, und makes usall pay more as ve can--only vat de big system makes dem!\"Violet understood but partially; yet she had seen enough to know thatthe slavery must have its political side, and it was concerning thisthat she now asked.That Hermann made wholly clear.  He told her the story of the growthof political parties, the development of political machines, thenecessary preying of these machines, in every city, first upongambling and then, as that passed, upon prostitution, and of how thismeant both money and votes.As he talked, she learned how this brought into being the\"cadets\"--the followers of the low heelers--who scoured their own andother towns, hanging about the doors of factories, tenements,shops--wherever the life was so hard as to drive those who lived itto despair--themselves impelled by economic conditions, by the choicebetween hard work and small pay on the one hand and base work andbetter pay on the other, and themselves forced into the \"gangs\" ofchildish marauders while at the primary schools, and so trainedupward, step by step, to the \"gang\" of the politician.  She learnedhow, after the last outcry, a popular leader had struck a cadet, inthe presence of the press-agents, and then, when this one blow wastaken as the end of the infamous relation, had quietly joined withhis fellows in strengthening that relation as it never could havebeen strengthened with the attention of the public upon it.  And shelearned how the result had been a whole criminal confederacy, withits capital in the poorer quarters, bound together politically andfinancially, with its officers, its agents, and its regularlyretained lawyers, at once to defend and to attack.Out of his own observation, Hermann told her of the saloons that werein reality the clubs of these procurers.  He sketched the methods ofprocuring false bail-bonds, of influencing magistrates, juries, andeven judges, and of turning upon the few conscientious policemen withsuits charging oppression and false arrest.\"O\\'Malley und dese ozzer mens like him ofer here make sometimes allof sixty dousand a year,\" he declared, \"und de people lofe dembecause dese O\\'Malleys take deir daughters durin\\' twelve mont\\'s undgif dem coal fur four.\"\"An\\' no one person is to blame?\" asked Violet in amazement.\"I vish dere vas, but dere ain\\'t.\"\"So there ain\\'t no way out of it?\"\"Von vay--und only von.  For de single time badness makes poverty,ninety-nine times poverty it makes badness.  Do avay vith poverty.Reorganize de whole of de industrial system; gif effery man und vomana chance to vork; gif effery man und voman effery penny dey earns.So only you do avay vith poverty, so only you do avay vith unhappyund discontented homes und unhappy und discontented people, und soonly you do avay vith badness.\"He was in the midst of his subject when Katie served the scantysupper, and he would have had neither time nor inclination for themere eating had not his sweetheart sternly ordered him to be silent.But, as soon as the meal was over and the few dishes washed, hecontinued his talk to Violet as, with the two girls ahead of her, sheleaned heavily on his arm all the way to Rivington Street.The concert was, it must be confessed, interesting chiefly to thewomen that had promoted it, the young people that took part in it,and the relatives of the performers, who succeeded or failedvicariously.  Stiffly seated in the cleared gymnasium, a littleashamed and wholly ill at ease, the audience, drawn from theneighborhood and from among the friends of the settlement-workers,bore it, however, with commendable fortitude.  They heard an amateurorchestra play \"La Paloma\" out of time; they heard Eva Aaronsohn readan essay on \"A Day in Central Park\"; they heard a promising sopranosolo spoiled by fright, and a promising baritone not yet escaped fromthe loosening leash of boyhood.  Morris Binderwitz delivered ahesitating oration upon Abraham Lincoln, as culled from his formerdebate regarding the great emancipator, and Luigi Malatesta, havingconsulted the same original sources, repeated by rote a ten-minutetribute to the military genius of George Washington.  There was aduet, a piano solo--a simplified version of \"O Du Mein HolderAbendstern.\"  Everything was conscientiously applauded, nearlyeverything was encored and then, amid a scraping of chairs and morestrains from the amateur orchestra, the ordeal came to an end.As the crowd slowly dispersed, Carrie made her way to the side of oneof the women-workers with whom she had some slight acquaintance and,after the formal catechism upon \"how she was doing,\" made her pleafor Violet.  She told, of course, nothing of the girl\\'s story, norwas anything asked.  It was enough that she should say that herfriend was fresh from the hospital, was in need of a position, and,though still weak, was able to do light housework.The woman to whom this appeal was made called Marian Lennox to herside and, with a brief explanation of what the girl had just said,introduced Carrie.\"Didn\\'t you tell me,\" she asked, \"that you\\'d heard to-day of somebodythat needed an extra servant?\"Marian had heard of such an opportunity.  The word had not come atfirst hand, and the housewife was personally unknown to her.  She wassure, however, that the place was entirely estimable, and she at oncegladly gave the address, to which her co-laborer added, upon strengthof Carrie\\'s assurances, a recommendation.Violet was brought over and presented, and when Marian saw the girl\\'swan cheeks and dull eyes, and read there the plain tokens ofsuffering, her own fine face shone with sympathy.She drew Violet aside.\"Have you ever done housework before?\" she asked.\"Only at home, ma\\'am,\" said Violet.\"Well, you\\'ll like it, I\\'m sure.  I can\\'t see why all you girls areso foolish as to go into factories.  Housework is so much morehealthy and safe, and it\\'s just what women are made for.  It pays sowell, too.  Even if you can\\'t cook, you can scrub and clean and helpand get three dollars or more a week for it, and board, too.\"\"I think I\\'ll like it,\" Violet assented, knowing in her heart thatshe would like any work that gave her a living and protection.\"Then be sure to come to see me after you\\'re settled,\" said Marian.She was now wholly immersed in the work of the settlement; but,though she had undertaken no distracting outside investigation, herindoor duties had thus far brought her into touch chiefly withchildren of the neighborhood, and from them, wise beyond their yearsas they were, she had learned only enough to feel that she had notyet come into touch with the great problems that her young heart wasso eager to answer.  In this first chance to give what she conceivedto be practical help, it seemed to her that she was at last gettingnear to the heart of what she sought.How near she had come to the heart of another problem, and how thatproblem was involved in the problem of her own life, she littleguessed as she smiled into Violet\\'s grateful face and, exactinganother promise that the girl should report to her in any difficulty,bade her good-night.XVIIIIN SERVICEThe house to which, next morning, Violet, still weak and still afraidof her enemies, made, with many timid inquiries, her slow way was inWest Ninth Street, near Sixth Avenue.  It was a four-story, grimy,brick house, with rows of prying windows through which no passer\\'seye could pierce, a dilapidated little yard in front of it, and abell-handle that, when pulled, threatened to come off in Violet\\'sfist.The woman that answered this uncertain summons much resembled thebuilding she inhabited.  She was tall, and she had a sharp face justthe color of the house-walls.  The spectacles high on her beaked nosegleamed like the windows and, like the windows, conveyed theimpression that they saw a great deal without permitting any outsiderto look behind them.  Her once formidably austere black dress wasrusty, and her hands were so lean that Violet felt sure they muststretch when one shook them.\"What do you want?\" asked this woman in a voice that cut like ameat-ax.\"Are you Mrs. Turner?\"\"Yes.  What do you want?\"\"I heard you needed a girl.\"\"Where\\'d you hear it?\"\"At the college-settlement in Rivington Street.\"The woman\\'s mouth tightened.\"Don\\'t see how anyone there come to know aught o\\' me,\" she said.\"Got a reference?\"Violet, beginning to tremble lest this chance should slip away fromher, fumbled after the note that had been written for her, andfinally found it and handed it over.Mrs. Turner\\'s gleaming glasses read it twice, plainly suspectingforgery.  Then she calmly placed it in her skirt pocket.\"Where\\'s your home?\" she next demanded.\"In Pittsburgh.\"\"Hum.  How much do you expect?\"\"Sixteen dollars,\" quavered Violet, who had received instructionsfrom Katie.Mrs. Turner shook her head vigorously.\"Won\\'t do,\" she said.  \"Can\\'t pay it.  Twelve\\'s my best, and when Ihave a cook--I\\'m out of one just now--all you have to do for it is toscrub and sweep and clean the house, wash dishes, and wait on table.How long did you stay in your last place?\"Mrs. Turner gave another skeptical \"Hum\" as Violet answered:\"Two years.\"\"Will you take it at twelve dollars, or will you not?\" asked thewoman, sharply.Violet had been told to descend gradually and not to accept a centunder fourteen dollars a month; but she was no haggler.\"I\\'ll take it,\" she said.\"And good pay, too, considerin\\',\" commented Mrs. Turner.  \"I dunno.It someways don\\'t look reg\\'lar.  Got your trunk over to thesettlement?\"Violet explained that she had no trunk; that she had just come fromthe hospital and had as yet had no opportunity to replenish what hadbeen a sadly depleted wardrobe.\"Hum!\" said Mrs. Turner.In the penetrating glare of the impenetrable spectacles she studiedthe white face before her.\"You wait a minute,\" she concluded.  \"Not inside.  Out here on thestoop.\"She came outside herself and closed and locked the door.\"I\\'ll be back soon,\" she said, and Violet dumbly watched her lank,hatless form stride to Sixth Avenue and turn the corner.True to her word, Mrs. Turner was not long gone.\"I guess it\\'s all right,\" she announced, as she reopened the door tothe house.  \"I \\'phoned that woman to the settlement.  She was out,but a friend answered and said the reference is _genuwine_.  Shedescribed you so\\'s I\\'d be sure.  Looks queer of me, p\\'r\\'aps, but aperson can\\'t be too careful in this town.\"The gleaming glasses seeming to search her soul for a reply, Violetsaid that she supposed a great deal of care was necessary.\"Try to get along without it,\" responded Mrs. Turner, \"and you\\'llmighty soon find out.\"That ended preliminaries, and Violet, agreeing to send for her fewbelongings, began work without further formality.She discovered that Mrs. Turner was a New Englander, who conducted aboarding-house in a manner that sensibly stirred the servants\\'sympathies in favor of the patrons.  Just now the season had greatlydecreased these, but the absence of the cook--it was a chronicabsence--left plenty to be done.Violet had to rise with the sun and attend to the kitchen fire.  Shehad to help the mistress in the preparation of every meal, and of theserving of every meal and the washing of all dishes she was left insolitary authority.  She made all the beds, she emptied all theslops, she swept the floors, beat the rugs, cleaned the windows,polished the stove, and scrubbed the steps.  Even in the scant hoursfree of actual work, she must still be within call of the door-belland Mrs. Turner\\'s voice: the service was continuous from dawn untilten o\\'clock at night.It would have been, upon a frailer nature, a terrible tax, but, freshthough she was from the hospital, Violet, her sturdy stock standingher in excellent stead, managed so to stagger through it that herwracked nerves seemed actually to benefit by her physical exhaustion.Her lot had all the horrors of the average disregarded under-servantand yet, when she crept to her stifling attic room at night--a roomventilated by only a dwarfed skylight--she slept soundly and well.The situation was one that could not, however, long continue.  Mrs.Turner was a pious woman and as such knew that there must be what shedescribed as \"somethin\\' sneakin\\'\" about any maid that could bear herill-temper.  Long experience of one servant after another leaving thehouse in anger, had not only innured the good lady to such losses,but had ended by really creating a sort of appetite for the kind ofcondolence that she secured from her neighbors when without servileaid.  It was therefore with almost a desire for the worst that sheendeavored to delve into Violet\\'s past.This course of innuendo, suggestion, and cross-questioning, pursuedby day and night, through work and rest, in strength and weariness,ended one afternoon when another boarder had departed, taking threetowels with him, as is the custom of departing boarders, and when, asa matter of fact, Mrs. Turner secretly felt that she could no longerafford a maid.\"Where,\" she asked, meeting Violet on the stairs, \"is them towels aswas in Mr. Urner\\'s room?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Violet.\"Well, they was there this morning, before lunch--I seen \\'emmyself--and now they hain\\'t.\"Violet recalled that Mr. Urner had been to his room in the meantimeand had then left forever.\"Hum,\" said Mrs. Turner; \"but you see the soap\\'s gone too.\"For some reason ungiven, the landlady plainly thought that the theftof the soap--perhaps because of Mr. Urner\\'s personal habits--wasproof positive that Mr. Urner could not be the thief, and that Violetmust be.  The girl was not in love with her work, but she wasimmensely comforted by the shelter it gave her, and she now throbbedwith terror at the thought of its loss.\"I didn\\'t take it, Mrs. Turner,\" she pleaded, \"honest, I didn\\'t.\"\"I didn\\'t just _say_ you did,\" replied the landlady; \"but you can\\'tblame me if I think things, the way you come here.--Where\\'d you sayyour home was?\"The question was hurled so suddenly, and was accompanied by such anuncommonly strong glare from the penetrating spectacles, thatViolet\\'s slow brain tottered.  For the life of her, she could notthink of the city that she had formerly mentioned.\"Well\"--Mrs. Turner\\'s foot beat sharply on the floor--\"that ain\\'t ahard question, is it?  Where\\'d you say you come from?\"In desperation, the girl named the first city that her lips recalled.\"Philadelphia,\" she murmured, and realized at once that this waswrong and that her tormentor knew it.\"You said Pittsburgh last week, miss,\" clicked Mrs. Turner.  Sheraised a knotty finger.  \"Now I ain\\'t sayin\\' you took that soap noryet them towels--mind you that--but I am sayin\\' you lied.  Me andliars ain\\'t good company: you\\'d better go.\"The tears came to Violet\\'s eyes.  They overflowed and she broke down.In three short sentences she had confessed enough for Mrs. Turner toguess the entire truth, and had cast herself upon the woman\\'s mercy.But Mrs. Alberta Turner\\'s straight bosom was no pillow for theunfortunate.  Rugged as it was, it was no rock of safety.  She drewher black figure to its greatest height; she called upon all herreligious experience for backing, and upon all her study of the Biblefor phraseology, and she launched at the girl a sermon the burden ofwhich was that, as she would have been glad to receive into her carea woman that had erred and had repented, so she was in Christian dutybound to cast forth and utterly repudiate one that had shown herselffar from repentance by seeking employment without first baring herinmost soul.Violet, in a word, was put upon the street.  She was told that shecould have her few possessions when she called for them, but she wasgiven neither the Rivington Street recommendation nor a new one.She had received no leisure to see her friends of the tenement or thesettlement during the days of her service, and she could not bringherself to seek them now that the black bird had again perched uponher forlorn banner.  For half an hour she wandered aimlessly throughthe quieter streets; for another half-hour she endeavored to gatherher courage.  It was three o\\'clock in the afternoon before,desperate, she had inquired of a policeman for the whereabouts of anemployment-agency, had found the grimy place, passed through thegloomy room with lines of toil-worn slatterns seated along its walls,and stated, in hesitant accents, her mission to the fat and frowzywoman in charge at a littered desk in the room beyond.That woman--she had a steady, calculating eye--looked at her victimwith a curious appraisement.\"What experience?\" she asked.\"Very little,\" admitted Violet.\"Well are you----\"  The woman\\'s voice dropped to the tone ofdiscretion.--\"Are you particular?\"\"Why no,\" said Violet sadly, \"I ain\\'t particular, so as it\\'s quiet.\"The mistress smiled sagely.\"We can fix that all right,\" said she.But she said it so knowingly that Violet found herself hurriedlyadding:\"An\\' so long as it\\'s decent.\"That it was well she had supplemented her preceding speech, she atonce perceived by the change that came over the woman\\'s face.\"Oh!\" said the woman in a tone at once uninterested.  \"Well, have youany reference?\"\"No.  You see----\"\"Never mind why.  If we get you a job, some of the girls have plenty,an\\' we can lend you one of theirs.  Go out an\\' sit down an\\' we\\'ll seewhat happens.\"Violet returned to the dark front room and took a shrinking seat in acorner among the other applicants: two lines of pasty-faced,ungainly, and not over-cleanly women.She picked up a tattered paper, dated the preceding day, and tried toread it.  She saw that the primary election had been held and thatWesley Dyker had secured one of the nominations for magistrate; butshe was tired and disgusted and pursued the print no farther,listening, instead, to the babble of gossip that was going on abouther.Had she ever heard that New York was remarkable for having a modelemployment-agency law, she would there have learned how lightly thatlaw is enforced and how much the employment-agencies of Manhattanresemble those of every other large city.  The foul beds in whichthese women slept three at a time, and for the use of which theagencies frequently charged a dollar and a half a night; theexorbitant two and three dollars exacted as a fee for every positionsecured; the encouragement given servants to make frequent changesand increase their fees; and the hard plight of maids dismissed fromservice, whose only friends, being servants themselves, had noshelter to offer--all these things were the ordinary part and parcelof their talk.The women chattered of their old employers and bandied householdsecrets from loose lip to lip.  Family skeletons were hauled forthfor merrymaking, and testimony enough to crowd a divorce-court wasgiven against not a few respectable citizens.All complained of ill-housing and loneliness.  Bad enough at anytime, the advance of the race of flat-dwellers and the decrease ofhouseholders had intensified all the evils that domestic servantshave to endure.  The best servants\\' rooms in the ordinary houseswere, it appeared, unheated; the worst were windowless closets in akitchen or alcoves in a cellar.  None of these workers had been givena room in which they could fittingly receive their friends, and, asmany of them were forbidden to have callers in the kitchen, theylived what social life was possible on afternoons or evenings \"off,\"on the streets, in the parks, or aboard those floating bar-rooms thatare called excursion-boats.  Violet remembered Fritzie; sheremembered the heavy percentage of servants that, according toHermann, ended in slavery--and she began to understand.At five o\\'clock there entered the room a pleasant-faced, stout woman,uncommonly homely, who was obviously a prospective employer.  Shelooked about her in embarrassment, and seemed uncertain where to go.Violet, beside whom the stranger was standing, rose.\"Are you lookin\\' for the office?\" she asked.  \"I\\'ll show you the way.\"The woman seemed to like her thoughtfulness and seemed, after a quickglance, to like her appearance even more.\"I am not particular about the office,\" said the newcomer; \"what Iwant is a servant.  Come outside a minute and talk to me.\"Violet followed her into the street, wondering.As they reached the pavement, the woman smiled: her smile was sopleasant that she almost ceased to be homely.\"I am a practical person,\" she said, \"and as I also loathe and detestthese agencies, I always, if possible, engage a girl so that shewon\\'t have to pay them their commissions.--Can you do generalhousework?\"\"Yes.\"\"You don\\'t look very strong.\"The girl\\'s heart throbbed.  Mrs. Turner had said that dismissal wasthe result not of what had been done but of the thing\\'s concealment.\"That\\'s only because I was ill awhile ago,\" began Violet.  \"I hadbeen in trouble----\"\"But you\\'re quite well now?\" the woman interrupted.\"Quite,\" answered Violet.She did not know how now to proceed; but the stranger, still smiling,soon gave her a chance.\"Any reference?\"\"No, ma\\'am, I haven\\'t no reference.\"\"How does that come?\"\"I was fired from my last place.\"  She took a breath, then a greaterone, and concluded: \"I was fired because the woman I worked for foundout that I had been in trouble.\"The stranger promptly ceased to smile.\"What sort of trouble?\" she inquired.Violet saw that she had made a fatal error, but she did not know howto end it except by proceeding.\"You know,\" she stammered, \"there was a man----\"The stranger raised a plump, gloved hand.\"Don\\'t tell me that,\" she said.  \"I have no right to the details.  Ithink I understand your motive, and it\\'s creditable, I must say.But, my dear, I am by no means a beautiful woman and I have a verysusceptible husband--very.  I\\'m afraid I must be going along.\"And along she went, leaving Violet in a tossing sea of emotion.  Mrs.Turner had lied, which meant the girl must lie; this later employerhad said that the woman who had been enticed was generally supposedanxious to entice others, a theory that also meant that Violet mustlie.  She returned to the agency, convinced that her error had lainonly in a lack of skill at deception.No other customers appeared during the rest of the afternoon, andwhen the agency closed its doors for the night Violet, too alarmed bythe stories she had heard to trust herself to one of its beds, soughtthe nearest policeman--she was losing her fear of policemen atlast--and had him direct her to a cheap but respectable hotel.  Shehad a little money and she paid gladly for a room that was nearlycomfortable; but she could not sleep, and she returned to theemployment-office early in the morning with red eyes and swollencheeks.Until long after noon she sat there, waiting.  She watched everyonethat entered; she looked at first eagerly and at last appealingly atevery possible employer; but somehow the woman in the inner roomnever sent for her.At last Violet herself walked through the rear door.The frowzy person with the calculating eyes looked at her sharply.\"You back?\" she asked.\"I haven\\'t left,\" said Violet.\"Why, I heard you tried to steal a customer yesterday afternoon.\"\"That wasn\\'t no customer; it was a friend of mine.\"\"Oh!  Well, what do you want now?\"\"A job.\"\"I know that.  What else?\"\"I want to give you this: I have six dollars, an\\' I\\'ll give you fivedown if you can get me a decent job in a decent house this afternoon,an\\' then I\\'ll give you two dollars a week out of my first threeweeks\\' pay.\"The frowzy person screwed her lips in a downward curve that wasprobably intended for a smile.\"I\\'ve had that percentage game handed out to me about a thousandtimes before,\" she remarked, \"an\\' I believe in such money when I getit.  Still, I don\\'t mind seein\\' that five.\"Violet produced it, and saw it swiftly vanish down a black cottonstocking.\"All right.  Tell you what I\\'ll do.  Here\\'s a woman down onWashington Square wants a maid to wait on table.  Can you do it?\"\"I can try; but of course I\\'ve never done it before.\"\"I\\'ll rent you a couple of references in the name of BellaNimick--that\\'ll cost you two dollars more, an\\' I guess I\\'ll have totrust you for it--an\\' the cook down there--she deals with us--she\\'llgive you some pointers on the job.  You\\'ll find it a good place.They\\'re old swells, an\\' the name\\'s Chamberlin.\"Violet lost no time in seeking this new address.  She found it to bea large brick house, with white marble steps, facing the leafy squarefrom the north, and looking across the broad green lawn toward achurch that towered into the blue skies by day and by night reachedup toward Heaven with a fiery cross.  The cook, to whom, through theareaway, she made her application, proved to be an ample Swedishwoman, with a heart fashioned in true proportion to her body, and around, placid face that spoke well for her mistress.That mistress, Violet was without delay informed, was an invalid,whose ills, if mostly fanciful, were at least fancied with a forcesufficient to keep her in town and in the house all summer long.  Herhusband--she had remarried after a divorce--passed the warm monthsvisiting more wealthy friends along the rocky Maine coast, and herson ran in to see her between such invitations to Newport andNarragansett as he could secure.  A daughter by the second union, agirl of sixteen, remained to care for her mother, and this child anda professional nurse, whose long service made her almost a member ofthe family, completed the household.Violet was presented to Mrs. Chamberlin, a frail woman with a white,delicate face, lying on a couch in a darkened library, and, herreferences being casually read, was promptly engaged.  She was toreceive eighteen dollars a month for far lighter work than had beenher portion under the sway of Mrs. Turner, and, as Bella Nimick,began at once to see that a better time was before her.Objections there of course were, but these were not of a sort thateither Violet\\'s previous experience or present necessity permittedher to observe.  Brought up in wealth, Mrs. Chamberlin\\'s ideals hadnot been improved by that decline of fortune consequent upon hermarriage.  Neither in a practical nor in an executive sense had shereceived any training, and, though she would have told you thathousehold management was woman\\'s true sphere, she actually knew aslittle of it as she did of the wholesale drug trade.  It had neveroccurred to her that cooking was even distantly related to chemistryand dietetics; scrubbing, dusting, and sweeping to hygiene, ordomestic administration to bookkeeping.  By the same token, the twoservants had to share a dark, narrow room in the basement, had nositting-room save the kitchen and, so far as social life went, wouldhave been, had they depended upon the Chamberlin house, twin Selkirkson a Juan Fernandez.But Violet was happy.  Her health, if it did not improve, at leastdid not noticeably decline.  The work, if it was hard, was at leastpossible of accomplishment.  And within a week she had made herselfso valuable to both her mistress and her mistress\\'s nurse that thesepotentates found continuous need of her.Then the first blow fell.She had just put away the last of the dishes from an early dinner andwas passing the barred front window of the basement when, from thesunset across the square, a shadow descended to the floor within.She looked up, startled.  In the areaway a dapper, dark, flashilydressed young man was standing, and the young man was Angel.Violet darted away from the window, but Angel, reaching through thebars, calmly raised the sash, which, even in the warmest weather, wasdrawn against the noise and dust of the street.  His dark face wasflushed, and though his wet, red lips were smiling, they smiledevilly.\"No treecks,\" he commanded.  \"You come to me.  I wanta talk.\"Violet did not answer.  She huddled into the farthest corner.\"Stan\\' out!\" continued Angel, his lips still curved.  \"You theenka meso dumb?  I am sharpa \\'nough for see you.  You come here, or I go opestairs an\\' reenga da bell.\"Slowly, like the bird advancing to the swaying serpent, she obeyedhim.\"Now,\" he said, when they were face to face, \"you alone?\"She thanked Heaven that they were.  The cook was in the kitchen.\"Poot on you\\' hat an\\' come alonga with me.\"\"I won\\'t!\" said Violet.\"You do eet!\"\"I can\\'t.  The missus won\\'t let me.  It ain\\'t my night off.\"\"Eef you don\\'t, I go ope stairs an\\' tell all abouta you.\"\"I don\\'t care.  I won\\'t go!\"\"Queeck!\"\"No.\"\"Then da woman she fire you, an\\' I get you when you come out alone.\"Violet knew that he meant it.\"Where do you want to take me?\" she asked.  \"I won\\'t let you nevertake me back to Rose\\'s.\"\"No fear,\" laughed Angel, shaking his oily curls.  \"Meess Rosie shewould not stan\\' to have you near.\"\"Then what do you want?\"\"I want you come to District Attorney\\'s, da place you go witha thatfine gentleman Dyker.  You won\\'ta be hurt.  You can peeck out any copon da way to go along, an\\' you weell knowa da place.\"\"Does he want me--that lawyer I talked to there before?\"\"I been to see him an\\' tell him we come.\"\"Then what am I to do when I get there?\"\"Taka back all you say for thata Dyke\\'.  Da\\'s all: no more--only somooch.  I won\\'t bother you no more; thata lawyer won\\'t bother you nomore; Dyker won\\'t bother you no more.  You do that, or losa da job.Wheech?\"Violet put her hand before her eyes.  She knew as well as a wiserwoman what had happened.  Angel had traced her to Katie\\'s, to thehospital, to the settlement, to the employment-agency--he wasdoubtless familiar with such places--to this house.  Rose\\'s latestcaptive had been turned out on the streets before the raid and lostto sight.  The entire white-slavery charge now rested on Violet\\'stestimony, and Angel\\'s purpose was to have her withdraw the affidavitshe had made.  In her present condition, she could not, she thought,be of any further use to him; that purpose served, he would be onlytoo glad to let her again hide herself, and, hidden here, with Dykerelected and engaged by newer cares, she might escape both friends andfoes.  Terror drove out all desire for revenge upon Rose Légère; itdrove out even the power to keep her promise to Dyker.  All that shewanted was her job.\"All right,\" she said.  \"Wait till I go upstairs and get permission.\"\"No treecks,\" cautioned Angel.  \"Eef you try treecks, I go upstair\\'myself.\"She promised, and left him, presenting to Mrs. Chamberlin in thelibrary, a moment later, a face that bore out her story of theillness of a friend.\"Well,\" said the invalid, \"if you go out I shall be certain to needyou; but I suppose there is no help for it.  Don\\'t be gone more thanan hour.\"Violet joined Angel in the area, and went with him, but, though shewas disposed toward silence, she was surprised to find the Italian ina pleasant, even a genial, mood.In his moment of success, he was well-nigh magnanimous.  He bore nota trace of malice, seeming to regard the whole matter as a game inwhich all the moves on both sides had been in accord with the rules.He chattered a variety of gossip about everything and every personsave those who were most intimately concerned in his present action,and only as they neared the office, where a light showed that theyoung assistant had remained in accordance with the word that Angelhad previously brought him, did he touch upon the matter in hand.\"No treecks, now,\" he cautioned.  \"All you gotta do ees tella heemyou were Rosie\\'s frien\\' an\\' she hit you, so you gotta drunk an\\'wanted to maka trouble.\"\"Won\\'t he be cross?\" asked Violet, her agitation returning anew.\"Naw,\" Angel reassured her.  \"He\\'s used to sucha t\\'ings.  Don\\'forgot, an\\' I give you five doll\\'.\"They entered the office that Violet just recalled as having visitedwith Dyker in her fever-dream.  At a desk, covered with neatlyarranged piles of papers sat the young assistant, who, having thenseen her red with illness, and now seeing her still white from itsrecovery, might well suppose that their first meeting was the resultof drunken malice.\"Here she ees,\" smiled Angel, \"like I promise.  She ees a gooda girlnow, an\\' sorry she tell you da deeferent story an\\' maka trouble.\"Angelelli had told Violet the truth: the young man was indeed used tosuch things--so used to them that he knew protest was fruitless andthat his inquiry must be formal.\"You want to withdraw your deposition?\" he asked.  He was a kindlyyoung man with a thin face.\"Do I what?\" asked Violet.\"He means----\" began Angel.\"I mean,\" interrupted the lawyer, \"do you want to take back the storyyou told me about Rose Légère?  This case is on the calendar forto-morrow, so if you mean to take back what you said, you had betterdo it now.\"\"It won\\'t get me into no trouble?\"The young man raised his eyebrows.\"What would be the use?\" he inquired.  \"No, it won\\'t get you into anytrouble.\"\"Then I\\'ll take it back,\" said Violet.\"You\\'ll have to be sworn, you know.\"\"She don\\' minda that,\" said Angel.  \"Do you, Violet?\"The girl shook her head, and a clerk was called and administered anoath so rapidly that Violet could understand no word of it.\"You\\'re doing this of your own free will--just because you want to?\"resumed the lawyer, donning his professional air, and seeming tobecome infected with the clerk\\'s rapidity of utterance.  \"You are notswayed by any promise of pecuniary reward--that is because you\\'repaid for it?  And there has been no force or threat used to compelyou to do it--I mean you haven\\'t been told you\\'d be hurt if youbacked down?\"Violet bowed in token of a desire to answer these questions inwhatever way was necessary to her bargain, and the new depositionproceeded in the same manner and along the lines that Angel had laiddown.  The clerk hurried because he wanted to get home; the lawyerhurried because he thoroughly disbelieved every word that waswritten; and, severe as Violet had feared that the ordeal would be,it was over far sooner than she had expected.Angel, still loyal to his word, saw her safely home.\"Now,\" he said, as he left her at the areaway, \"nobody weell ever anymore bother you.  Good-night.\"He raised his hat and went away, but, as he turned, he pressed intoher cold hand a crisp, new bill.Violet\\'s fingers closed about it silently.  She had earned it.XIX\"FIAT JUSTITIA RUAT CAELUM\"The trial of Rose Légère was precisely the farce that Violet hadexpected and that Angel had planned.  In ninety of such cases out ofevery hundred, the chief witnesses for the state are suppressed byfear or force, and the prosecution collapses.  Thus, in the presentinstance, had not the newspapers made first-page announcements of theLégère woman\\'s arrest and so attracted to the case the momentaryattention of an effervescing moral public, the District Attorney\\'soffice would, in fact, have contented itself with submitting theindictment and asking for a verdict of not guilty.With Violet in the hospital during the session of the Grand Jury,Wesley, now a man of power, had been able to refresh Larry Riley\\'smemory to such a point that, in the hands of the prosecutor, thepoliceman\\'s evidence was sufficient to insure the finding of a truebill; but when the case was called for trial the situation was vastlychanged.  The girl that had followed Violet into the net had beencast back into the sea of the city and utterly swallowed up.  Violetherself had recanted.  The elder inmates of the Légère establishmentregarded the law as their natural enemy and, had they been disposedto assist it, could in no wise have been regarded as crediblewitnesses.  The action had, therefore, to rest entirely upon Riley\\'stestimony, and for Riley\\'s testimony there was virtually nocorroboration procurable.\"You\\'re a good thing--I don\\'t think,\" remarked the weary-faced youngAssistant District Attorney as, on the morning of the trial, he metDyker in the corridor of the court.  \"We shoved this case about fiveyears ahead on the calendar to please you, and the night before it\\'scalled your witness comes to my office and eats her deposition.\"Wesley had already heard that piece of news.  When, in order to keepan eye upon Violet, he had, some time previously, sought her atKatie\\'s tenement, and had received a series of uncredited vows to theeffect that the Irish girl had no idea of the whereabouts of her latecharge, he had begun to look for a recantation.  It was the sort ofgame that he had himself frequently played, and he blamed his ownlack of foresight in not better providing against it.  Then otherinterests had arisen.  The campaign came on apace; there were newerenemies than Rose to be dealt with, and, when the wires leading fromthe District Attorney\\'s office had informed him that the expected hadoccurred, he received the word with calm philosophy.\"Well,\" he carelessly laughed in reply to the young assistant\\'ssally, \"that\\'s always the way: we elect you people into your jobs andthen you think that we ought to get up your cases for you and holdyour witnesses.\"He went on his way, unconcerned.  Scarcely less concerned, the youngassistant, knowing that his cause was lost, proceeded into court witha solemn air calculated to convince an outraged public morality ofhis high intent; challenged juror after juror with a frowning brow;outlined his case with biting logic; examined Riley, as the officeron the beat, together with the other policemen that had made thearrest, in an heroic style eminently pleasing to the reporters;finally worked himself into a profuse perspiration of Ciceronianinvective against the prisoner and, mopping his weary face, sat down.Equally without concern, and knowing his cause was won, counsel forthe defense, a suave little personage, played his rôle as the cuescame to him: retained his suavity through an opening statement flatlydenying that of his learned young friend; pretended to drop a littleof the suavity through a series of cutting cross-examinations thatleft nothing of the policeman\\'s vague testimony; and gave anexcellent imitation of throwing away all the rest of the suavitywhen, in an impassioned speech, quite up to that of his learned youngfriend, he declared that he would call no witness (which he did notdare to do), because the Commonwealth had wholly failed to make outits case (which was quite true), and because a respectable lady, thedaughter of a mother, had been outraged by ruffianly officers, herhumble home ruthlessly wrecked, and her livelihood endangered (whichwas absolutely false).So, at last, without any pretense at concern whatever, thebottle-nosed personage on the bench ceased drawing pigs on hisblotter, and, sharing the common knowledge of the fate of the case,gravely instructed the unwashed jury that if they thought two and twowere four they should so find, whereas if, on the other hand, theybelieved four to be the sum of one and one plus one and one they wereto perform their sworn duty and so report.  And the unwashed jury,without leaving the court-room, declared Rose Légère an innocentwoman.The innocent woman, still the pleasantly stout lady of the breweryadvertisement, shook gratefully the soft paw of her forensic defender.\"Thank God that\\'s over,\" said she, with quite as much feeling andquite as much reason as many others of us return praise to Heaven forbenefits that originate a good deal nearer earth.The suave defender smiled.\"Yes,\" he said, \"thank God--and pay _me_.\"\"You\\'ll get a check in the morning,\" Rose replied, \"an\\' I haven\\'t agrudge against nobody, though I do think that other lawyer might \\'a\\'got less gay with his tongue.\"\"He was only doing his duty, Mrs. Légère.  It\\'s the law, you know.\"\"What if it is?  I didn\\'t make it.  What I don\\'t like to see is theway you people\\'ll go back on your friends because somethin\\' orother\\'s the law.\"She gathered her silk skirts free of contamination by the low crowdin the court-room, and made her way to a waiting taxicab outside.\"I think,\" she said, as that vehicle began to pump through thestreets, \"I\\'ll pay a little call on Mr. Wesley Dyker.\"She found him, somewhat surprised beneath his drooping lids, at hisoffice, and he immediately agreed to see her alone.\"Now then,\" she said pleasantly, seating herself unasked before hisdesk and leaning easily back in her chair, \"what I want to know is:Am I goin\\' to be let alone?\"Dyker stroked his crisp mustache.  He wanted to gain time.\"You were acquitted, then?\" he asked.\"Looks like it, don\\'t it?  See here, Wes, I know where all my troublecome from, an\\' I can pretty well guess how it come; but I\\'m willin\\'to ferget it if you are.  Are you?\"Dyker\\'s slow eyes were raised to hers, then lowered.\"Yes,\" he said.\"All right.  Now you\\'ll need me an\\' I\\'ll lend a hand, but I\\'ve got toknow first off if I\\'m not goin\\' to be interfered with.\"\"You had better see O\\'Malley about that.\"\"No, I hadn\\'t.  You went to see him first; go to him again.\"\"I----\"  Dyker twirled a pencil between his white fingers.  \"I shan\\'tbe sorry if I do?\"\"You will not.\"\"I may count on that, may I?\"Rose squared herself in her chair.\"Got a talkin\\'-machine around here?\" she inquired.\"Why, no.\"\"Because I\\'d like to have some soft music while I tell you the storyof my life--see?\"\"I don\\'t believe you have to tell that.\"\"Yes, I do.  I want you to know just what I am; then you\\'ll seewhether you can depend on me.  I was brought up decent--that\\'s thetruth.  I had my church an\\' Sunday-school like you had, an\\' perhapsmore.  The other sort of school I had to quit early, because my oldman wasn\\'t paid enough to keep me on, an\\' I had to go to work myself.I was under the age; but I swore I wasn\\'t, so that was all right, an\\'after I\\'d tramped over the whole town, I got a job filin\\' letters an\\'addressin\\' circulars in a young broker\\'s office.  I was mightylittle, but I was mighty good lookin\\'.  I thought he took me for whatI could do, but I found out he took me for my looks.\"She spoke quite without emotion, and Dyker, in spite of himself, wasinterested.\"It cost that broker a lot to live,\" she continued; \"so much that hecouldn\\'t afford to get married.  When he\\'d got through with me, aftera few years, an\\' the baby was dead in the hospital, my people were sodamned respectable that I didn\\'t dare go home to them.  Wall Streethad been plungin\\'; nobody\\'d buy stocks; I couldn\\'t get a job there.Times was hard and I couldn\\'t find a place anywhere else.  It was upto me to starve to death, go into a home an\\' be marked for life, orget real money the best way I could.\"She paused, and Wesley found himself interjecting an urging \"Well?\"\"Well, I got the money.  My broker put me up in a flat.  He stole thecash to do it, an\\' when the fly-cops got next, he blew out hisbrains.  I was still high and dry, so I got a couple of girls to helpme.  Then I met Mike O\\'Malley\\'s brother--the one that\\'s dead now--an\\'he squared things for me so\\'s I could open up the place you knew.  Heowned my joint an\\' was right an\\' regular.  He saw to it I wasn\\'tbothered, an\\' we paid for protection an\\' furnished an address whenhis brother needed one for voters.  I never had no trouble \\'tillO\\'Malley\\'s brother was dead an\\' you queered me with Mike himself.\"\"And is that all?\"\"Yes, that\\'s all.  It\\'s about what you\\'d learn from any other womanin my line of work.  But I\\'ll tell you one thing: I got my girlshowever I could--a lot of \\'em because your friends brought \\'em, an\\'everyone that was brought that way I paid for, fair an\\' square an\\'good an\\' heavy; I had to keep the women down because expenses was sohigh; but no man was ever cheated in my place, an\\' no man was everrobbed with my knowledge.  I may have bad habits of my own, even formy sort of a life; but I always treat my customers on the level, an\\'I always see that my girls treat \\'em on the level, too.\"\"What about the hangers-on?\" asked Wesley.\"You mean about Angel?  Well, I played double because I didn\\'t knowwho was goin\\' to be on top, an\\' in this business you\\'ve always got tobe on the winnin\\' side.  Now you are on top an\\' there can\\'t be noquestion.  I\\'m in this line because I\\'ve got to live; I couldn\\'t donothin\\' else; an\\' I\\'m goin\\' to keep on in it as long as I live.  Yousee now that I\\'ve always been on the level in one way; you see that Ihaven\\'t no reason now not to be on the level in the other way.--Willyou go an\\' fix it with O\\'Malley?\"He did fix it.  He fixed it that afternoon, and he fixed it so firmlythat, within ten days, Rose, with her former minions gathered fromthe corners where she had hidden them, was living and prospering inthe house that Riley had raided.Impartial Justice had been satisfied.XXTHE SANCTITY OF THE HOMEDestiny, busy as she had been with the affairs of Rose Légère, hadnot neglected the usually serene residence of Mrs. Ferdinand WappingChamberlin.  For ten hours the invalid herself had been fretful.This had reacted upon the gentle nature of Mistress Madelaine, whohad in turn made the nurse to suffer, and the nurse, in her ownphrase, had \"taken it out on\" Lena Johnson, the Swedish cook.\"An\\' it\\'s all ban because that son of another husband ban comin\\'home,\" said the naturally good-tempered Lena, in an effort to passalong the general discontent to Violet.\"What of that?\" Violet asked.  \"Is he home so seldom that we\\'ve gotto get the whole house ready for him?\"It appeared from Lena\\'s answer that the young man was home far morefrequently than his mother\\'s finances could well afford.  When hehonored the Chamberlin roof with his presence, he generally managedto secure all the money within reach and to devote that money tosociological researches that kept him out until the lesser hours ofthe morning.  These stubborn pursuits were, it seemed, highlydisapproved of by both his mother and his sister, yet both his motherand his sister hated his father, the divorced husband of theremarried Mrs. Chamberlin; and as the son and brother constantlythreatened that any interference would result in a transfer of hisaffectionate borrowings to the bank-account of his sire, both womenwere, during his intermittent residence with them, torn between theirimprobation of his pursuits and their fear that he would desert thematernal house for the paternal club.\"What\\'s his name?\" asked Violet, as she lent a hand at thepreparation of dinner.\"Philip,\" answered Lena, \"an\\' it ought to be Hungry Haakon.\"And yet, when the prodigal reached the house that evening and,admitting himself with his own latchkey, hurried into the librarywhere his mother and sister, the former on the couch and the latterseated beside it, were awaiting the announcement that dinner wasserved, he would not have appeared, to any stranger that could seehim, a much worse young man than most young men.\"Hello!\" he cried, kissing both women lightly on the cheek.  \"Sistermore of a lure for susceptible hearts than ever!\"\"Much chance _I_ have!\" murmured black-eyed Madelaine, brushing asidea careful blonde curl disordered by his onslaught.\"And the _Mutter_ getting better every day,\" pursued the unabashedyouth.\"Your mother,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, her heavy brows rising almost tothe level of her lace cap, \"will never be herself again, and you wellknow it.\"\"Poof!  A lean horse for a long race, _Mutter_.\"Mrs. Chamberlin waved a thin hand in dismissal of all discussion.\"If you mean to dress for dinner,\" she said, \"you had better begin,Philip.\"\"No use.  I have an engagement for to-night in circles where eveningclothes are rarely considered quite proper, and I washed up at theclub.\"\"Oh, then you stopped there before coming to your home?\"\"It was on my way.\"\"And you of course saw that terrible man?\"This being the term in which Mrs. Chamberlin habitually referred tothe husband that had been so wicked as to permit her, after herelopement with Chamberlin, to institute and win a suit for divorce,her son merely nodded.\"But what\\'s the use of bothering about that?\" he demanded.  \"It wason the way, I tell you.  Cheer up: one may smile and smile and be awoman still.\"But his hearers, by way of response to this advice, sighed audibly.\"I don\\'t think it was very considerate of you, Philip,\" vouchsafedthe younger.  \"You must remember that when you got that last checkfrom mother----\"\"Madelaine!\" cautioned Mrs. Chamberlin.\"I don\\'t care, dear.  Philip, you must remember that when you gotthat last check from mother, it was on your distinct promise that youwould not see your father again for a year.\"\"And don\\'t you remember,\" retorted Philip, \"that I afterwards, uponreflection, distinctly withdrew that distinct promise as utterly andin essence unfilial?  A woman can always remember more things than aman has forgotten, and forget whatever she doesn\\'t want to remember.If it had been an honest woman instead of an honest man that Diogeneswas looking for, he\\'d have had to throw away his lantern and hire aportable lighthouse.\"But he kissed the girl as he said this, and pressed his mother\\'s hand.\"The trouble with you two,\" he declared, \"is that you don\\'t get aboutenough.  Seclusion makes you serious.\"\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, \"that you had brought me back thenews that you had grown more like us.\"\"More serious?  Still harping on your son, dear!  No, I\\'m sorry todisappoint you, but I\\'ve about given up all hope of marrying money,and marrying anything else is an impossibility.  I must be getting onin years.  You know how it is: as we grow older we become moreparticular and less desirable--when we\\'re old enough to have learnedproperly to play the game of love, we\\'re too old to play it.\"\"You\\'re a mere boy,\" observed Madelaine, with a toss of her blondecurls.\"And you talk like one,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, smiling in spite ofherself.\"I\\'d never think of accepting anybody so young as you are,\" the girladded.Philip pulled her pink ear.\"That\\'s right, Queen Mab,\" he agreed; \"wait till a man is large andround and settled.  And when you do marry, marry for keeps: a littlemarriage is a dangerous thing, eh, _Mutter_?\"\"Philip!\"What more she would have said to this criticism of her own estate,Mrs. Chamberlin\\'s son was not just then to hear, for a Japanese gonginterrupted her with the melodious announcement of dinner, and theson snatched his protesting mother in his arms and, with Madelainefollowing, bore her into the brightly lighted dining-room.He looked at the shining silver and gleaming linen and glass andchina, and he saw the pale liquid that filled one of the glasses athis own accustomed place.\"Good!\" he cried.  \"I hope Lena\\'s hand has not forgotten its cunning.Stolen waters are sweet, but the best cocktail is a dry one.\"And then, with his living burden still in his strong arms, he lookedacross the table and into the eyes of the new servant.The new servant, from the shadow, returned that gaze.  She saw beforeher, in the person of her employer\\'s son, Philip Beekman, theblack-haired, gray-eyed young waster that had once promised her helpin the house of Rose Légère.  On her part, Violet could have nodoubt, and it was only with the utmost exercise of self-control thatshe continued her duties.  But for Philip certainty was notimmediately obtainable.  He saw many girls in the surroundings inwhich he had first seen Violet, and her he would probably long sincehave forgotten had it not been for the appeal that she had made tohis surface emotions.  Nevertheless, the walls of his own home didnot, in this case, form a setting that made for easy identification,and, besides, though this woman had recovered some degree of herhealth, the best of her looks would never return.  Beauty is thequality most remembered by such men as Philip Beekman, and beautylost is the best disguise against them.  Philip, therefore, quietlydeposited his mother in her chair, and continued his easy railleryuntil the soup had been served and the little family had been left,for a time, alone.\"New maid?\" he then casually inquired.\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Chamberlin, \"and actually a fairly competent one.\"\"What\\'s her name?\"\"Bella.\"\"Any more?\"\"Really, I don\\'t recall her family name, Philip.  What possibledifference can it make?\"\"I suppose,\" said Madelaine, \"that he thinks her pallor interesting.\"\"Nonsense, Madelaine!\"\"Her last name is Nimick, Philip.\"\"Oh!\" said Philip, inwardly reflecting that, in the nature of things,a name could not much signify.  \"I was merely attracted by the factthat she didn\\'t precisely resemble a servant.  Have you never noticedhow all men look as if they belonged to the class below their own,and all women to the class above?  It seems as if a man could neverrise above his environment, and as if a woman could never descend tohers.\"He did not again refer to the subject, but the subject was, duringall the meal, keenly conscious that his gray eyes were covertlywatching her.  She moved about the room with increasing difficulty.Her hand shook as she brought the salad-bowl, and she spilled some ofhis coffee on the cloth.As soon as Lena had left the kitchen and gone upstairs, Beekman cameinto the pantry.  His manner, neither that which she had once knownnor that which she had more lately observed, was quick andthreatening; his frank face was flushed with anger.\"Your name is Violet,\" he said in a voice that, though low, shookunder the restraint that he put upon it.She was standing beneath a gas-jet, a little column of dishes in herhand.  The cruel light showed the havoc that had been wrought uponher, but it also showed the marks that no years or change could alter.\"Yes,\" she said, her own voice scarce a whisper.\"Did you----\" he bit his lip.  \"Did you come here to scare me?\" hedemanded.She put down the dishes.\"What do you mean, Mr. Beekman?\"\"Because I haven\\'t any money, you know.\"\"Mr. Beekman!\"She put her hand before her face, and he saw that he had been wrong.\"I beg your pardon,\" he sulkily said.  \"In the circumstances, itwasn\\'t an unnatural supposition, though my mother thoroughlyunderstands my manner of life; but I see now that I shouldn\\'t havesaid it.\"He paused, and then, because he hated to be in the wrong, he huntedabout for another excuse for attack, and, finding one, became moreangry than before.\"Only how dared you,\" he asked, \"how did you dare to come into thishouse?\"Violet bowed her russet head.\"I didn\\'t know it was yours,\" she said.\"You didn\\'t know?\"\"How could I?  Lena didn\\'t happen to say nothin\\' about you beforeto-day, an\\' your mother has a different name.\"\"Don\\'t talk of my mother!\" he commanded.Had Violet known all the truth of her mistress, it would probablyhave flashed over even the servant\\'s dull brain that the differencebetween a woman beaten into slavery and a woman that married the manwho, during her first marriage, had been her lover, was a differencenot of kind, but of degree, and of a degree decidedly in the ethicalfavor of the former.  However, she held her tongue.It was the best shield she could have chosen.  Through silence fewfits of anger are strong enough to reach, and the quick temper ofBeekman began slowly to spend itself.\"I don\\'t see how you could come into any decent house,\" he grumbled,\"no matter whether you knew whose it was or not.\"Still Violet did not answer.\"I suppose you didn\\'t think about that, though,\" Philip pursued.Violet was as yet too stunned at all adequately to feel.  With ashaking finger she drew invisible arabesques upon the shelf besideher.\"How did you get away from Rose\\'s, anyhow?\" he asked.Slowly she raised her head.  Slowly she fixed him with her tired blueeyes.  And slowly, still drawing arabesques now unregarded, sheanswered:\"Does that make much difference, Mr. Beekman?\"\"Wasn\\'t I interested?\" he blustered.\"Because, you see,\" she concluded, \"however it was, it wasn\\'t by noneof the help you promised.\"The thrust just pierced his armor of convention.\"Oh, well,\" he said, \"what could I do?  I wanted to help--you knowthat--but what could I do?\"\"Nothin\\'!\"  Her eyes clouded as if they looked at something which,though clear to sight, passed all explaining.  \"Nothin\\', I suppose.\"The words lent him courage.\"And I can\\'t do anything now,\" he went on, his anger cold, but hisdetermination unchanged.  \"I\\'m sorry for you--on my word of honor, Iam sorry for you with my whole heart, Violet--but you can\\'t stayhere--you must see that you can\\'t stay in this house another night.\"Her eyes were still on his.\"I know you think that,\" she replied, as if puzzled and seeking asolution.  \"An\\' I know what you think goes.--But, myself, I can\\'t seewhy not.\"\"But, Violet, just consider!\" he cried, his hands outstretched.\"You wanted me to get away an\\' get a decent job,\" she dully answered.\"Not here.\"\"What\\'s the difference?  What\\'s the difference whether it\\'s here orsomewheres else?  I can\\'t see.\"\"But here all the time I should know.\"\"Don\\'t you know, wherever you are, about lots of others that don\\'tget away?  An\\' does that hurt you?  Wouldn\\'t you know about mewherever you are, about me wherever I went?  An\\' would that hurt me?\"\"You don\\'t understand!\"He seemed to charge her with her admitted incomprehension as if itwere a crime.\"No, I don\\'t,\" she repeated.\"Can\\'t you see that if you were somewhere else, it would bedifferent?\"\"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t.\"\"Not if you were where nobody knew about you?\"\"No, I don\\'t see that, Mr. Beekman.  I haven\\'t got any disease togive people.\"\"I wasn\\'t thinking that.\"\"Well, you wouldn\\'t tell on me to the people I went to if I wentsomewheres else?\"\"Certainly I wouldn\\'t.\"\"An\\' you don\\'t think I\\'d steal, do you?\"\"Of course not.\"\"Nor--nor get anybody who was kind to me into the sort of a hell Iworked so hard to get myself out of?\"\"How could I think it?  What are you driving at, Violet?\"\"This: that if all them things is the way you say, I\\'m fit for anyjob I\\'m able to do--an\\' I\\'m able to do this one.\"\"Not in this house.\"\"What\\'s the difference where?\"  Her voice was still low, and herwords still came slowly; but she was, however imperfectly andpainfully, beginning to think--which is a very dangerous thing in anyexploited individual.  \"What\\'s the difference where?\" she asked.\"What you know don\\'t make me no worse, an\\' what I know don\\'t make meno better.  The truth\\'s the truth.  What\\'s happened\\'s happened.  Iused to be a girl in Rose\\'s house, no matter if I was now workin\\' inyour house an\\' you do know what I used to be.  Wherever I am, I\\'mwhat I am; your knowin\\' it don\\'t help or hinder; an\\' if I\\'m fit fornext door I\\'m fit for here.\"Philip Beekman passed his long fingers through his black hair.  Itwas the gesture she had seen him employ on that remembered night atRose\\'s, but now it had a new significance.  The young man was as muchthe creature of his surroundings as Violet was the creation of hers.He could no more appreciate her point of view than she couldcomprehend his.  It was as if they spoke different tongues.  Beekmanwas powerless to argue further, and when a man reaches thatcondition, he takes a firm stand upon authority.\"All right,\" he said; \"we won\\'t waste words.  The hard fact is thatyou\\'ve got to go.  I\\'m sorry, but you\\'ve got to go and go now.\"She bowed her head; she had finished.He wished she would answer; he wished she would fly into a rage; butas she remained dumb, he continued:\"I suppose your hat and jacket are in the kitchen.  You can drop me acard telling me where to send your trunk.  I\\'ll explain this toyour--to my mother somehow.  I\\'ll do whatever I can for you--outside.\"A slow shake of her russet head was her reply.\"I\\'ll give you a recommendation.\"\"I won\\'t need none, Mr. Beekman.\"\"I--I think I\\'ve got fifty dollars somewhere in my clothes.\"\"I was paid my wages only this mornin\\'.\"He looked at her in gray-eyed amazement.\"But I say,\" he began, \"you aren\\'t going to--you don\\'t mean youwon\\'t----\"She did not answer.  She moved slowly and quietly away.  She went tothe kitchen, got her shabby beaver hat and her long coat.Philip, in the pantry, remained as she had left him, erect, eyes andmouth wide.A moment later he heard the area door open and close.XXIAN ANCIENT PROBLEM\"An twent\\' from Rosie Légère\\'s,\" said Angel, \"maka two hundre\\'.\"Hermann Hoffmann, alone behind the bar in Schleger\\'s saloon, and halfasleep as he bent over a thumbed and stained copy of the lastevening\\'s paper, scarcely raised his head.  It was half-past oneo\\'clock in the morning.  Except for Angelelli and the man to whom hewas talking at a table by the door, the place was empty of customers,and so unconcerned were these two late-comers that, had he wished it,every word of their conversation could have been taken down by thebar-keeper.But the bar-keeper did not wish it.  He knew both the men, and hadheard something of the character of each, as every good bar-keepercomes to know and to hear about most of the regular patrons of theestablishment that employs him.  With Angel he had even had a noddingacquaintance in the days of the brewery-wagon, and since he haddonned the white jacket he had seen often the narrow-chested,stoop-shouldered, slouching Austrian now in conference with thedapper Rafael.  He had been told that this Austrian, with hisbristling brown hair, pale face, and thin mouth, pulled downward atone corner by an ugly scar, made his regular living by appropriatingthe wages of a girl that he nightly drove forth to scour the darkstreets, earning what money she could from what looks were left herand stealing what she could not earn.  And Hermann knew that, now anelection was near, both of these proud possessors of the suffragewere doing their exacted duty for the powers that permitted them tothrive, and were, like the army of others in their own profession,through all New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, through thetenderloin of every American city, providing for the voting ofrepeaters, of dead men, of men that never were, in the interests ofwhichever of the two great political parties happens to be in controlof the city where such votes are needed.\"Mirka,\" said Angel, laying down his gold-rimmed fountain-pen andlooking up from the back of the envelope on which he had been makinghis calculations, \"we weell need a hundre\\' more.\"Mirka, the Austrian, tried to smile, but that ugly scar at the cornerof his mouth caught the smile in the making and pulled it down into asinister sneer.\"I can smoke out fifty if you can,\" he said.\"Da sama kind?\"\"Yes.\"Hermann, behind the bar, frankly yawned.  He remembered, with a slowsmile, how, when he had first come across such practices, years ago,he had gone to the ward-leader of that party in whose interests thework was being done.  He remembered how this potentate had firstassured him that he had \"heard wrong,\" and finally met hispersistence with a warning that he had better keep his mouth shut.He remembered how, at the rival headquarters, he had been told thatthere was always a mass of such evidence, none of which could beeffectively used before election, and how, when he had ventured tosuggest that an election-offense was punishable after election-day,he had been ridiculed.  And lastly, he knew that his own Socialistfriends had already all the information that he had now obtained, butcould do no more at the polls than lodge protests that would beoverruled by the election-judges and subsequently pigeon-holed by thecourts.\"All right,\" Angel was saying, as he pocketed his pen and tore theenvelope into small bits, which he tossed deftly across the room intothe gutter beneath the bar.  \"I feexa heem.  I geta da rest.\"The two men rose and stepped to the bar for a nightcap of whiskey.Already the Austrian had drunk more than was good for his temper, butHermann, whose eye was usually exact in discerning such matters, wassleepy to-night, and did not notice this.  Angel poured a bountifulportion from the cool metal-stoppered bottle that Hoffmann shovedclanking toward him.  Mirka decanted even more, and then momentarilyreleased his hold of the bottle to speak to his companion.  Hermann,thinking both men satisfied, reached for the liquor.\"Keep your dirty fingers off of that!\" cried Mirka, with no trace ofhis nationality in his speech.  \"Can\\'t you wait till I pour a realman\\'s drink?\"Hermann flushed.\"It\\'s a bath, den, you\\'re goin\\' to dake?\" he asked.\"I will if I like, you damned fool!\" rejoined Mirka, his eyes warming.Hermann\\'s blue glance surveyed the uncouth, slouching figure.\"All righd,\" he said; \"you need von.\"The Austrian glowered.  Then, tilting back his bristling head, hetossed the liquor down his long throat.\"Give me another, you Dutchie,\" he ordered, pushing his glass acrossthe bar.Angel began a quieting word, but Mirka broke in, still addressingHermann.\"Get a move on, or I\\'ll break yer face, Dutchie!\" he insisted.Hermann\\'s jaw was suddenly set in a rigid line.  He remainedmotionless.\"Come on, now!\" said Mirka.\"Don\\' maka these treecks,\" protested Angelelli, dividing his pleabetween his hearers, and placing his hand upon the Austrian\\'sshoulder.\"You shut up!\" retorted Mirka, shaking himself free.  \"And you, youDutch fool, give me a drink--quick!\"Hermann did not obey.  He saw at last the fellow\\'s condition.\"You\\'ve had enough,\" he said.\"Mind yer own business,\" snapped the Austrian.\"Dot\\'s what I\\'m doing,\" answered Hermann, calmly reaching for theempty glasses.  \"You\\'re drunk.\"He had hardly spoken before Mirka, his habitual lassitude droppingfrom him like a discarded cloak, made a quick leap that brought himhalf across the bar.  The glasses crashed, the bottle was overturned,and in the Austrian\\'s waving, clenched right hand there flashed aknife.It was a moment of action, but a moment only.  From one side of thebar, Angel had gripped Mirka by the waist and was pulling himbackward; on the other, the powerful German had caught thethreatening fist and now, with a quick twist, sent the knife plunginginto the tub below the beer-spigots.Spluttering obscenities, the Austrian was dragged to the positionfrom which he had made his attack.\"You keepa quiet!\" commanded Angel of the one combatant, and to theother: \"You getta more fresh with your mouth an\\' I getta you fired.\"Hermann had recovered the knife and was now calmly drying it upon abar-towel.  Such incidents were not unusual in his occupation and,now that this one was closed, he could afford to smile his answer toRafael.Mirka, on the other hand, though still tightly embraced by Angel, wastrembling with rage.\"I\\'ll get you for this, Dutchie!\" he declared.\"So?\" said Hermann.  He still smiled, but he was tired of beingcalled Dutchie, and his tongue ran just a hair\\'s breadth ahead of hiscaution.  \"Try it,\" he concluded; \"try it, you dirty Austrian loafer,und I\\'ll somevheres go vhere dose names you\\'ve been makin\\' oud villget you vhat you deserve.\"\"Whata you say?\" Angel kept his hold upon his friend, but thereference to their recent occupation brought a glint of anger intohis own eyes.By way of beginning his reply, Hermann smilingly returned the knifeto its owner, who seized it with a growl of malice.\"Neffer mind vhat I say den,\" he answered.  \"Vhat I say now is\\'Goot-nighd.\\'  You two get oud.\"He raised his thick arm to point to the door, but in the manner ofits raising there was another significance.  For a moment Angel andMirka met hotly his steady gaze.  Then the bar-keeper raisedcarelessly his other hand: it held a stout bung-starter.The two men, with a common impulse, turned and silently left theplace.Hermann was not afraid of them.  He knew that his threat of betrayalhad been idle, for the excellent reason that there was no quarter inwhich betrayal would be effective, and he told himself that, as soonas their anger and their drunkenness had in some measure subsided,the plotters would recognize this.  So he whistled complacently as hepolished the bright surface of the bar and did not hesitate, when hebegan at last to wash and put away the glasses, to turn his back tothe swinging door of the saloon.  The campaign was not one that wasconsidered important and, personally, he cared but little about it orwhat enmities it might awaken.The campaigners cared, however, a great deal.  There was in no sanemind any question of the result, but so mighty is custom that therewere few sane minds that did not publicly pretend to be in doubt uponthe issue.For many days previously, any outsider, reading the newspapers orattending the mass-meetings in Cooper Union and Carnegie Hall, wouldhave supposed that a prodigious battle was waging and that the resultwould be, until the last shot, in doubt.  There were terriblescareheads, brutal cartoons, and extra editions.  As the real problemwas whether one organization of needy men should remain in control,or whether another should replace it, there were few matters ofpolicy to be discussed; and so the speechmaking and the printingresolved themselves into personal investigations, and attacks uponcharacter.  Private defectives were hired, records searched,neighbors questioned, old enemies sought out, and family feudsrevived.  Desks were broken open, letters bought, anonymouscommunications mailed, boyhood indiscretions unearthed, and women andmen hired to wheedle, to commit perjury, to entrap.  Whatever wasdiscovered, forged, stolen, manufactured--whatever truth or falsehoodcould be seized by whatever means--was blazoned in the papers,shrieked by the newsboys, bawled from the cart-tails at the cornersunder the campaign banners, in the light of the torches and beforethe cheering crowds.  It would all be over in a very short while; ina very short while there would pass one another, with pleasantsmiles, in court, at church, and along Broadway, the distinguishedgentlemen that were now, before big audiences, calling one anotheradulterers and thieves; but it is customary for distinguishedgentlemen so to call one another during a manly campaign in thissuccessful democracy of ours, and it seems to be an engrossingoccupation while the chance endures.Though he often trembled, Wesley Dyker, perhaps because his recordsof any sort were as yet but brief, escaped with a fairly clean skinthis Yahoo discharge, but the downpour continued all about him withtremendous vigor and at tremendous cost.  The Republican leaders,fully expecting defeat, assessed their supporters just as heavily asif they were certain to triumph, spent much time and more money andno end of breath.  The Reformers, under varying factional names,bewildered, sometimes advisedly, the independent voter by herejoining one leading party, there endorsing another, and in a thirdplace clamoring for a ballot so split and so subdivided that theaverage man could in no wise comprehend it when marked.  TheSocialists, to be sure, went along calmly enough, confessing theirnumerical weakness and securely seeing in the small increase of thepresent day the promise of the large majority of the distant morrow.But all the while the Democratic organization thundered an inchforward in the light and ran a mile forward in the darkness byprecisely the same powers as were invoked, with so much smallerresults, by the Republicans and the Reformers.Not that there was any reason to doubt the organization\\'s victory.There was none.  But every organization always insists that, nomatter how easy the skirmish, its leaders must so manage that itcomes out of the fray to all appearances stronger than it came out ofthe fray preceding.  Each majority must be larger than the last, andso the lists are padded, and the repeaters imported, and thelodging-houses colonized, and the organization, like the frog in LaFontaine\\'s fable, though with less reason, swells and swells againstthe hour when it shall finally burst.  The saloons were crowded; itwas freely predicted that, the season being prosperous, votes wouldgo at no lower than two dollars, and, in some quarters and someinstances, as high as five dollars apiece.There were some points, however, to which the tide of prosperity hadnot risen, and one of these was the high tenement of Katie Flanagan.The Irish girl returned there every night a little more discouragedthan when she had left its precarious shelter in the morning, asdoubtful as ever of Hermann\\'s ability to support a wife, but moredoubtful than ever of her own ability to help, should they marry, inthe support of the home.  At the shop, the work and the hours weighedmore and more heavily upon her; they dragged at the heels of her mindwhen she endeavored to evade the insulting compliments of the callowyouths and gray men that strolled by her counter, and they wereimpedimenta that made it daily more difficult to escape withoutoffense the oily approaches of the dignified Mr. Porter.\"Sometimes,\" she said one evening, as she and Carrie sat over theirmeager supper, \"I begin wonderin\\' again whether it\\'s worth whilerunnin\\' away.\"The striking shirtwaist-maker, who had spent a long day onpicket-duty before a Waverley Place factory, looked up with roundeyes calmly serious.\"That is what I am wondering all the time,\" she replied.Katie made an impatient movement of her hand.\"Och, now,\" she generously protested, \"it\\'s all right for me togrowl, because I\\'ve got a job.  I don\\'t count, an\\' it\\'s just mehabit.  But you mustn\\'t do it, me dear.\"\"I am not complaining; I am just honestly wondering, that\\'s all.\"\"But if the worst came, you could go back to work, you know.\"Carrie\\'s face was all surprise.\"And turn traitor to my friends striking in my own and all the otherfactories?\" she asked.  \"Oh, no; you would be the last to do ityourself, Katie.  I would rather go on the street.\"\"You don\\'t mean that, darlin\\'.\"\"I do mean it.  If I went on the street, I would hurt myself, but ifI did the other thing I would hurt all the other girls in the union.\"She spoke quietly, but with infinite conviction, and Katie knew theforces that had brought about this state of mind.  The widespreadstrike, though it still continued, was a failure.  Public sentimenthad never been aroused; the employers had succeeded in securingnon-union labor, whose wages they were, even now, securely reducing,and whose privileges--granted to entice them to work--they werecurbing; their political powers earned them the armed assistance ofthe law; and the strikers\\' ranks, though but little thinned bydesertion, were steadily decreased by poverty, by the necessity ofthe girls to find other sorts of work, by illness, and, now that thecold autumn had set in, by death.  Carrie was underfed, scantilyclothed, penniless, and Katie, remembering these things, foundherself without reply.Had she needed further example of the pressure of conditions upon herkind, she could have found it in an incident in the shop on the dayfollowing.  A bull-necked young man, with ruddy cheeks and acertainty of manner that spoke as loudly in his eyes and hisscarf-pin as in his voice, sauntered up to the silk-stocking counter,where she happened then to be stationed, and began turning over thewares displayed.\"Have you been waited on?\" inquired Katie.\"No,\" said the young man, looking at her steadily; \"but I\\'d like youto wait on me.  Are you busy?\"Katie said nothing, but stood there.  The young man said nothing.Katie began to finger the boxes before her, but she felt that theyoung man was looking only at her.\"What quality would you like me to show you?\" she asked.\"Well,\" parried the customer, \"what quality do you like?\"She shot one glance at him: he was still looking at her.\"We have only the best at this counter,\" she answered, with a slightflush.  \"You\\'ll be findin\\' the cheaper the sixth aisle to your right.\"But the young man only laughed with unconcern, and continued to keephis gaze on her lowered Irish blue eyes.\"I can afford the best of everything,\" he said.There was a pause.  Katie raised her eyes and met his own withoutflinching.  He smiled, but he was quite too satisfied with his owncharms to notice that the salesgirl was not smiling.\"What time do you quit work?\" he inquired.\"I never quit.\"She said this as if she were closing a door, but the young manproceeded imperturbably to rattle at the knob.\"I thought,\" he said, \"that you might like to eat a little dinnerover at the \\'York\\' with me this evening.\"\"Thanks,\" the girl answered, \"but I do all me eatin\\' with mehusband.--Will you, please, be tellin\\' me what sort of stockin\\'s youwant?\"The young man grinned.  He seemed to enjoy what he took to be herplayful repartee.\"Look here,\" he replied, \"my wife is away back home, and I\\'m allalone over at that hotel.\"He was leaning airily toward her, both hands on the counter.  Katie,standing opposite, leaned toward him.  She answered his smile, but hecould not see that her smile was not of his own sort.\"Do you want to buy anything?\" she demanded.\"Yes,\" said the customer, meeting her gaze again.  \"Will you sell?\"It was no unusual incident, no more unusual than the coming incidentof Mirka\\'s attack upon Hermann, but the girl had reached the end ofher endurance, and what followed across that counter was not unlikewhat was to occur across Ludwig Schleger\\'s bar.  Katie opened herfirm, pink palm and smacked the young bargain-seeker smartly acrossthe mouth.There was no immediate consequence.  The aisle was too crowded toallow any but the nearest employees to witness the blow, and thecrowd was too intent upon its own thousand errands to heed whathappened before its eyes.  One or two salesgirls stood still at theirwork, petrified by alarm.  One or two customers hesitated andchuckled.  And then, as the young man with a face of crimsonshouldered his way into a hurried oblivion from which he neverreappeared, the rush of business sent the clerks whirling about theirown tasks and sent the crowd hurrying about its own purposes.But Katie knew that more would follow, and that what would followwould be an interview with Mr. Porter.  The shop\\'s system ofsurveillance missed nothing, and within a half-hour the girl wasstanding in the dark office where she had first been hired.In his likeness to a Sunday-school superintendent Mr. Porter wasshocked and grieved to hear that any young lady in the Lennox storewould strike a purchaser.  In his likeness to a surgeon he promptlydeclared that there ought to be no issue short of expulsion.  And inhis own hidden character--deep in his own abominable character--hewas wondering whether he could not turn this incident to theadvantage that he had so long sought.\"The viper was insultin\\' me,\" said Katie.\"Are you quite sure of that, Miss Flanagan?\"\"Sure I\\'m sure.  Do you have to wait for a snake to bite you beforeyou know what he\\'s up to?\"\"You could have called the floor-walker.\"\"And been fined for me pains, Mr. Porter.\"Mr. Porter tapped his desk and kept his eyes on his fingers.\"I find,\" he said slowly, \"that most men do not make approacheswithout some encouragement, in either word or manner, on the part ofthe girl.  I also find that such occurrences as this are very rare inthe experience of most of the girls in our employ.\"He stopped, but Katie stood silent by the arm of the desk, her lipscompressed, a frown between her arched black brows.  He sent acrooked glance up at her, and then resumed:\"I scarcely ever have a case of this sort to deal with.  I wonderwhy, if such things are done by customers, the other girls do notreport them.\"He stopped again, and this time Katie answered:\"I suppose they boss their own lives in their own way, Mr. Porter.\"A faint spark of color shone in Mr. Porter\\'s white cheek.\"I suppose they do,\" he answered, gently pulling at hisside-whiskers, and peeping at his victim over the caressing hand.\"In fact, between you and me, Miss Flanagan, I am told that some ofthem do that so well that they are practically independent of theirwages in this store.\"Again Katie failed to respond.\"Do you understand me, Miss Flanagan?\"Katie thought of her desperate days before she had found her presentemployment.  She thought of Hermann and what seemed to be the solechance of rising to a salary where marriage could be a practicalpossibility.  She thought of Carrie\\'s plight and of Carrie\\'sdependence upon her.\"I do that, Mr. Porter,\" she answered.He looked up squarely then, and she even managed to torture her faceinto an expression of roguery.\"Ah,\" said Mr. Porter, smiling a paternal smile.  He reached out andpatted her hand, and, though her soul revolted, she managed to keepher hand passive.  \"Now, my dear young lady, you are at last comingto your senses.  You mustn\\'t take life so seriously.\"\"I\\'ll try not to, Mr. Porter.\"\"That\\'s right; that\\'s right.  I ought to discharge you, I know.  Itmay be difficult not to discharge you.  But I will do this much: Iwill suspend judgment for a few days.\"He looked at her fixedly.  Her cold lips formed another phrase ofthanks.\"And in the meantime,\" he continued, \"you let me know of some eveningwhen you can come out to a quiet corner where we can have suppertogether, and where we won\\'t be wasting the firm\\'s time.  Then we\\'lltalk this whole thing over, and I\\'ll see what I can do.\"The eyes of neither wavered.\"Thank you, Mr. Porter,\" said Katie again.With that she left him, but she went away with the knowledge that hergame of hide-and-seek was almost ended.  Just when it would end wasbeyond all guessing, but that it would end soon and that it would endin her defiance of her superiors and her prompt expulsion seemedaltogether certain.  She reflected that the small delay which she hadgained would profit but lightly those in whose interests she hadattempted to truckle and palliate, and, when, that night, she toldher experience to Carrie, her words fell upon ears that read intothem a portentous meaning.The homely, brown-haired Lithuanian, whose cheeks were less round nowthan they had been, and whose hair that needed no covering in thesummer, was still uncovered, went to her weary picket-duty inWaverley Place the next morning--the morning, as it happened, thatpreceded Hermann\\'s little brush with Mirka--with a slow step and aheavy heart.  She knew the futility of the work she was performing;she saw it even in the relaxed vigilance of the policemen on thecorners and in the mocking grins of the girls and toughs at thegloomy factory-door.  All day as, sometimes companioned and sometimesalone, she plodded her eventless round, the irony of the task bitinto her soul.  Something she must do, and soon.  Already she wasdeep in Katie\\'s debt, and Katie was near dismissal.The early autumn twilight dropped among the grimy buildings.  Theevening tide of Broadway rose and roared into Waverley Place.  A coldwind lashed the dust into little whirlpools, wound the girl\\'s cheaplawn skirt tightly about her aching knees, and ate through that thinmaterial to the tingling skin.  There was no one with her now, andshe felt more than ever alone.From the shadow of a doorway a man crossed the street and approachedher.He was a man of uncertain age, of almost any age below the earlythirties.  As he bowed to her, the girl saw that his hair was darkand curly; that the back of his hand, which was not the hand of aworker, was covered with a black down, and that through the paleolive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks there shone the blue-blackbanners of a wiry beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thickuntil they smiled, above white teeth, in greeting, and his grayglance had the character of an appraisement of whatever it lookedupon.  Carrie noticed, protruding from his breast-coatpocket, apurple bordered handkerchief.\"Hello,\" he said.She looked at him gravely.  She had never seen him before, but withhis kind she had lately grown enough familiar.  Wherever there arewomen on strike, men of his sort gather, as the vultures gather aboutdying animals in a jungle.  Yet Carrie said nothing.  She was, as shehad expressed it to Katie, still wondering.\"I\\'ve been _vatch_in\\' you,\" said the man.  \"I\\'ve been vatchin\\' youall _tay_.\"\"Have you?\"  Carrie was totally incurious.\"Yes, I\\'d think you\\'d be pretty tired of sooch _fool_ishness.\"\"I am tired.\"\"You can\\'t vin.  If you go back it will be _choost_ the samehell-mill it vas be_fore_.\"\"I suppose it would.\"\"Vell then\"--his hands spread themselves in protest--\"vhy don\\'t you_qvit_?  A pretty, strong girl like you could make _loads_ of moneyfer herself.\"Carrie was leaning against the factory wall.  She did not move.\"How?\" she asked.\"Vell, you hafn\\'t got no _od_der trade, eh?\"\"No.\"\"Und you vouldn\\'t vant to be a _ser_vant?\"\"Why not?\"\"Because that\\'s vorse nor a _shirt_vaist-factory.\"\"Then I wouldn\\'t want to be a servant.\"Again the man extended his hands.\"Vell?\" he said.\"But I knew one girl that went into a house,\" affirmed Carrie, \"and Iwouldn\\'t do that for a fortune.\"Her practical manner might have disconcerted most men, but this man\\'sbusiness had accustomed him to all forms of rejoinder.  Heimmediately began an endeavor to persuade her by economic arguments.But Carrie interrupted him.\"No,\" she said, \"if I do it, it will be only because I have to, andthen I\\'ll not do it that way.  Thank you, just the same.  Here comesmy relief: I don\\'t have to wait till the girls come out to-day.Good-by.\"He essayed to protest, but she walked quietly by him, made her briefreport to the oncoming women, and started on her journey homeward.The man, whose trade imposed patience, said no more.  He did notagain approach her, and, though she knew that he was following her,through the growing crowd that rolled eastward, to mark herhiding-place, she did not attempt to elude him.  She was very tired.This was the evening that preceded the early morning call of Angelthe Italian and Mirka the Austrian to Ludwig Schleger\\'s saloon, andit was about eight hours later that Hermann, having seen hisassailants leave, turned his back to the bar-room door and, alone inthe place, set about washing the discarded glasses.  Except that hewas sleepy, he was in his usual spirits and he was whistling \"DieWacht Am Rhein.\"  He was whistling so loudly that he did not hear thedoor reopen.There was a flash as of a thousand blinding lights, a roar as if atrain had fallen from the elevated road overhead, and Hermann, in thesmoke-filled saloon, himself fell crashing behind the bar, and laythere, huddled and still.Mirka quietly reclosed the door and darted around the corner.XXIITHE SERPENTS\\' DENPoverty, which produces the slave, breeds, just as surely, theslaver.  Take where you will the trail of the trafficker in women,this rule is proven.  It is proven in puritan Boston and protectedNew Orleans, in Chicago and Washington, in Philadelphia and SanFrancisco, and on the heroic scale it is nowhere more plainly proventhan in the heroic city of New York.On Manhattan Island is, indeed, the Mother-Church, howeverunconsciously organized, of the black faith, and though, ofnecessity, there spontaneously arise elsewhere congregations thatreach back to her, here is founded and established the Congregationof the Propaganda that reaches out to them.  Its missionaries--itswomen, men, and methods--have stretched to Nome and the Canal Zone;they are preaching their own brand of dogma against the nativeversions of Buenos Ayres and Sydney, of Shanghai and Cape Town; andwithin its home city the hierarchy is entrenched by financialstrength, political power, and legal negligence.  As an industry, ithas its wholesalers and retailers; or, as a church, its bishops sitin their national house of peers, while its younger orders, itsproselyting priests and evangelizing deacons, perform their especialtasks, the young appealing to the young, the poor preying uponpoverty.The entrance to these lower orders lies, as in most orders and mostbusinesses, through a period of probation: the lad of sixteen playsthe rôle of watchdog and spy for his superiors, for which he earns anoccasional fifty-cent piece, or a casual kettle of beer, vastlyincreasing his income if he now and then diverts, as he generallydoes, his energies to the occupation of amateur theft.  From thisstage he is admitted, by his own efforts, to the possession of onegirl, whom he bullies into working for him along the streets.  He mayoccasionally deign to appear as a waiter in a café, and offer hiswoman to its drunken habitués; but most frequently he scorns allmenial labor, for which, in fact, conditions have utterly unfittedhim.  Sometimes he increases his slave-holdings to a trio of women,and even farms out his victims to friends in his own or otherneighborhoods or towns: more often he delivers his human wares to theproprietors of houses intended for their reception, being paid in alump sum, or on a royalty basis; but in either case his ambition is,naturally, to rise to the position of the large property-holder orthe political receiver of tribute.  If he is an Italian, commonconsent limits his operations to the southern end of the Bowery; ifhe is a Jew, his field lies about the Houston and Essex Streetsdistricts; whatever his European parentage, he seeks hisfellow-countrywomen, and if he is American born he has the freedom ofBroadway.His means are multitude.  Wherever there is squalor seeking ease, heis there.  Wherever there is distress crying for succor, discontentcomplaining for relief, weariness sighing for rest, there is thismissionary, this \"cadet,\" offering the quack salvation of histemporal church.  He knows and takes subtle advantage of the Jewishsisters sent to work for the education of Jewish brothers; the Irish,the Germans, the Russians, and the Syrians ground in one or anothereconomic mill; the restless neurotic native-daughters untrained forwork and spoiled for play.  He is at the door of the factory when itreleases its white-faced women for a breath of night air; he is atthe cheap lunch-room where the stenographers bolt unwholesome noondayfood handed about by underpaid waitresses; he lurks around the cornerfor the servant and the shop-clerk.  He remembers that these aregirls too tired to do household work in their evenings, too untaughtto find continued solace in books; that they must go out, that theymust move about; and so he passes his own nights at the restaurantsand theaters, the moving-picture shows, the dancing academies, thedance-halls.  He may go into those stifling rooms where immigrants,long before they learn to make a half-complete sentence of what theycall the American language, learn what they are told are Americandances: the whirling \"spiel\" with blowing skirts, the \"half-timewaltz\" with jerking hips.  He may frequent the more sophisticatedforms of these places, may even be seen in the more expensive cafés,or may journey into the provinces.  But he scents poverty from afar.Where training is as yet too strong or distress too weak to makeserve the offer of partnership, the promise of marriage usuallysuffices.  The thing is done, and once done, blows and starvationperpetuate it with the ignorant, and threats of exposure and publicshame rivet the shackles on the more knowing.  The former suffer fortheir darkness; the latter are held the faster in proportion to theirprevious respectability.One has said that this church is established; in every city itmaintains its incestuous marriage to the state.  It controls realvotes by the thousands and provides false ones by the tens ofthousands.  It is a church that may be considered to exercise the oldecclesiastical right of trying its own offenders in its own courts.When the magistrates have not begun as slavers, when they own nopoor, but highly rented, houses, leased for prostitution, when theydo not even accept tithes from the traffic, it is still largely thetraffic that elects and can defeat them.  What the Black Church owesto the political powers for their protection, the political powersowe to the church for its ballots.It was this condition that made possible the impunity of such a deedas the Austrian Mirka had done upon Hermann Hoffmann, the bar-keeper;that made certain the assailant\\'s escape, and that made of the entirematter merely a question as to which of several handy means should beemployed to free the slaver in the eyes of the law.  About thosemeans there had, however, been some debate, and so it befell that,early on the Sunday evening following the shooting, Rafael Angelellisat in a recognized New York meeting-place of the church\\'sproselyting order, engaged in pleasant converse with Wesley Dyker,candidate for a magistracy.  This place was the back-room of asaloon.  It was filled with cigarette-smoking young missionaries, whotalked shop, and quoted prices, and discussed the prospects of a goodseason in precisely the businesslike way that men in alivestock-dealers\\' club talk shop, and quote prices, and discuss theprospects of a good season.  Dyker had not at all wanted to comethere, but O\\'Malley had ordered, and so, making peace with thetolerant Angelelli, he had been forced to obey.  A special counselfor the sheriff of New York had once been a member of the legal corpsof the missionaries and so had two State Senators: O\\'Malley,remembering Dyker\\'s previous career, could see no reason for presentpride.The room was clouded with smoke.  Waiters hurried about serving beerfrom brass platters and swabbing the small tables with damp rags.There was a buzz of conversation broken by that peculiar form oflaughter which responds only to obscenities, and now and then, out ofthe general clamor, there arose oaths almost technical, descriptionsof women that sounded like auctioneers\\' announcements in ahorse-market, and fragments of stories in which the teller bragged ofa sharp deal he had effected in capturing a slave or in bargainingwith a proprietress.\"I understand,\" said Dyker, with his eyelids characteristicallylowered, \"that you want to see me in regard to something about thisshooting-affair of your friend Mirka.\"Angel\\'s oily head bobbed a ready assent.\"Where\\'s the fellow that was hurt?\"\"In Bellevue.\"\"Is he going to die?\"\"Naw; eet was only a leetle one in hees shoulder.\"\"Anybody else in the bar when it happened?\"\"Naw.\"That was better.  Wesley took a sip of beer.\"Mirka was alone, too?\"\"Yas.\"\"Did the bar-keeper see him?\"\"Naw; hees back was rounda to da door.\"\"There\\'d been a quarrel beforehand, though?\"\"Ah, some small word only.\"\"And nobody saw Mirka come back or leave the place the second time?\"Nobody had seen him.Then how was it that the injured man, in the hospital, had said thatMirka had done the shooting?Angel explained that Hermann based his accusation partly on anuncertain and partial glimpse of Mirka caught in the bar-mirror atthe instant that the shot was fired, but largely on the precedingquarrel.\"This Hoffmann couldn\\'t swear to Mirka\\'s identity from that mereglimpse?\"The Italian thought not.\"Well, then,\" said Wesley, \"it all ought to be easy enough.  Everybar-keeper knows a lot of drunks that might want to hurt him.\"Rafael shrugged.\"You can feex eet,\" he said.  \"Meest\\' O\\'Malley say you feex eet easy.\"\"But,\" replied Dyker, \"I don\\'t see how I can act as Mirka\\'s lawyer,unless it is all done quickly.  You know, I\\'m about to be electedmagistrate.\"\"Poof!\" said Angel, blowing a thin spiral of blue cigarette-smoke.\"We gotta da lawyer.\"\"Oh!\"  Dyker looked up quickly, and quickly down again.  \"Then youwant me--I see.\"\"Good.\"The prospective magistrate began making rings on the table with hiswet glass.\"But I should think there were other ways.  The man hasn\\'t beenarrested yet?\"\"Naw.\"\"Then why need the police find him?\"\"Thees O\\'Malley say eet looka better.\"\"He might jump his bail.\"\"Naw.\"\"It\\'s often done that way.\"\"O\\'Malley say \\'naw\\'.\"\"Or he might go up for trial.  There\\'s no real evidence against him:nobody saw the shot fired.  And besides, even if we couldn\\'t fixthings in court, which is always easy enough, we could get him apardon as we did for Pud Morley or Frank Da Silva.\"But Angel would have none of these propositions.  Michael O\\'Malleywas, it seemed, inexorable.  There had been enough bail-jumping,queer verdicts, and pardons for a few months.  The case must comebefore the new magistrate, and the new magistrate must declare thatthe testimony was not sufficient to warrant holding the prisoner forcourt.\"Where is Mirka now?\" asked Dyker.\"Een Philadelph\\',\" said Angel.\"Loafing?\"\"Naw.  He tooka one of heesa girls along.  I am takin\\' care of deesother one.\"\"Can\\'t we get hold of the Dutchman and make him see who\\'s back of allthis?\"\"Naw; dees Dutch\\' ees a fool.\"\"Won\\'t even be bought?\"\"Naw.\"\"And can\\'t be scared?\"\"Naw; I tell you dees Dutch\\' ees a damn fool.\"Wesley did not like the plan; he did not like it at all; but he wasalready harnessed fast, and he had learned that it was best to followwithout protest the directing rein.  He achieved a smile.\"All right,\" he agreed.The Italian\\'s face lighted with gratification.\"You do eet?\" he asked.\"I\\'ll arrange it; don\\'t worry.\"\"Good!  Good!  That\\'s good!\"Angel\\'s pleasure was so pronounced that Dyker for a momentfeared--though it would have made small difference--lest the cadetmake to the entire company a public announcement of his promise.  Heneed not, however, have worried.  Rafael was wholly used to theselegal fictions and to the etiquette that imposed their formalobservance; his delight took the shape of an order for another pairof drinks, and, those dispatched, he leisurely got upon his littlefeet.\"Now,\" said he, \"I go.  I hava da businesses.\"He smiled wisely at the concluding word.Wesley also rose.\"I\\'ll have to be getting along myself,\" he remarked.\"Ah, but you can stay eef you feel like,\" said Angel.  \"I maka youknow deesa mens.\"\"Thanks.  I do know most of them,\" replied Dyker, nodding to two orthree of the nearby cadets as he spoke.  \"But I have some business,too.  These are busy times with me.\"They both made their way to the saloon\\'s side door.\"Goin\\' so soon?\" chorused some of the habitués as Angel moved amongthem.He nodded, smiling cheerfully.\"Goin\\' to kop out a new skirt?\" inquired one.\"Yas,\" responded Rafael, now with a frank, satisfied chuckle.\"Then here\\'s luck!\" cried another.As the health was being drunk, Dyker passed through the door andturned, alone, into the cool night air of the street.Notwithstanding his natural bias, his severe schooling, and hishonestly cynical and cynically limited view of this portion of hislittle world, he was ashamed of what he had just seen and heard anddone, and he was disgusted.  He walked down the avenue in thedeepened shadows, for the first time in a long while more than halfinclined to ask himself whether what he was to get was worth theprice that he had already begun to pay for it; and for the firsttime, by way of answer, frankly facing the fact that the position ofa corrupt magistrate was not much worse than that of a corruptlawyer, and that neither position was much worse, and both certainlybetter paid, than the position in which his task had been to renderanonymous assistance to the no less dubious course of more esteemedcorporation attorneys.He was too occupied with these reflections, disquieting andconsolatory, to observe well the persons that passed him.  Hecontinued his way along the curb rather because he had started uponit than because he at all cared about whither it led him, much as hewas continuing his progress in the political maze in which his lotwas cast.  He kept his head bent, and so he did not see a pale-faced,large-eyed woman that, turning a hasty corner, almost collided withhim and then suddenly drew back and crossed the street.There were changes in the woman\\'s face, which might have precludedrecognition.  He had last seen her on the eve of a surgical operationand she had looked ill, but now, the cumulative effect of that andmany other crises sat upon her, and it was only in her habitual gait,the swaying languid pace of an unstudied young animal, that he mighthave found enough to recall her to his memory.  But Dyker\\'s eyes weredirected inward and so, when she turned aside to avoid the man thatshe fancied she had wronged, he did not realize that he had almosttouched elbows with the woman he had once rescued, fresh from herdismissal from the sacred precincts of Mrs. Ferdinand Chamberlin\\'shome.She had started away from Washington Square in the same dull pain inwhich she had previously left the Ninth Street boarding-housepresided over by the stony-breasted Mrs. Alberta Turner; she had beenonly a wounded dog, whose sole desire was to find a dark corner inwhich she could suffer unobserved; but slowly there reasserted itselfin her torpid brain that new impulse toward a questioning of lifewhich had so appalled Philip Beekman.  The whole she could not see;her own case bulked so far in the foreground that little else of thepicture was visible to her.  But she knew that an ill-constructedworld was against her; she concluded that all legitimate doors wereclosed upon her, and she felt gradually kindling a wrath that wouldend in general reprisal.How she chanced into Rivington Street she did not know.  She had noclear idea as to where she was to go, except that she must not returnto burden Katie Flanagan.  Yet, almost before she was clearlyconscious of her whereabouts, she found herself accosted by a voicethat proved to come from the lips of Marian Lennox.\"Mary Morton!  How do you do?  Where are you going?  Where on earthhave you been?  Come in here; I\\'m just getting back from a walk.  Iam so anxious to hear how you are getting on, and I have been sodisappointed because you never let me hear from you.\"The rivulet of cheerful words poured from the calm-faced woman withunheeding force.  Each one of them fell upon her auditor with anunintended shock.  Mary, who had almost forgotten the pseudonym underwhich she had been presented at the Settlement, could say nothing.She was carried up the steps and into the house, up the stairs andinto the deserted sitting-room on the second floor; and there shesank limply into a wicker chair beside a magazine-littered table,tête-à-tête with her former benefactress.Marian, all good intentions, rested her delicate chin upon her whitehands.\"Now,\" she said, \"I am anxious to hear all about you.\"Mary, with a perplexed frown, looked hard at the floor.\"Why, there isn\\'t much to tell, Miss Lennox,\" she replied.\"Nonsense.  Of course there is, my dear.  You must understand that Iam interested in everything about you--in everything.\"Mary\\'s eyes sought, for a moment, the pure, cameo-like face.  Theycould see no evil there, and they could see much kindliness.\"Well, then,\" she hesitated, \"I don\\'t know exactly where to begin.\"\"At the beginning, of course.  How do you like your place?\"\"Which place, Miss Lennox?\"\"The place we sent you to.\"\"I\\'m not there no more.\"\"Not there?\"  Marian raised her perfectly arched brows.  \"But, mydear Mary, why not?  Didn\\'t you like it?\"\"I didn\\'t mind.\"\"Then you have found a better place?\"Again Mary studied her questioner.\"Miss Lennox,\" she said, \"I guess you people here have all sorts ofgirls comin\\' around, don\\'t you?\"There was a surprise in this departure, and Marian\\'s deep eyesmirrored it.  The questioner had become the questioned.\"A great many kinds,\" she replied.  \"Why do you ask?\"\"Girls that work at all sorts of things?\"\"To be sure.\"\"And you want to help \\'em?\"\"We try to help them all.\"\"Yes; I thought so.  Can you help \\'em all, Miss Lennox?\"\"When they let us, I think we can.\"\"Then what do you do about them that hasn\\'t been straight?\"Marian softly caught her breath.\"Oh,\" she said; \"I----\"  She had learned, since their last meeting, alittle about the girls concerning whom Mary was inquiring, and shehad learned much regarding the Settlement\\'s attitude toward them; butshe had learned, also, that the work of the place most lay with theflowers that bloomed among the weeds, and so, \"Well, you see,\" shelamely continued, \"Well, we do the best we can.\"\"What\\'s that, please, Miss Lennox?  I\\'ve got a particular reason forwanting to know.\"Marian understood.  She spoke softly, and softly laced and interlacedher long white fingers, resting in her lap.\"We do the best we can, Mary,\" she repeated, more confidently.  \"Whenwe have investigated the case and are sure such a girl is sorry, orwasn\\'t entirely to blame, and that she means to do what is right inthe future, we make her our personal friend.  We encourage her tocome here and talk to us and get all the help possible.  We have heraround to all the entertainments----\"\"Can she learn?\" asked Mary.\"Learn?\"  Marian\\'s voice was puzzled.\"Can she go to the clubs and the classes they talked about when I washere first?\" explained Mary.Marian shook a doubtful head.\"You see that wouldn\\'t do, right away, Mary,\" she said.  \"We have tothink of the other girls, and we have to protect the girls that _are_straight as well as help those that haven\\'t been.  These are theirclubs, after all, and they wouldn\\'t like it, if they knew.  Itwouldn\\'t be just for us to deceive them, and they have the firstclaim on our protection.\"\"Why?\"It was the hardest question that Marian Lennox had ever had put toher.  She tried to form an answer, but though she could think of manythat seemed to her logical, she could think of none that seemed kind.Sympathy sprang to her eyes.  She put out her hands.\"Mary!\" she said.But Mary had received her reply.\"It don\\'t matter, Miss Lennox,\" she said, and she said it so calmlyand so coldly that Marian involuntarily drew back in her chair.  \"Ijust wondered, that was all.\"She stopped an instant.  Her hostess tried to speak and could not,but presently the girl pursued:\"I wasn\\'t square with you, that night you gave me the recommedationto Mrs. Turner, Miss Lennox.  I suppose I ought to\\'ve told you allabout myself, but I had to get work, an\\' I knew if I told you Iwouldn\\'t get no job.  I\\'d been--I\\'d been in a house.  I wanted to getaway, an\\' a man had just got me out a little more\\'n a month or sobefore.\"\"It was not exactly honest of you,\" said Marian.She was sorry as soon as she had spoken, but Mary, showing no sign ofhurt or resentment, was continuing before reparation or explanationcould be made.Very simply she told the hard outward facts of her story.  She didnot give the history of her capture, because her experience with Mrs.Turner, with the homely little woman that had called at theemployment-agency, and with Philip Beekman had shown her that thiscould not lessen the extent of her contamination.  Honestly rejectingher deception of Marian, goaded by that glimpse of Wesley Dyker intoan impulse to make, at any cost to herself, the amend of truth forwhat fault she had committed, she was still more powerfully moved bya determination to accept without reservation the part that the worldhad now assigned her, and to fight under no colors save her own.Marian, her fine face drawn with pain, heard the narrative in asilence broken only when Mary had concluded with her departure fromthe hospital.  The girl had mentioned no names.\"And even this one man,\" murmured Marian at last, \"even this man whohad the courage to rescue you--even he was a visitor at such a place?\"\"Why, of course,\" said Mary, as yet unused to the idea of any blameattaching to the mere male patronage of slavery.  \"How else could Ihave got him for help?\"\"But you said he was in love with that woman who conductedthe--house.\"\"With Miss Rose?\"\"What did you call her?\"\"Mrs. Rose Légère she called herself, but I guess that wasn\\'t hername.  Yes, he was kind of in love with her.  He was one of herfavorites anyhow, but that was just because he had a pull with thepoliticians, you see.  She let him love her so\\'s she could work him,an\\' when I put him wise to that, he was glad to help me.\"Marian clinched her fist.\"The abominable cur!\" she said.\"Oh, no!  Not that,\" protested Mary.  She had failed this man byretracting her affidavit, but she meant to be loyal to himwheresoever she could.  His name slipped from her with no thought ofconsequences.  \"It took a lot of nerve an\\' goodness to do for me whatMr. Dyker done.\"Marian\\'s gaze became fixed.  She was a woman whose whole training hadshaped her against sudden betrayal of emotion, but she needed everyprecept of that training now.  She did not start, she did not flush,but her hands moved to the arms of her chair and gripped them hard.\"Did you say Mr. Wesley Dyker?\" she asked.Her voice did not betray her to the woman opposite, but Mary fearedlest her own desire to defend her deliverer had betrayed him.\"That\\'s who it was, Miss Lennox,\" she admitted, adding anxiously:\"But I didn\\'t go to mention it.\"You won\\'t tell it to no one that could use it against him, will you?\"\"Oh, no!\"  Marian laughed a short, hard laugh and rose to hidewhatever might be seen of her confusion.  \"Oh, no,\" she said; \"Ishan\\'t speak of this to any enemy.\"Her movement had seemed to Mary as a sign that the interview wasending, but the laughter chilled her.  She also rose, and stoodbefore her hostess.\"You don\\'t know him?\" she tremulously inquired.\"I think,\" said Marian, \"that I used to know somebody by some suchname, but I do not know him now.  He need not disturb himself, andwhen you see him you need not disturb him by saying that you spoke ofthis to me.\"\"Oh, I won\\'t see him,\" Mary assured her.  \"It ain\\'t likely I\\'ll eversee see him again.\"Marian\\'s eyes searched her, but they detected nothing disingenuous.\"You have quarreled?\" she demanded.\"No, only he wanted me to testify against Miss Rose, an\\' I was tooscared.  I just hid myself.\"There was a simple appeal in the bare words that brought their hearerto her better self.  Within her there burned a new and mounting fire,but her face was cool and her actions were reasoned.\"Mary,\" she said, determined to sink herself and to be true to hercode, \"I am very sorry to have heard all this.  I am sorry that Iseemed harsh when I said you had not been quite honest with us.\"\"But I hadn\\'t been, Miss Lennox.\"\"It was not altogether your fault if you weren\\'t, Mary.  I begin tosee that it must be rather hard, sometimes, to be quite honest.\"\"It is, sometimes.\"\"But you have been honest now with me, and I want to help you.  Iwant you to come around here in the way I described.  I want you tocome often.\"She paused, and then, as Mary did not respond, she added:\"Will you?\"Mary\\'s eyes were on the floor.\"Do you think you can get me a job?\" she asked.  \"Do you think anyonecan?\"Marian had thought nothing about it.\"Why, really, I don\\'t know, Mary.  But I suppose so.  Anyhow, I\\'llsee what I can do--though of course I shouldn\\'t feel justified inprocuring you a position under false pretenses.  You understand that?\"\"Yes,\" said Mary, \"I understand.\"\"And, at any rate, you will come around to-morrow?\"Still Mary did not look up.\"You will come?\" repeated Marian.\"Yes, Miss Lennox,\" said Mary.\"Very well, then: to-morrow afternoon.\"Something in the girl\\'s attitude made Marian uneasy.  She insisted onher point, but again Mary was slow to answer, and again Marian asked:\"Will you?\"\"Yes, Miss Lennox.\"\"At five o\\'clock, Mary.\"\"I\\'ll try, Miss Lennox.\"\"Promise.\"Mary stepped to the door.  She looked up and put out her hand, but,although Marian saw this, and started to respond, thesettlement-worker\\'s hand fell back to her side.  Mary seemed first toobserve and then not at all to have observed it.\"I promise,\" she said quietly, and left the room and the house.Inside, Marian was looking at her hand as if, because it had refusedto seek that of the woman who, she concluded, had shared RoseLégère\\'s intimacy with Dyker, it had been scorched by the new passionaflame in her own heart.  Outside, Mary, tramping the evening street,saw, in her memory of that hand withheld, a hand pointing herdefinitely away from the keeping of her promise, pointing her onwarddown the street as the place where, for the future, she must live andwork.XXIIIKATIE\\'S DAYThe election came, and went in just the way that everybody expectedit to go.  Wesley Dyker\\'s political craft, along with many others,was carried on the inrushing waves of his party\\'s success to thehaven where he had desired it to rest, and the prosperity that hadraised the price of votes to five dollars apiece immediately resumedits unostentatious levy upon the voters against the next election.The defeated candidates forgot their so recent denunciations andcongratulated their victorious opponents; the victorious opponentsforgot their tinsel pledges and resumed the safe and sure business ofgovernment for revenue only, and the population of New York, like thepopulation of most cities, forgot all the good things that had beenpledged it, and turned its energies to the everyday task of takingwhat it could get.Meanwhile Carrie Berkowicz, homely and hopeless, pursued, with adogged earnestness, the path that conditions had hewn for her, andalways she pursued it not alone.  As the waiting beast prowls behindthe slowly weakening traveler lost in a jungle, as the bird of preycircles calmly above the wounded man in the forest, as both beast andbird stand by until there comes the moment when strength can nolonger oppose them, so, day after day, rarely speaking, but alwayswatching, there followed in this girl\\'s footsteps the dark young manwith curling hair and shining teeth, who had accosted her on WaverleyPlace.  He seemed to watch for her morning entrance upon the street,and to be the last to see her when she dragged her wasting body intothe tenement at night.  Much of the time he dogged her like a foulshadow.  She would pass him in a doorway, she would see him loungingat a corner, she would catch glimpses of him across a crowded street.There were times when she feared to look up lest she should have toanswer that prosperous leer and ornate bow; there were others, atlast, when, as his well-fed body brushed by her, she almost pluckedat his sleeve with her hungry hands.  He never stopped, but sometime,she knew, he would stop; he never said more than \"Good-morning\" or\"Good-evening,\", but sometime, sometime soon, he would, she knew, saymore.And meanwhile, too, the politically unaffected routine of the Lennoxdepartment-store began gradually to provide for one of its victims atleast the sense of approaching variety: Katie Flanagan realized thatthe end of her usefulness--as that phrase is termed by employers,boarding-school principals, and others in authority--was rapidlynearing.  She managed to avoid the immaculate Mr. Porter for oneweek, and, but for her worry over the condition of the woundedHermann, would have had moments when the sport was amusing.  As thetaskmaster paused at her counter one time during the second week, sheachieved a sick aunt, who sufficed to account for her occupiedevenings.  But when the days and the nights dragged by with no changefor either the better or the worse in the condition of thisbed-ridden relative, and when the girl\\'s invention began to flag, andher spirit to tire, Mr. Porter\\'s glance grew more and more searching,his manner less and less warm, and Katie knew that she must soonretreat or surrender.\"I have not seen much of you lately, Miss Flanagan,\" remarked Mr.Porter as, late one afternoon, he came mincing to the counter whereshe stood.\"I\\'ve been here pretty regular, Mr. Porter,\" answered Katie.Mr. Porter caressed a gray side-whisker.\"Um,\" said he.  \"I presume, then, that your grandmother is no worse.\"\"It\\'s me aunt, sir,\" rejoined Katie, with the mental addition: \"Youdidn\\'t catch me that time, you ould tom-cat.\"  And she added: \"Thegood woman\\'s some better, thanks.\"\"I see,\" said Mr. Porter, and, indeed, his cold gaze seemed to see agreat deal more than he was inclined to mention.  \"At this rate ofimprovement, I hope you will soon find time to consider the matter wediscussed that day in my office.\"\"I hope that, Mr. Porter,\" smiled Katie.\"Yes,\" concluded Mr. Porter, turning from her--he always turned awaywhen he was most significant.  \"I hope so, too, for I can\\'t well keepyour case under advisement much longer.\"Several of the salesgirls nearby laughed openly, and Katie, when hewas out of sight, looked at them with a grimace half sad, halfmocking.The next morning she was transferred to a bargain-counter for the day.What the outcome might have been there is no imagining.  What it wasdepended, at any rate in part, upon the fact that, on what proved tobe her last day at the shop, she had come to work with a tired bodyand an aching head.  She had sat up half the night in a long endeavorto persuade Carrie to leave the futile battle of the strikers andturn to other employment; and, when Carrie had rejected all proposalson the ground that, though the fight was lost, she knew no other sortof work, Katie had spent about all the remainder of the dark hours inan attempt to convince her roommate that the Irish girl\\'s wages wereenough to support both of them for some time to come.  The result, sofar as went her conduct at the store, was a temper ready to explodewith the first spark, and that spark came when, in midafternoon, anervous woman, who persisted in examining everything and buyingnothing, interpreted Katie\\'s lassitude as indifference and soreported it to the floor-walker.Katie was sent for to come to Mr. Porter\\'s office.Mr. Porter looked up from the light at his desk, and then down again.He stroked a whisker.\"Sit down, Miss Flanagan,\" he said.\"Thanks,\" replied Katie, \"I can take it just as well standin\\'.\"\"Take what?\" asked Mr. Porter.\"Anythin\\' at all you have to say,\" said Katie.Mr. Porter continued to look at his desk and, by the name of \"MissFlanagan,\" addressed it severely.\"Miss Flanagan,\" he said, \"you have again been reported to me fordiscourtesy to a customer.  The other case had not yet been adjusted.It might have been adjusted had not your cousin----\"\"Me aunt,\" prompted Katie.\"Your aunt,\" frowned Mr. Porter to his desk, \"had not your aunt beenso disinclined to recover.\"\"She was gettin\\' absent treatment from a bad doctor.\"\"I know nothing of that----\"\"I think meself it was Malicious Animal Magnetism.\"\"Please do not interrupt,\" said Mr. Porter, shaking his whiskers atthe desk.  \"I say that the previous case was not adjusted, though itmight have been, if your mother had not remained so ill.\"\"Me aunt.\"\"Your aunt, if you prefer it.  Now comes this second case, andreally, I am curious to know whether you can suggest anything thatwill make me regard it with the smallest degree of lenience.\"He looked again at the desk, as if the desk were the case he hadreferred to, but neither the desk nor Katie answered.\"If you cannot,\" he at last concluded, \"I see no course but one forme to pursue.\"Katie folded her arms across her breast and tossed her black head.\"There\\'s only one thing I can think of,\" said she, and waited.Mr. Porter breathed hard.\"And what,\" he inquired, still without looking at her, \"is that?\"Katie took a soft step forward.  She rested her hands upon the arm ofhis desk and leaned her face toward him.\"Don\\'t you know?\" she asked in a low voice.Mr. Porter shot, from the corner of his eyes, one of his crookedglances at her.\"I am not quite sure,\" he said.\"Then,\" replied Katie, \"I\\'ll tell you.  The only one thing I canthink of that\\'d get you to let me off is the only one you can thinkof yourself--_an\\' that\\'s the one I won\\'t do!_\"Her voice, which had begun so softly, ended in a loud note.  Herhands, which had been open, clinched.  Her body, which had beenrelaxed, stiffened.Mr. Porter sprang back from her, looked at her with hot fright in hisusually cool eyes, and then shrank as far away as his desk-armchairwould permit.\"Miss Flanagan,\" he spluttered, \"not so loud, please!  You will alarmthe store.\"\"I wish I could alarm it!\" said Katie.\"But what--what--I don\\'t understand----\"\"Yes, you do understand, all right, all right, Mr. Porter.  I knowwhat you want; I\\'ve known it all along, an\\' if I hadn\\'t liked to makea fool of you, I\\'d have told you long since what I tell you now: _Youwon\\'t get it!_\"If it were possible for Mr. Porter to grow whiter than his habit, hegrew whiter then.\"I shall--I shall ring for assistance!\" he protested.\"No you won\\'t; you won\\'t dare; you\\'ll sit there, an\\' write me out arecommendation an\\' an order for me pay--if your hand ain\\'t shakin\\'too much, an\\' if it is, I\\'ll write it for you.\"And he did write it.  After one look at her, he wrote it without aword, and \"without,\" as Katie carefully stipulated, \"any dockin\\' forthe last offense,\" and as she left him she delivered one Parthianbolt.\"Remember me to the girl you start after in the mornin\\',\" she said;\"an\\' when you go home to-night, just give megrandmother-mother-aunt-cousin\\'s best regards to your grown-upgreat-grandchildren.\"The taste in which her revolution expressed itself may have been asdoubtful as the courage that inspired it was certain; but, had Mr.Porter been able to see into her mind as she hurried homeward, hewould have been gratified at what he found there.  The excitement hadgone, and with it the bravery.  She had preserved her individualideals, but she now realized at what a cost she had preserved them.Against masculine attack it was sometimes inspiriting to defendherself, but to the slow and continuous advance of penury she wellknew that, at last, she must succumb.She passed her ugly little parish-church, and, remembering that shehad missed her last confession, entered its forbidding doors.The swinging portal closed softly behind her.  It shut out the glareof the day, it shut out the noises of the street, and it seemed toshut out the entire malicious power of the world.  Inside the cruelsunshine became kindly shade and comforting candle-light; the onlysound was the occasional footfall of an unseen suppliant, and on thedistant high altar, shimmering and white at the end of the longperspective of the empty aisle, there rested the power she believedmore powerful than all on earth beside.She made her confession--not the easy and formal confession of thestrong, who need it most, but the frank probing question and fullreply of the weak, who can profit by it least--and at its end shereceived not only the benediction that she traced to Heaven, but theshrewd advice that came direct from the big heart of a worldly-wiseand beneficent man.\"Thank you, father,\" she added to the words of the ritual, as sherose to go, \"I\\'ll do me best to stick it out, but times be when it\\'spowerful hard.\"The experience had encouraged her, but, when she came at last intoher barren home, there fell a blow that shook to its foundations thestructure of hope which she had so briefly reared.  On the bare tablewas a single sheet of paper, and on the paper was written:\"Dear Katie:--I have gone away.  There was no use in saying good-by,for that would only have hurt both of us, and I could not have madeyou see that I was right not to board here any longer at yourexpense, any more than you could make me see last night that you wereright on your side.  Pretty soon I\\'ll come to see you and bring themoney I owe you, but I can\\'t ever pay you back all your othergoodness, although I would give my right arm to do it.\"Another thing.  By the time you get this letter Hermann will be tosee you at the store.  I was around to Bellevue yesterday, and wekept it as a surprise for you that he was coming out to-day.  I hopeby this time you two will have fixed it all up; but if you haven\\'t,well, I never talked to you about it much before, but I feel I mustsay something now, because I seem to know more about life than I usedto: take him, Katie dear, for there are only horrors ahead for anygirls like you and me if we don\\'t marry.  He\\'s a fine man and youlove him, and the two of you will do better together than you can doapart.\"Now, good-by.  Don\\'t please bother to hunt for me--I won\\'t be onpicket-duty any more, but _I am all right_.  \"Lovingly,      \"CARRIE.\"Katie Flanagan put down the note.  She went to the narrow window andgazed blindly at the unsightly wing of the tenement across the narrowcourt outside.\"All right?\" she said, the paper crumpling in her tightened hand.\"All right?  The poor girl\\'s got no money an\\' no job.  I know whatshe\\'s thinking an\\' there\\'s no good followin\\'.  \\'All right,\\' she says!Dear God, pity her: she means, \\'all wrong\\'!\"Katie felt too deeply for her lost comrade to think much, if at all,of that portion of the note which touched her own interest.  Her eyesclouded; her shoulders shook; she fell upon her knees before thewindow-sill, and it was there that Hermann\\'s strong arms went abouther neck.Even then, glad as she was to have him back again, she could dolittle but sob brokenly with her cheek against his breast, while hetold her how he had gone to the store, learned of her dismissal, andcome at once to the tenement, not pausing to knock when he heard hersobs.  He comforted her as best he could, but it was some time beforeany comfort availed.All had ended well for Hermann, but all had not easily so ended.  Hiswound had proved relatively slight, and he was sound and whole again:but, the day before his dismissal from the hospital, Schleger hadwaited upon him shamefacedly to confess that the rulers of the ward,dissatisfied with the bar-keeper\\'s Laodicean attitude toward theirpolitical labors, and urged by Mirka\\'s friends, had forbidden hisre-engagement in the saloon.  Ludwig had been sorry, but helpless,and then, after exacting a score of promises, had disclosed his planto open incognito a grocery-store on the West Side, himself remainingin charge of the saloon and Hoffmann appearing, on a good salary, asthe owner of the new venture.Katie looked up at him with eyes shining blue through a dispersingmist of tears.\"An\\' what about the dirty Dago that shot you?\" she inquired.Hermann smiled broadly.  His face was thinner and not so ruddy asonce, but it was cheerful still and more determined than of old.\"The Austrian?\" he asked.\"\\'Tis the same thing,\" said she.\"Ach, vell, I guess ve von\\'t do nussing about him.\"\"You won\\'t be lettin\\' him go?\"\"Vhy not?  Dere\\'s none to swear fur me and a hun\\'red to swear furhim.  I kind of belief Schleger gif me de new blace as brice furkeepin\\' quiet, so dere\\'s nussing to gain und efferysing to lose.\"At first she would not hear of it, and she used her opposition tothis dropping of the charge against Mirka as if it were an argumentproperly formed to oppose the next scheme that he proposed to her.But he had found her in her moment of weakness when he had come toher in his hour of strength renewed.\"No,\" he said firmly, \"und dis evenin\\' ve\\'ll be married.  I got derlicense; I stopped at der church; Father Kelly\\'s vatin\\'--dis evenin\\',Katie.\"The world was slipping from beneath her feet.  She did not answer.\"In two year\\',\" he went on, \"one part of dot store ve\\'ll own.  Katie,it\\'s our chance; und in de meanvhile, if der Herr Gott sends derbabies--und pray Gott he vill--dey von\\'t at least do no vorse as vehof done.\"He drew her tighter, but she twisted in his arms and got free, sothat he held only one of her firm hands.  They stood there face toface, between them the unfathomable chasm of sex, their feettrembling at its brink.Across the areaway the straight shafts of the setting sun caught thedirty little window-panes of the nearby squalid rooms and turned themto a shining glory.  The rays were reflected into Katie\\'s own room;they burnished the cheap paper into cloth of gold, they touched thefloor and gilded it, they made of the rickety table a thing ofsplendor, and of the worn chairs fairy thrones.  Hermann\\'s blondehead was crowned with a halo, and as he looked at the girl, againstthe background of those yellow windows like a Madonna against thebackground that the Etruscan painters loved, he saw in her eyes whathe had never seen before.In the momentary struggle the coils of her black hair had loosenedand fallen below her waist.  They framed a face no longer strong withrestraint, handsome from the flush of battle against the world, nolonger set and self-reliant, but a face through which shone the lightof the life-force, the motive-power of the universe, a beautifulface, white, frightened, wonderful.\"Can--can you really love me?\"She scarcely said the words.  Rather her lips formed them with novoice behind.  But he had heard her before her lips so much as moved.\"Ach,\" he cried, \"I hof alvays lofed you, Katie, but now it issomesing new und more.  Katie, I sink--I belief sings I neffer beliefbefore, und I sink it must be der blessing of Gott dot I can _see_ inyou.\"\"An\\' there won\\'t be anny other woman?\"\"You are _all_ vomen, Katie.\"She raised her head.\"Yes, Hermann,\" she said, \"I think I will be all women for you.  Iwill be all you want.  I will work an\\' share, good luck an\\' bad.  Inever before was glad I knew how to work, but now I _will_ be all youwant--all, _all_!\"He put her hand to his lips, and held it there an instant: FifthAvenue does these things, casually, no better than the Bowery, whenthe Bowery has a mind for them.\"Katie,\" he whispered.She took her hand away.  She tried to laugh a little, but thelaughter, clear and silvery, caught suddenly in her throat.  Hermouth twisted, and she raised the hand and put her lips where his hadbeen.Reeling with the tremor of that sight, his arms recaptured her, andthis time held her fast.  She swayed and yielded.  Her own armsanswered his, and his lips met, for the first time freely, the lipsshe had so bravely kept for him.The case against Mirka was then and there dismissed, and the HighCourt handed down a final decision _in re_ Hoffmann _vs._ Flanagan.XXIVMARIAN\\'S WAYWesley Dyker looked with unaffected approval about the second-storyfront room in Rivington Street.  He saw the calmly colored walls, theexcellent mats upon the floor, the ordered writing-desk and, near thecenter, the heavy library-table, covered with carefully piledmagazines.\"Hello!\" he said, nodding easily to the woman that stood motionlessbefore him.The woman\\'s answer was not ready, but Dyker, whose eyes were onsurroundings almost as animate, pursued:\"Upon my word, you have it rather cozy here, considering theneighborhood.  I\\'m not half so well fixed myself.  I\\'m glad to seethat, Marian, and I\\'m more than glad to see you.\"He raised his heavy lids to look at her.  He had resolved when, ashort while before, she had sent for him, to make no mention of theirlong separation.  He was sure that the sending meant he was to have achance to recall to her the superior wisdom that had expressed itselfin his advice against working among the poor; but of the time thathad elapsed since that advice was given he had meant to say nothing.Always he had confidently expected this moment, and, now that it hadcome, she must find him prepared.  He put out his hand.But Marian was thinking of how, in this same room, she had saidgood-by to Mary.  She compressed her lips a moment before answering,and, when she did answer, it was only to say, quite calmly:\"I don\\'t want to shake hands with you, Wesley.\"Day and night the words that Mary had so innocently droppedconcerning Dyker had stirred the fire in Marian\\'s breast.  Supposingthat her protégée had shared with Rose the easy caresses of Wesley,even at a time when Marian had been on the point of accepting them,the failure of that protégée to return to the Settlement for aid orconsolation had made Marian the prey to a hundred contendingemotions.  She was glad that Mary had not come back, because Maryadrift meant Mary suffering.  She was sorry that Mary had not comeback, because she wanted to ask the girl so many things that she hadat first neglected to ask.  She doubted Mary and was ashamed of herdoubts; she doubted Dyker and was still ashamed.  One thought tore atanother, and all tore at her heart.On entering the Settlement she had left Dyker in a proud anger thatforbade her acting upon his offer to come to her whenever she shouldsend for him; on dismissing Mary she had so framed her promise ofsecrecy that she might repeat to Wesley the unfortunate woman\\'sunconscious accusation; and on twisting and turning the reptilianthing over in her mind, she said in one breath that she could notsend for Dyker and could not be at peace unless she did send.  Thefiercest passion that a conventional woman has is the passion for theknowledge that will most likely clinch her unhappiness.  Marian wascertain that she must know the truth, and she told herself that shewas certain of but one fact beside: that she did not love this man;that she had never loved him--and, presumably because of that, shehad at last, on this day shortly after the election, incontinentlytelephoned to him to come to Rivington Street.She had said to herself that it was unfair to condemn him unheard.She had replied to herself that she did not care enough about himeither to condemn or to acquit.  She had ended by the realizationthat, deny it as she might, the fact of condemnation remained; andshe had inclined solely toward the attitude of impartial justiceuntil, in the briefest possible time after receiving her message,Dyker had entered this room.  Then, immediately, her mood had oncemore changed, as it was to change so often during the ensuinginterview; she had left the bench and had become the prosecutor.Perhaps Dyker\\'s appearance was in part to blame for this.  She had,of course, not seen him since that summer parting; it is seldompleasant for a woman to find that separation from her has left noscar upon an admirer, and it is always annoying to adistrict-attorney to detect no consciousness of guilt in thecountenance of the accused; yet Dyker had come into her presence witha buoyant step and a ready smile.  The pressure of campaigning hadlessened, though it could not wholly check, the progress of hisdissipations, and his face still flaunted the tokens of its formerglory.  His eyes were not noticeably more timid than of old, and hismouth was, as of old, hidden.  Add to this the pleasure, still fresh,of his election, and the satisfaction of a man fancying himself justplaced in a position to say \"I told you so\" to the woman he loves,and it will be seen that Magistrate Dyker, if not at his best, hadbeen at least in a moment of expansion.And now she had said that she would not take his hand!  He couldscarcely believe his ears.\"You don\\'t want--I am afraid I do not understand you, Marian,\" hesaid.Her great brown eyes looked steadily into his puzzled gaze.\"Sit down, please,\" she responded.Mechanically, he drew a deep wicker chair to the window, and obeyedher.She sat opposite him and, for fully a minute, while with gallopingbrain he watched her, she looked through the glass at crowded,shuffling Rivington Street.\"It is simple enough, Wesley,\" she at last resumed.  \"Before I canthink of renewing anything like my old friendly attitude towardyou----\"\"Your friendly attitude!\"\"It was scarcely more than that.  Before I can renew it, there issomething that must be explained.\"Dyker\\'s own attitude was still that of the average lover, and theaverage lover cannot see beyond his own shadow.\"Oh,\"--he was momentarily relieved and prepared, in consequence, toshow a proper magnanimity--\"you needn\\'t explain, Marian!  I knew youwould find that I was right, and that this was no place for you.  Iappreciate perfectly how you feel: you have been disappointed anddisillusioned, and it is like you handsomely to want to confess thatyou were wrong.  But let\\'s merely consider that done, and say no moreabout it.\"He ended in a warmth of good feeling; but the did not seem inclinedto accept this proffer, and, as he paused, he wondered what was inher gaze.\"No,\" she said, \"you are not quite correct in your surmise.  I havebeen disappointed and disillusioned.  I have been disappointed in oneof the people among whom I have been working; but I have beendisillusioned in regard to you.\"She stopped.  He began to guess now what was back of those calm eyesof hers.  Disillusioned in regard to him?  At the first breath itseemed incredible, but at the next his mind filled with the ghosts ofhis experience, the grim figures that compose the pageant of thatreal life of a man, upon which he never raises the curtain for thefeminine eyes most dear to him.\"In regard to me?\" he echoed.  He was wondering, in hidden panic,which especial image had been revealed to her, and he sought defensein general denial.  \"You have been listening to East Sideneighborhood gossip, Marian, and I shouldn\\'t have believed it of you.You have heard one of the hundreds of groundless ante-election libelsthat are the common ammunition used against anyone in politics.\"Her face, always fair, was gently tinted.\"What I have heard,\" she replied, \"I heard from somebody that hasnothing to do with politics.\"\"Down here,\" insisted Dyker, still seeking to dislodge the enemy andforce it into the open field of recognition, \"down here all the menhave something to do with politics.\"\"This was a woman, Wesley.\"He had feared that.  He had feared it when she first spoke of comingto the Settlement.  But he wasted no time in such thought; he must,before he committed himself, discover which of several possiblewomen, was concerned.\"Oh,\" he laughed, \"the women are mixed up in political gossip, too;or, at any rate,\" he added, \"they are always glad to repeat whattheir menfolk don\\'t hesitate to tell them.\"\"The woman I refer to was a part of the thing she told.\"Marian said it softly, but her white throat trembled.Dyker looked at her swiftly, and as swiftly lowered his eyes.Instantly now he guessed what it was that she had heard; an instantmore and he thought the thing improbable.  Then, resolved at allevents not to approach self-betrayal by showing his intuition, heassumed the point of view of the lawyer.\"Marian,\" he said, pulling at his mustache that she might see--as shedid--that his hand was steady, \"is this fair?  Is it right to condemnme on a charge of which I know nothing and because of evidence ofwhich I haven\\'t heard a syllable?\"\"No,\" she answered, \"it isn\\'t fair.  That is why I sent for you.\"He bit his lip, but faced her.\"Well,\" he said, \"what is it?\"Steadily she met his renewed gaze until his eyes failed her.Even then her own eyes, never wavering, could find in him not enoughto determine her.  The desire to get at the truth, whatever the truthmight be, was plying its angry whip upon her shoulders.  When Maryhad spoken, Marian had received the intelligence as innocentlyimparted fact.  But now the man before her gave nothing that herinexperience could set down as a sign of what she considered a greatsin.\"Wesley,\" she began, leaning towards him, \"the girl that told me thistold it inadvertently.  More than that, she did not even know that Ihad ever heard of you.  She did not want to hurt you: she wasgrateful to you, because you had rescued her.\"His intuition, then, had not failed him: it was Violet.\"Why,\" he smiled, his heart heavy with the fear of losing Marian\\'slove, his lips still sparring for a more open lead, \"I am afraid I\\'mno knight-errant, Marian, to go about rescuing damsels in distress.\"But he did not like the sound of the phrase, and, seeing that sheliked it no better, he explained: \"You surely remember how I feelabout these poor women.\"\"But she said that your politics brought you into touch with theworst sort of them.\"Marian paused there to give him another chance, but his only protestwas:\"Not my politics.  The duties of my profession, before I was electeda magistrate, sometimes made it necessary to defend such women.  Youmust have known that.  There was no dishonor there.\"\"And my informant added,\" continued Marian, \"that you used yourpolitical influence to gain their friendship, perhaps even to protectthem, and\"--she felt the depths before her; her cheeks went hot; herbrown eyes filled--\"and certainly to--to----\"She faltered.He felt it and looked up with anger in his eyes.\"To what?\" he demanded.She clasped her damp hands tight.\"To live with them,\" she said.Though he had expected the implication, he had hardly expected soclose an approach to the specific, and therefore the start to whichit behooved him to give way was not altogether disingenuous.\"Marian!\" he cried.She bent her head.\"Do you believe that?\" he asked.The accusation uttered, sick uncertainty gripped and tossed her again.\"I don\\'t know what to believe.\"\"But how can you think I would be capable of such things?  The girllied.\"Her judgment swayed dizzily.  Between word and word she was now forand now against him.\"I can\\'t think of any motive that this girl might have to lie,\" shesaid.\"How do you know what motive she has?\" returned Dyker, realizing inwhat good stead his training as a pleader of bad cases might standhim.  \"How do you know what political enemies of mine may have senther to you?  You say that, on her own confession, she is a vilewoman----\"\"I did not say that.\"\"You said she charged herself with being part of this allegedbusiness.  You confessed that you were disappointed in herpersonally.  What possible credit can be given to the story of awoman that begins by admitting such abominations?\"Marian tried to speak, but indecision choked her.\"I tell you, you were tricked,\" he pursued, with a glib rapidity thatshe did not know whether to attribute to innocence or guilt.  \"I mayhave lost a case for some friend of this girl.  I may have won a suitagainst one of her hangers-on.  There are men in the lower sort ofpolitics, I\\'m ashamed to say, that don\\'t hesitate to use such tools,and I have offended a good many of them.  Before you considered thisstory true, don\\'t you feel that you should have thought of one ofthese explanations?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" Marian faltered.  The relentless tide of her emotionsnow set in again in his favor.  Mary had told her story so calmly,with so little feeling concerning her own sufferings, that Mariankept wondering if it might not have been an invention.  She was surethat, all along, somewhere in her heart, she had wanted to think thebest of him; wanted, despite her accusing jealousy, to acquit him.\"I don\\'t know,\" she repeated despairingly; \"but\"--and the tide beganto flow once more--\"unless I can be certain of her motive for lyingto me, don\\'t you see, Wesley, don\\'t you see that I must have proof ofyour innocence from you?\"She looked at him in wide appeal.  The undertow had caught her, andshe was crying for help from shore.  She knew now that she loved him,and she had learned the ultimate tragedy of love: that love andmistrust may be one.\"How can I know anything?\" she went on.  \"How can I be sure ofanything?  How can I understand such a world as this?  It seems as ifall the earth was lying to me, and as if all the earth could lie andstill look honest.  I trusted the girl; I trusted you.  I beg of youto prove to me that I was right only when I trusted you.Wesley,\"--she almost extended her arms to him--\"tell me that youdidn\\'t do it!\"Dyker saw his advantage, but decided that the way to keep it was tobe firm.  He spoke quickly, yet coldly.\"Who was this woman?\" he asked.\"Do you think I ought to tell you?\" she pleaded.\"Ought to tell me?  Why, Marian, how else am I to prove what you askme to prove?  If you are to be at all fair with me, how can you startby hiding the false witnesses against me?\"He was right, she felt.\"Did you ever hear,\" she asked, \"of Mary Morton?\"Too late to weigh his words he remembered the name that the girl whomhe had called Violet had signed to her affidavit.  Before thatrecollection was clear to him, he made his reply in the deceit thatis the refuge of all the confused.\"I never did.\"\"You are sure?\"\"Absolutely\";--he had to keep it up now--\"although, if she is thesort of woman she says she is, she probably has as many aliases as asafe-cracker.\"\"But this girl--I should think you would not forget her if you hadever known her: she must have been good-looking once.  She has blueeyes and brown hair.  You could see from her face that she hassuffered, but you could see that she used to be almost beautiful.She has the walk of a queen.\"\"I don\\'t know her.\"\"Think.\"--Marian was still intent upon certainty.--\"When I saw hershe was both times dressed alike, though on her second visit herclothes, first new, had grown a little shabby.  She wore a cloak--Iforget its color, but it was dark--and a beaver hat.  She----\"He knew those clothes; he had reason to; but his interruption was instrict accord with his previous denial:\"There are thousands of women answering that vague description.  I amsure, however, that I don\\'t know this one.\"Marian did not observe that, on his own showing, his assurance waswithout foundation.  Her words had brought Mary vividly before herand, for a minute, she well-nigh forgot her own distress in themisery of that figure.\"She has had a great deal of trouble,\" said Marian.  \"Why, from whatshe told me, these girls must be worse treated than the blacks in theCongo; they must be far worse off than our own American negro slavesused to be.\"\"No doubt--if what she said was true.  But I know it was not true.My profession has made me see a great deal of these poor women, and Iknow that if they are slaves it is because they want to be.\"  Hewaved away the whole matter with a toss of his hand.  He wanted someinformation, and he did not want to show why he wanted it.  \"That allgoes to prove that if it was she who told you this foul story aboutme, then the story was that of a born liar,\" he declared.  \"You sayshe was here twice.  What were the circumstances?\"She told him.He breathed more freely.  He had only to convince Marian and get herto quit her work in disgust before further gossip should reach her.\"And so you don\\'t know her?\" she concluded.\"No.\"\"Nor Mrs. Rose Légère?\"\"I certainly know of that person,\" he said--it was the part of wisdomto admit some knowledge.  \"Nobody that knows anything about ourpolice-courts, as I have had to know, can be entirely ignorant ofher.  She is one of the most notorious women in New York.  I know agreat deal about her, but, except for one occasion, when I saw her ina station-house, I have never set eyes on her in my life.\"He spoke with such precision that Marian caught a gratified breath.\"Is she another Settlement visitor?\" inquired Wesley, devoutly hopingthat no miracle of reformation had, since their last meeting, beenwrought upon Rose.\"No, she is not.  It was she that was said to have been one ofyour--your friends, until she made friends with your politicalenemies.  The girl that told me was, of course, the Mary Morton Ihave mentioned.  She said that you were intimate with this Mrs.Légère, and I understood that even Mary----\"Dyker was genuinely glad to find some accusation that he could denywith truth.\"Never!\" he cried.Something in that word and his utterance of it made her look at himhard.\"She didn\\'t want to tell the story,\" Marian insisted.  \"I got it fromher.  How could it have been the result of malice or a plot?  Didn\\'tI tell you that she said you had rescued her from the Légère woman\\'shouse?\"Dyker reflected.  He wished that he had been as sweeping in hisdiscrediting of Violet, under the pseudonym of Mary Morton, as he hadbeen in his discrediting of Rose.  Failing that, he might even haveexplained this rescue and have become something of a hero.  Bothopportunities were, however, gone.  He must make the best of whatremained.\"Marian,\" he said, speaking slowly, quite calmly, and with no smallappearance of sincerity of purpose, \"I needn\\'t bring you any proof ofthis Légère woman\\'s bad character--the qualities of that characteryou yourself know--and as for this Morton girl, I can only fall backon what I have already pointed out to you.  You say she confesses herevil life: how can you, then, credit anything an admittedly abandonedcreature may have told you?\"\"Can\\'t the worst of women tell the truth sometimes?\"\"Practically never.\"\"But,\"--Marian passed a weary hand across her forehead--\"how couldthis girl be in a position to know what she says she knows, if shehadn\\'t led just the kind of life that you say makes her an inevitableliar?\"It was an excellent sort of answer.  Dyker tossed his head.\"I am hurt, Marian,\" he said.  \"I thought you had some faith in me; Ithought you knew me.  I don\\'t see how you can persist in thisattitude--how you can say these things.  Why, I have been in yourhouse: I have known you and your father; whereas thesepeople--Marian, I love you; why should I lie to you?\"She had been keeping her hand upon her forehead, but she lowered itnow to her eyes, where it was joined by its mate.\"I don\\'t know,\" she moaned.  \"That\\'s just it: I don\\'t know.\"\"Then what,\" he asked, \"can I do to convince you?  I won\\'t upbraidyou; I won\\'t be harsh.  My sane course would be to pay no attentionto accusations from such a character as this Mary Morton, and yoursane course would be to pay no attention to them.  But I know howthings are in this neighborhood; I know the bad atmosphere you havebeen breathing ever since you came down here.  Long ago I told youexactly what would happen; I foresaw it all.  I told you when youinsisted on going into this work that these women would poison yourmind, distort your vision, make you doubt all that is best in life.Apparently, they have succeeded; but I don\\'t speak of that.  Marian,unless it was in some police-court--perhaps at the time I saw RoseLégère--I never saw this girl in my life.  I don\\'t understand herenmity any better than you do.  It may spring from some imaginedwrong to one of her friends, or it may be a political plot.  But,except as it affects your regard for me, I don\\'t care anything aboutit.  All that I do care about, all that I do want to accomplish is torestore you to a normal view of things, get you out of these foulmental and material surroundings, and bring you back to your ownproper world.  I want to do this and to make you know the truthconcerning myself.  Tell me what will bring this about, and I\\'ll doit without a moment\\'s loss of time.\"He thought that, in the nature of the case, there was nothing verydifficult or inconvenient that she could demand; but he had countedtoo much on the artificial and too little upon the natural andprimitive woman.Her face still hidden, she felt the full force of his appeal, but thetempest had its wild will of her.  She believed him guilty; shebelieved him innocent.  She believed that, if he were guilty,temptation had come from the woman; she believed that, if he wereinnocent, there was nevertheless something--she did not knowwhat--that he was hiding from her.  Faith was ready to destroy much,but would not jealousy destroy more?  Her jealousy had consumeddignity, it had ravaged custom, it was burning restraint.Mary\\'s words had drawn in Marian\\'s mind a concrete picture, and thecontemplation of that picture had awakened an anger in which hergenuine love had for the first time genuinely expressed itself.Before, she could have heard with light regret of Dyker\\'s engagementto marry another woman.  Before, she might herself have drifted withhim through a placid wooing into the port of marriage that, untilthis revelation, she had in no wise understood.  But now she sawthings specifically, and in the element of the specific the qualitythat she had known as \"womanliness\" was dissolved and the thing thatshe at last knew to be Woman was evolved.The issue, she was thus still determined, depended upon proof ofinnocence.  He must be clean, and she must know it.She uncovered her fine face, strangely stronger for its grief.\"Wesley,\" she said, \"I do remember all that you told me these womenand this work would do to me.  If you prove to be wrong, I shall stayon here, and, of course, never see you again; but if you prove to beright I shall give it up, and then, Wesley, I shall marry you.\"He rose with a glad cry; but she, rising also, waved him back.\"Not yet,\" she said.  \"Either find Mary Morton and the proofs thatshe is dishonest--not only what I know she is, but dishonest in whatshe would say and do--show me this, or else----\"With straining resolution, he confronted her.\"Or else?\" he prompted.\"Or else bring her to me with her own denial and explanation.\"XXVDAUGHTERS OF ISHMAELWhen Mary left Rivington Street she faced the inevitable.  She hadseen the impossibility of domestic service; she knew nothing of anyother trade; she could not endure the shame of an institution, andher fortune consisted of just fourteen dollars and fifty cents.She walked, for a long time, aimlessly.  The night thickened and,block by block, the streets flashed into electric illumination, eachseparate flame glowing like a malevolent eye to show her misery.  Herstrength, never yet fully restored, failed her.  Her feet were tired,her knees bent irregularly, her head ached.  As at her first sight ofit, the city, which she knew scarcely better than on that springevening when she had been tossed into it, was a conscious prisonimplacably shutting her in forever.She walked westward, and then northward.  She dodged across FifthAvenue among the automobiles of careless, comfortable people on theirways to one place or another of swift enjoyment.  She passed anotorious café at the warm windows of which she saw, seated at ladentables and opposite leering men, the painted faces of softly gownedwomen, the more successful examples of what she soon must be.  Andshe came to hurrying Broadway through whose crowds she saw silentlyand cunningly darting, with smiling hate written on their tired,rouged lips, the girls whose dawn was the lighting of thestreet-lamps and from whom she wanted to ask for instruction in theone means of livelihood that remained to her.Her soul was as weakened and vitiated as her body, and by much thesame forces.  Into her escape from Rose\\'s, into her work at Mrs.Turner\\'s, into her appeal to the employment-agency and her tasks atMrs. Chamberlin\\'s she had put every particle of strength that shecould harness, and the result had always been failure.  The socialsystem was too mighty.  She could not prevail against it.  She mustdo its bidding, and since it was so impractically constituted as tobid her prey upon it, her sole solace must be found in preyingfiercely.She turned into a cross-street, full of refulgent drinking-placesthat beckoned by swinging doors, behind which were the voices ofsingers and through which passed, in alone and out with shame-facedmen, unending streams of women with white faces and vermillion mouthsand sadly encircled eyes.  But Mary pressed westward, though she didnot clearly know her intention until, having crossed two avenues, shefound that the cafés gave place to small shops, and that the shopswere giving place to tall, moldy buildings with long stairways beforethem, houses that had once, plainly, made homes, but that were now,as plainly, barracks for lodgers.From one of these she saw come a slight girl under a huge hat heavywith two great plumes.  Mary waited until this girl drew near, firsthesitated when she observed that the girl was scarcely fifteen, thenspoke when she noted the bedizened dress and the face of which thechildish beauty had been trained to maturity and hardness.\"Can you tell me if I can get a room around here?\" she inquired.The girl\\'s knowing eyes studied her.\"Hello!\" she said.  \"When did you hit the road?\"\"To-day.  I want to find a room.\"\"Well, you can\\'t go wrong.  The house I live in is full-up; but youcan ring \\'most any bell along here and get what you want.  Thereain\\'t no choice.  One\\'s as bum as another.\"She nodded saucily and went on her way, and Mary climbed the steps ofthe first house she came to.Her ring was answered by a woman that appeared, as far as Mary couldobserve in the faint light, to be about sixty years old.  Her hairwas gray and severely arranged; her dress was shabby, and she lookedvery tired.  To Mary she did not seem to be at all the type thatwould conduct the sort of place which the wanderer just then needed.\"Can you rent me a room?\" she nevertheless inquired.\"With privileges?\" asked the woman.It was a phrase new to its hearer, but she understood that itdescribed the kind of room she wanted.\"Yes,\" she almost whispered.But the woman did not lower her voice.  Her descent, as Maryafterwards learned, had been by slow stages, and her complaisance hadbeen enforced through a history that began with the establishment ofa respectable boarding-house, when a reform-election had driven herhusband from the police-force, passed through a widowhood imposedupon by absconding lodgers and raised house-rents, and ended by theadmission of first one and then many patrons that were, though theywanted what she had not always cared to give, at least certain to paywhat she had to turn over to the church-corporation that owned theproperty.\"I got a nice second-floor front, just a step from the bath-room, ateighteen dollars,\" she said.\"A month?\" inquired Mary.The woman regarded her as if she were somewhat of a curiosity.\"Certainly not: eighteen a week.\"\"Oh, I--I couldn\\'t afford that.\"\"It\\'s a nice room.\"\"Yes, I guess it is, but----\"\"I might let it to you for fifteen, to start with.\"\"I couldn\\'t afford it.\"\"Well, there\\'s the parlor.  It\\'s only twelve, an\\'ll be vacantto-morrow.\"\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to get a place for to-night.  Haven\\'t youanything cheaper?\"\"You don\\'t seem to know nothin\\' about prices, miss.\"  The landladyappeared to reflect.  \"But there\\'s the third-floor back hall-room,\"she added; \"I can let you have it for seven, an\\' better than that youcan\\'t do anywheres.\"Mary hesitated.\"You can easy make three times that much,\" the woman urged.\"Do you----\"  Mary wet her dry lips.  \"Do you think so?\"\"Think so?  Why, the lady that had that room for a whole year tilllast week made as high as twenty dollars a night.  She moved out o\\'here to her own flat.  But then, she was good-looking, of course.\"Mary had entertained some vague notion of a small gas-stove, and somesaving in the matter of meals; but this the landlady could in no wisepermit.\"The insurance sharks won\\'t allow it,\" she said, and concluded in atone that showed the later fact to be of more importance: \"Besides,it so runs up the gas-bills.\"Mary said no more.  She paid for a week in advance, and was shown atonce to the cell she had leased so dearly.It was a little, gaudily-papered room scarcely fifteen feet long andnot much more than two-thirds that in width.  A stationary washstandwas so placed that the door could not open freely.  At the singlenarrow window stood an unsteady table of no apparent purpose, andalong the side a clothes-press and a narrow, pine bureau.  The bed,however, was the chief feature of furniture, and that was large andcomfortable.\"I\\'ll give you clean sheets every Sunday morning regular,\" said thelandlady; \"but any changes you want between you\\'ll have to pay forthe washin\\' of.\"She demanded, and received, twenty-five cents for a latch-key, addedthat she permitted no noise in the rooms, and departed, leaving Marysitting on the edge of the bed.The girl\\'s experiences in the house of Rose Légère had prepared herbut imperfectly for this adventure.  It was a new business, and Marydid not know how to embark upon it.  She was as lost as thechorus-girl, unused to the purchase of railway tickets and theengaging of \"hotel-accommodations,\" who finds herself stranded in asmall town.She went to the bureau and looked at herself in its distortingmirror, in an effort to appraise her wares.  Her hollow cheeks neededrouge.  Her dull eyes needed belladonna.  Her clothes were worn.  Shefelt that she should start work immediately, but she was afraid.  Shewent to bed and slept.By the next evening she had spent all but a dollar and some few centsof the seven dollars and a quarter that had remained to her.  Withher bundles under her aching arm, she was returning to herlodging-house to prepare for work, when she stopped at the \"Ladies\\'Entrance\" of the corner-saloon and, going into a bare apartment for adrink of whiskey, found, seated at a table, as the only othercustomer, the girl of whom she had asked her questions on the nightbefore.The child smiled as pleasantly as her hardened face would permit.\"Hello, kid,\" she said.  \"How\\'s tricks?\"\"Hello,\" replied Mary.\"Sit down here,\" said the girl.Mary accepted her invitation, and gave the grinning waiter her order.\"Got settled?\" asked the girl, when the waiter had come and goneagain.\"Yes,\" replied Mary, \"I got a room.\"\"Where?\"\"The fifth door from here.\"The girl whistled.  She was proud of her knowledge.\"That old cat Charlotte Michaels!\" she commented.  \"I bet she stuckyou.\"\"She charges me seven dollars a week for a third-floor backhall-bedroom.\"\"Hell, that\\'s a steal.  Come next door to where I am, next week.There\\'ll be a better room there, then, for a dollar less.\"Mary looked at the child.  It seemed strange that she should be aboutto ask of one perhaps two years her junior for directions in the waysof the street; but she saw that the childishness before her waschildishness without innocence, was even lined and scarred by wisdom.She wondered about her own face.\"I\\'m goin\\' to start out to-night,\" she said.In the etiquette of this trade the workers ask no questions of oneanother and offer few biographies save those fictitious ones, thethreadbare, unimaginative lies, which they reserve for theirinquisitive purchasers.  Mary\\'s entertainer, therefore, put forwardno inquiries save one:\"New in this town?\" she asked.\"I\\'m new in the business,\" said Mary.The child eyed her doubtingly.\"Come off,\" she good-naturedly replied.\"Yes, I am.  I was in a house onc\\'t, but I\\'m new to this, an\\' I ain\\'tjust sure how to go about it.\"\"Oh,\" said the child, \"it\\'s dead easy to learn the curves, but it\\'sthe hardest job in the world.  Can\\'t your fellow put you wise?\"\"My fellow?\"\"Sure, your fellow, your friend, your sweetheart.  Honest, now; ain\\'tyou workin\\' for nobody?\"\"No.\"\"Well, you ought to be.  Most all the girls is.  You can\\'t get alongright without one.  Who\\'s goin\\' to go your bail when you\\'re pinched?\"\"Will I be pinched?\"\"About as often as onc\\'t a month, kid--unless you let the cop callonc\\'t a week.\"\"I guess I can stand him,\" said Mary.  She was past the stage ofobjections.\"You\\'ll have to pay him anyhow, you know.\"\"I thought I might have to.\"\"Then you thought dead right.  Why don\\'t you get a fellow?  They\\'slots of them.  They got political pulls.  Of course, they don\\'t leaveyou much money for yourself, but they certainly can fix things up foryou.\"\"Have you a fellow?\" asked Mary.\"I sure have,\" said the child, grandly.  \"My girl friend an\\' I havehad one between us ever since we left school last June.\"\"Does he treat you right?\"\"As good as any.  He beats us up once in a while when we don\\'t earnenough, or when he\\'s more than usual lit up.  But he keeps the copsaway, an\\' he gets us good trade, an\\' he\\'s true to the two of us.He\\'d ought to be; we make good money for him.\"Mary listened in a kind of awe.\"You like him?\" she asked.\"I love him,\" the child emphatically declared.  \"Lots of the girlshates their fellows, but daren\\'t leave \\'em because their fellows\\'dhave \\'em pinched right off--but I love mine.  You ought to get one.I\\'ll put you next.\"\"No,\" said Mary, \"I think I\\'ll wait; but I wish I knew the curves.\"\"Oh, hell; it\\'s dead easy, I tell you.\"  The child gulped her whiskeyand went on: \"You just put on your glad rags at eight o\\'clock an\\'walk Broadway from Twenty-third to Forty-second.  If you can hustle,you can land half a dozen before one o\\'clock.  When they give you theglad eye, take it, an\\' when they don\\'t, just you walk by \\'em sort ofhummin\\' under your breath.  Stop an\\' look in the store-windows, an\\'they\\'ll come like flies.  But always be sure to get your money first.Ask \\'em two dollars if they look that strong, or one if they\\'re cheapguys--but don\\'t ever take a cent less\\'n fifty cents.  I always getsthe two-plunk myself, unless a piker stands out for a dark corner orhallway and tries the quarter game: then I go through his clothes forall he\\'s got.\"Mary rose, with averted eyes.\"Thank you,\" she said.\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" said the child.  \"You just take my tip, an\\'you\\'ll make good.\"And, if by managing, by the most detestible sort of work, to keepclothes upon her back, food in her stomach and a roof over her head,was making good, Mary did it.  Everything fell out as the little girlhad described.  That night the adventurer, with no alternative, sankthe last of her scruples, and, when her room-rent next fell due, shepaid it and had a margin of several dollars to place in her stocking.There was not, she found, very much to be saved, for the whole worldseemed to mark her as legitimate prey.First, the policemen were quick to see that she was an unprotectednewcomer, and, one by one, to stop her and threaten her with arrest.In the beginning, she was afraid to slip them their tithes, and didit timidly and awkwardly; but, when she saw how jauntily andgraciously they accepted payment, she had the bills always ready atthe time when they were expected and, with the bills, the caressesthat, not infrequently, had to accompany them.Other expenses were proportionate.  Rent gained upon the advance ofprosperity.  Showy clothes, if not the best, were a necessity, andthe second-hand shops raised their prices on the suspicion of herprofession.  Rainy nights came, when there was almost no business tobe done.  The work was of a character that required sturdy food, andthis must be bought in restaurants tacitly conducted for her classand charging accordingly.  The men, she soon discovered, were asloath to buy her a supper as they were ready to buy her drinks, acondition the sole consolation of which was the fact that alcoholdulled whatever remained of the fine edge of sensibility.Some of her cursory Antonies, regarding their transactions as theyregarded their other business affairs, were honest, but most werehonest only when they had to be, and to them Mary and her kind werebeasts of burden not worthy of the stipulated hire.  There were thelechers that wanted only to waste the busy minutes in unremunerativetalk; there were the seekers that endeavored to secure throughhideous formulæ of affection what they were too mean frankly topurchase; there were the hypocritical male animals that, abovesuspicion in their daylight life, considered the women of the nightas fair game for cheating, and then there were the careful toads, whoprided themselves upon their shrewdness, and who bargained andhaggled as a man would be ashamed to bargain and haggle for a dog.It was a trade of hard hours, hard walking, and hard drinking, and,in the glaring cafés where she often sat with her fellow-workerswaiting to be smiled at by the hunters, Mary, though she met manygirls that fared worse than herself, met few that, when truthful,told of faring better.  The woman that quitted her landlady\\'s carefor \"a flat of her own\" represented the ideal toward which this wholearmy was hoping, but was an ideal mythical.Nearly all were working in health and out, and saving nothing.Nearly all were in bondage to taskmasters that slunk along after themthrough the streets, saw them strike a bargain, waited in the shadowsof a nearby house until the wage was paid, and then came forward,before the customer had turned the corner, to exact their tribute.Born, through the effects of a wasteful industrial system, in cellarsupon beds of rags, herded as children in attics where a family of tenslept in a space too small for five, bred in poverty, always underfedand never properly protected from the weather, some of them were usedto hardship that no decent social justice would ever have permitted.Others had been lured from comfortable homes.  Still others were thefaster fettered because they had gone from homes too respectable toallow of any return.  But almost everyone, through fear of exposure,dread of jail and reformatory, and awe of their owners\\' politicalinfluences, was the chattel of a slavery as thorough as that of whichMax Grossman was a minor instrument.The majority of these toilers were ready to receive, or had longsince received, the seeds of tuberculosis; few could continue theirwork for five years, and ninety-five per cent., as a drunken youngcollege undergraduate one evening cheerfully informed Mary, weresuffering from one or other, and sometimes from all three, of thetrio of diseases common to their business.  Out from those stuffybedrooms and those smoke-clouded, song-filled cafés, men carried thescourging social illnesses to innocent wives and to unborn childrendestined to dwarfed or sightless lives.  The sufferer might believehimself cured and bear infection years later.\"Now, take yourself, for instance,\" the lad had resumed, his cheeksstill rosy with youth, but his eyes aflame with liquor.  \"I knowsomething about these things; but I couldn\\'t tell whether you werefree or not.  You might be sick a long time before even you couldtell, and then you wouldn\\'t risk starvation by telling about it.  Youmight be sick right now for all I know.  But look out for the worstof all!\"Mary heard him with as little heed as she had heard most men.  Shehad learned all that he said from women who knew more of it than, shehoped, this boy would ever know, and she had been well assured thatit was a danger that no preventive could wholly defy and no care becertain to escape.After all, she used to reflect, nothing much mattered.  She hadnothing pleasant to look forward to and, therefore, she wiselyrefrained, save for one advancing idea, from looking forward.  Shehad no past that did not have its pain for her vision, and,therefore, with this sole exception, she resolutely kept her eyesupon the present day.Yet gradually one great passion was growing within her.  That processof thought which had begun in her encounter with Philip Beekman, whenshe left his mother\\'s employment, had been hastened in its growth bywhat Marian Lennox had said and failed to do, and the shock of thegirl\\'s embarkation upon her new profession had only momentarilyretarded it.  She was not large enough--few of us are--to see theconditions behind the individual, nor yet greatly to concern herselfwith individuals that did not directly concern her; but she sawclearly her own plight, and now saw, or thought she saw, that thisplight was due entirely to the machinations of the man who had takenher from her home and brought her to New York.  She could have lovedhim, and so she hated him; she could still feel a tenderness for whathe might have been, so she permitted herself to feel only animosityfor what he had proved himself to be.  To him she traced directly allthat had befallen her, and as she could not go beyond him, so fromhim, she slowly and finally resolved, she would exact payment.  Thatthought waxed in her tired mind; it was fed with every throe of herpained body until it dominated her circumscribed outlook upon theworld.  It even saved her from suffering, because it so possessed herthat it armored her against all lesser things.  She had found, atlast, a purpose in life.It was almost coincident with her realization of this that Maryrealized something else.  She went immediately to a physician.Dr. Helwig, a man with an enormous paunch and a round face and triplechin, was one of the many excellent practitioners that depend fortheir living--and it is a good one--upon the class to which Marybelonged.  He treated the matter for what it was: a commonplace inhis day\\'s work.  At the end of a week he confirmed her fears.For a moment she reeled under the blow.  The bookcases with theirponderous volumes in dark bindings, the shelves burdened with phials,the glass medicine-case, the convertible table for minor operations,the crowded desk, and even the fat physician before it, seemed towhirl in a mad saraband.\"Come, come!\" she heard the doctor say, as he thrust an uncorkedbottle of smelling-salts under her nose.\"How long will it last?\" she panted.\"We must keep up our treatment for six months or a year,\" heanswered.  \"Meantime, diet and quiet.  No liquor.  If you were amillionaire, I\\'d prescribe a long sea-voyage or a trip to HotSprings.\"Out of the chaos of her brain a sudden idea was shaping.\"What,\" she inquired, \"about other people catching this?\"He knew her business perfectly, and he knew that what he had to sayon this point would weigh but little in the scale against want.Nevertheless, he made the common answer.After that she listened to all the instructions that he gave her.More than ever now she had her purpose in life.XXVI\"THE LEAST OF THESE\"A week later, in a lamp-lighted street, Mary and Carrie met.  Eachgirl was too conscious of her own business to remark that it was thebusiness of her acquaintance, and each tried to avoid the other; butbefore recognition was complete they were face to face.  Silence wasconfession.  Mary spoke.\"Hello,\" she said, \"it\\'s a long time since I seen you.  How are you,anyways?\"Carrie, though still a homely girl, wore a close-fitting coat thatmade the best of her figure.  Her hat was wide and new and, as sheanswered, she turned from the light.\"Pretty well,\" she said, and paused short.\"I guess,\" said Mary, \"you thought it was queer, my never comin\\' tosee you; but I haven\\'t had a single chance.  I\\'ll come soon, honest Iwill.  How\\'s Katie?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" Carrie slowly answered, \"I\\'m not living with her anymore.\"\"You ain\\'t?  Since when ain\\'t you?\"\"Oh, I don\\'t know--a couple of weeks.\"\"You two didn\\'t scrap?\"\"No.  I had to go away.\"  And then, to divert the fire, Carrie added:\"Are you still working at that place the Settlement-people got foryou?\"\"No, I left that long ago.  Have you gone back to theshirtwaist-factory?\"\"I couldn\\'t: the strike was never settled, and, anyhow, they wouldn\\'thave taken me back if I\\'d been willing to go.\"Mary looked at the long coat and the gray hat.\"But, say,\" she began, \"you don\\'t look----\"Her eyes dropped to Carrie\\'s and, suddenly, she knew.  Her voicesoftened.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she said.  \"I had to do it, too.\"Silently they touched hands.  The Lithuanian\\'s breast rose and fellquickly.\"I couldn\\'t do anything else,\" said Carrie, but only in explanation,not in extenuation or excuse.  \"There was no other work I could do.\"\"I know,\" said Mary.\"And everywhere I went,\" continued Carrie, \"he followed me.  He wasalways just behind me when I walked, always just around the cornerwhen I stood still.  When I was dizzy and hungry, he always lookedwell fed and always had the money in his hand.  He waited, waited,waited.\"\"You mean your fellow?\" Mary asked.Carrie assented.  \"If you can call him that,\" she said.  \"He has twoor three others working for him, or he\\'d be across the street now.I\\'m different from them--freer.  I\\'m not afraid of him, and so he isa little afraid of me.\"Mary took the girl\\'s arm.\"They won\\'t let us stop this way on the pavement,\" she said.  \"Comein here and have a drink.\"They went into the women\\'s room of one of the quieter saloons.  Mary,mindful of the doctor\\'s directions, took only carbonated water, butCarrie ordered whiskey.Mary, with her stomach crying out for the alcohol, and, in thatwrenching desire, nearly seizing her companion\\'s liquor, sipped thewater.\"I\\'ve quit it,\" she averred.  \"It don\\'t pay.\"\"Most of the men make you take it,\" said Carrie.\"Yes,\" Mary admitted, \"but you can chuck it on the floor if you\\'refly.\"  She took another sip of the water, and then asked: \"Why don\\'tyou shake this man if you\\'re not scared of him.  You can come withme, you know.\"\"It wouldn\\'t be good business,\" Carrie declared.  \"I need somebodywith influence to look after me in case I\\'m arrested.\"Mary was silent for a minute, thinking.\"Perhaps you\\'re right,\" she granted; \"there\\'s one of \\'em I\\'d like tofind.\"\"Who is it?\"\"I\\'ll tell you sometime.--Look here: I don\\'t feel like workin\\'Broadway to-night, an\\' I\\'ve got some money.  Let\\'s do a dance-hall.\"They \"did\" several.  At the first a mask-ball was in progress; thebachanalian guests had rented extravagant costumes; confetti wastossed by the onlookers, and swiftly shifting lights of red and blue,of green and purple, played upon the dancers, whose whirling shadows,monstrously magnified, were thrown upon sheeted walls.  At another,there was an explosion of obscene epithets followed by a fight, whichmade retreat advisable; and at a third, the dances were so short andthe intervals provided for the solicitations of the waiters were solong that both girls wearied of the scene.On Tenth Avenue they at last found, however, a place more to theirliking.  It was the usual type of room, enlarged by tearing out thethin partitions that had once divided it into several tenements.  Thelights shone sick through the clouding smoke, and the air was heavywith the odors of dust, tobacco, alcohol, and sweat.  But the musicwas lively, the floor crowded, and the little tables along the wallswere surrounded by laughing groups of drinking men and women.  Of theformer, though most were hollow-chested, pale-cheeked, hawk-nosed,some showed clearly that they came to plunder; and if the majority ofthe latter were gum-chewing working-girls still in their earliestteens, many were of the variety to which the two newcomers nowbelonged.Mary and her companion sat down at a table near the door.  Theynodded to the burly, cigar-smoking \"Boss,\" who moved energeticallyabout, urging bloodless lads to find partners, and now and thenhimself taking a turn with a neglected girl.  They exchanged familiargreetings, though they had never before seen her, with thefalse-jeweled woman whose business it was to assist the boss instimulating the dancers by precept and example.  And they watched thescene with a gaze grave and calculating.Here a child of thirteen, with closed eyes and her peach-tinted cheekagainst her pimpled partner\\'s, undulated to the music, scarcelymoving her feet.  Nearby there whirled, like a dervish, a girl towhose consumptive face the revolutions brought a glow that mimickedhealth.  Now and then a woman would leap from one of the tables,embrace an unembarrassed man about the neck and so waltz off withhim, at once passionate and mocking, both of them deaf to theplaudits of their spectators.  From time to time the lights weresuddenly extinguished, and the dance went on in the darkness amid achorus of kisses, cries, and giggling.  Most of the boys and men, andnearly all of the little girls, were drunk.Among the dancers, doubtless plying his trade, Mary saw RafaelAngelelli, sleek and radiant in a new suit of pale buff.  He detectedher a little later and, disposing of a pure-faced child, who had beenin his arms, made a skillful way to his old acquaintance.  He shookMary\\'s reluctant hand and, nodding to Carrie as if she were afamiliar friend, sat down between the two women.\"Where you been?\" he affably inquired of Mary.\"Out of town,\" said Mary, coldly.Angel shrugged his shoulders.  He knew she lied, but he rarelycontradicted a lady.\"Meester Dyk\\' been lookin\\' all over theesa town for you, Violet,\" hesaid.Mary did not like the news.  She was still afraid that she might bewanted in connection with her contradictory affidavits.Angel, however, readily reassured her.  Just what Dyker wanted he didnot, he said, know; but he was certain that it was something for herbenefit.  The magistrate had commissioned him to find her, and Angelhad been searching, sporadically, for several weeks, even tracing hercourse back to the employment-agency and to that Mrs. Turner\\'s whereshe had first worked.\"Theesa woman say you steal,\" said the Italian.\"She\\'s a liar,\" answered Mary, hotly.\"She say she tol\\' you so.\"\"She tried to make out I took a cake of soap.\"\"But she say after you leave she meess two dollar an\\' some silkastockin\\'.\"\"That woman never wore no silk stockin\\'s in her life, an\\' therewasn\\'t two dollars in the house.\"Again the Italian shrugged his shoulders.  He gave Mary to understandthat, in his opinion, any woman who could steal and did not was afool, and that any woman who stole and acknowledged it was a worsefool.  But what, plainly, most interested him was the execution ofhis commission from Dyker.  He talked so earnestly about it that hefailed entirely to lay Mary\\'s fears.  She refused to give him heraddress, and as soon as he had left the table she endeavored to quitthe hall.The entrance of an acquaintance detained her.  There were words thathad to be said and drinks that had to be bought.  Half an hourpassed, and then, as she started with Carrie for the door, Mary sawWesley Dyker standing outside.  He was wrapped in a heavy overcoatwith its military collar turned up about his chin and his black derbypulled far over his eyes; but Mary feared him too much to fail ofrecognition.\"There he is!\" she whispered, catching her companion\\'s arm.  \"TheDago telephoned him.  I was afraid of that.\"Escape was hopeless.  She sent Carrie back to the dancers, and, goingout, met Dyker, her head erect.\"I heard you was lookin\\' for me,\" she said.Wesley raised his hat.\"Yes,\" he said dryly; \"walk a block or two with me.\"They went for some time in silence, Mary too much upon the defensiveto risk beginning a conversation, and Dyker trying in vain to commandthe anger that had been growing with every day since he had learnedhow she had betrayed him to Marian.  At the first dark street intowhich he turned her, his resentment burst its guard.\"What in hell do you mean by telling everybody all you know aboutme?\" he demanded.Mary shrank away.\"No, you don\\'t!\" he said, and seized her hand.  \"Didn\\'t I do you thebest turn that was ever done you?\"\"Yes,\" the woman quavered.  \"An\\' I wouldn\\'t pay you back the way yousay I done.  I never talked about you to nobody.\"\"Don\\'t lie.  You know you did.\"Mary remembered, but she shook her head determinedly.\"I\\'ve never once spoke your name,\" she said.\"I tell you to stop lying!\" rejoined Dyker.  \"You told it once at theSettlement on Rivington Street.  I know it.  I learned it theremyself.\"\"What did I tell?\" asked Mary.  Her tone was defiant, but herendeavor was to draw his fire.They walked forward.\"You said I hung out at Rose\\'s,\" he protested.  \"You said I was herlover and yours.\"\"I never said I had nothing to do with you, Mr. Dyker.  I don\\'t carewho told you I did; I never said no such thing.\"\"You said I went to Rose\\'s.  I know you did.\"She confessed to that, for she was truly sorry for it.\"But I didn\\'t mean to, Mr. Dyker,\" she added; \"honest, I didn\\'t.  Itjust slipped out.  I didn\\'t know Miss Marian knowed you.  Why, shetold me she didn\\'t know you, an\\' how\\'d I ever think she\\'d lie?\"That was a question which, ignorant of Miss Lennox\\'s precise methodof evasion, Wesley did not, even to himself, attempt to answer.\"It didn\\'t matter whether she knew me or not,\" he said; \"you had noright to tell it.\"\"I know that.  It just slipped out.  But it won\\'t never happen again.I wasn\\'t so wise as I am now.\"\"I hope not,\" he said, a trifle mollified by the sincerity in hertone.  \"But you\\'ve done me a big amount of harm there, Violet, andyou have got to undo it.\"Her first sensation had been one of relief in finding that her falseaffidavit was not held against her; her next had been fright at hisanger; but now she was all penitence for the ill she had wrought him.Dyker was the one man in New York that had done her a kindness, andshe held that kindness as the greatest possible.\"What do you want?\" she asked.  \"I\\'d do most anything for you, Mr.Dyker: you know that.\"They were under the uncertain light of a crossing.  He eyed hernarrowly, mistrustingly.\"I want you,\" he replied, \"to come to my office to-morrow evening atsix.  Here\\'s my card.  Will you do it?\"She took the card and thrust it through the opening of her shirtwaist.\"What do you want with me when you get me there?\" she wondered.\"I want you to come with me to Miss Lennox, and deny the story thatyou told her about me.\"Mary\\'s heart sank.  She could not bear the thought of facing Marian.\"What\\'s the use o\\' that?\" she pleaded.\"What\\'s the use?  Why, how else are you going to put me right withher?\"\"But I couldn\\'t.\"\"You must.\"\"I couldn\\'t, Mr. Dyker.  Honest, I couldn\\'t.  She\\'d know I was lyin\\'to her.\"\"You leave that to me.\"\"What excuse\\'d I give her?\"\"We\\'ll fix that up to-morrow.\"\"Please don\\'t make me do it, Mr. Dyker!\"\"I\\'ve got to.  What else can I do?--It\\'s all your own fault.  What\\'syour address?\"She gave it to him tremulously.\"All right,\" he said.  \"I\\'ll have a cab there for you to-morrow atfive-thirty.\"Her body shook with frightened sobs.\"Oh, Mr. Dyker,\" she repeated, \"please don\\'t make me do this!  I\\'d doanythin\\', \\'most, under the sun for you; but I can\\'t face MissMarian--honest to God, I can\\'t.\"What he should have done was to play upon her gratitude, but what hedid do was again to allow his mistrust and anger to have their rein.\"I won\\'t have any nonsense about this, Violet,\" he said.  \"If youdon\\'t come to my office to-morrow at six, I\\'ll have you arrested--andI\\'ll see to it that you won\\'t escape with a mere fine, either.\"\"It won\\'t----\"  She could not grasp it.  \"What do you mean?\" sheasked.\"I mean I\\'ll have you arrested on a big charge.\"Her lips stiffened with that common terror of the law, about the onlyterror that the law ever succeeds nowadays in creating: theunreasoning terror that seldom serves as a deterrent.\"I ain\\'t done nothin\\' but this,\" she said, in the full knowledge thatwhat she had or had not done would be no factor in the problem.\"You\\'ll find out about that when the time comes,\" he answered.  \"WhatI want to know is whether you\\'ll do me this favor or not.\"He had stopped and confronted her.  Even in the semi-darkness heranxious eyes managed to read his pale, determined face, but even inthe daylight they could have found there no relenting.She gave him a despairing smile.\"I guess I\\'ve got to,\" she said.\"Yes, you\\'ll have to.\"\"All right.\"\"You\\'ll do it?\"\"I\\'ll do it, all right.\"\"No bluff?\"\"No.\"\"Remember: if you don\\'t, I\\'ll fix you.\"Mary turned away.\"I\\'ll not forget,\" she said.\"If you don\\'t,\" he called after her, \"you won\\'t be sorry.\"\"I won\\'t forget,\" she repeated.And yet, even as she walked away from him, the sickness of indecisionwas upon her.  Like all narrow experiences, her narrow experiencemade her afraid of everything beyond its own limits.  Her habit oflife was the habit of the weakened bird of prey that attacks only thedefenseless and flies before the strong.  She had become a moralcoward, and the progress of her physical disease directly accentuatedthe insidious encroachments of her moral illness.  She could notopenly face Marian; she did not dare openly to defy Dyker.  Shewanted only to run away.By four o\\'clock the next afternoon she had run away.  The night hadbeen a wearisome journey backward and forward between the decision toobey the magistrate and the decision to evade him.  She thought thatshe owed him much, but she knew that she could not successfully faceMarian and lie.  She was tremblingly afraid of Wesley\\'s vengeance,but she was more afraid of Marian\\'s honest eyes.  All day she layupon her bed, dizzy from this circling process of thought, but atlast, in an attack of dread of the lie more severe than any that hadpreceded it, she flung her clothes into a little trunk, which she hadrecently purchased, and, calling a cab, drove to a new lodging-house.She did not go out that evening, but the next she had to go, and shehad not been on Broadway for two hours before a plain-clothes mantouched her arm.\"I\\'m sorry, kid,\" he said, \"but you\\'ve got to come along with me.\"Instinctively she recoiled, but the detective\\'s fingers had slippedto her wrist and tightened on it.  The sword had fallen.\"Where to?\" she asked.She knew the man.  She had given him money, and more than money, yetshe expected no mercy, expected nothing but an explanation.\"Jefferson Market,\" said her captor.  \"But if you\\'ve got anybodyhandy who\\'ll go your bail, I\\'ll take you to see him first, before wego down to Ninth Street.\"Mary shook her head.  Helpless horror had her for its own.\"No use,\" she answered.\"Are you sure?\" he asked.\"Certain sure,\" she said, and then, a little wistfully: \"I guessthere ain\\'t no good in tryin\\' to talk business to you?\"The detective was a big, black-mustached man.  His face was notunkindly, but he was helpless.\"No,\" he said; \"this here\\'s orders from the front.  If you haven\\'tgot some fellow to be ready with bail, I guess we\\'d better hurry up.\"They crossed to Sixth Avenue and walked down that noisy thoroughfareto the towering brick fortress that stands like a castle to guard thegateway of old Greenwich Village.By day that somber building seems to hide behind the grim planks ofthe elevated railroad; it is ugly, neglected, innocent; under itsprotecting wings are the stalls of white-aproned butchers and theopen establishments of green-grocers and hucksters plying theirseveral occupations.  But no sooner does the darkness drop itscurtain over the webbed streets, the dirty courts, and the foulalleys that surround the place, than Jefferson Market ceases to be abuilding for the dispensation of food and becomes a court for thedispensation of the commodity that we carelessly label Justice.  Thehands of the large clock in the high tower are hurried toward thehour of twelve; long rays of sinister light are shot from windowsnarrow and barred; and under a vaulted entrance-way there pours, fromyear\\'s end to year\\'s end, an unending army of those women of thestreet who have lost, for one reason or another, their ability anylonger to purchase the protection of the Law.It is not often that what the statutes designate as crime comes tothe Night Court: Crime may wait for the morning.  It is the drunkard,the vagrant, the licenseless pedlar, and, above all, unfriended MariaPeripatetica, the human being that humanity has spoiled in themaking, who is taken there.  Above all, the Marias Peripateticæ thathave, once fostered by the Law, quarreled with it, failed to bribeit, or openly rebelled against it.  Black and white, short-skirtedand gray-haired, besilked and bedraggled, from nine in the eveninguntil early morning, five thousand in a twelvemonth, they are broughtto the Jefferson Market Court for judgment from the power that hasmade them what they are.And judgment is what they receive.  The law is a mill that was madeto grind out one thing, and can grind no other; the courts wereconstituted to make criminals and to punish them, not to prevent orto cure; our present justice is not mercy; it is formulæ, notsentiment.  There is one woman that has some small authority in thistribunal, one woman that sees an occasional girl with some promise inher face and takes her away to Waverley House for observation and tobe given, if all goes well, a chance at other employment; butWaverley House is small, it is poor, and there is small chance forher that has been twice stricken.  One woman cannot do much againstthe grinding mill, and the grinding mill, between January andDecember, sends only seventeen girls to a semi-sane reformatory ascompared to three thousand that it sends to the university of crimewhich is known as \"The Island.\"Mary was hurried up a short flight of stone steps and into a smallhallway.  A metal gate was opened for her and snapped shut as shepassed it.  A stocky man took her name and address and got, from herconductor, in a voice that she could not hear, the charge on whichshe had been arrested, and then, after one turn to the left andanother to the right, she was shoved through a door and into abrightly-lighted, heavily-barred detention-pen.Dazedly, she looked about.  Beside her, upon one side, sat agray-haired woman of sixty, too old any longer to earn that tributewhich would have secured her immunity for the prosecution of thetrade she must recently have adopted.  Nearby was a girl of thirteen,who, temporarily neglected by her owner, had been arrested for thesame offense.  On the bench sat a fat negress who informed alllisteners that she was falsely charged with picking the pocket of abald-headed white man that she had solicited.  Over them all streamedthe pitiless light of strong lamps, upon them all were soon to feastthe eyes of the crowd in the near court-room.The newcomer bowed her head.  She did not know that a court-retainerhad been waiting her arrival.  She did not know that, as soon as shehad entered, this retainer had hurried to a telephone.  She did notknow that, in answer to this call, Rafael Angelelli had hurried tothe door that she had just passed, and there presented a note bearinga potent signature.  She did not even know that these things were ofcommon enough occurrence, and she was aware of only her misery untilshe heard the Italian\\'s low voice and saw him beckoning her to thebars.She almost ran toward him.  The other prisoners gathered about her,but the officer that accompanied Angel waved them away, and himselfdrew back.  Mary clutched the bars as if they had been a tangiblehope.\"Angel!\" she whispered.But Angelelli fronted her, scowling.  He shook a tight fist under hershrinking eyes.\"You are a dam\\' fool!\" he answered.Mary could not articulate.  Her lips involuntarily found an unthoughtquery, but her voice was dumb.\"Why you not leesten to theesa Wesley Dyk\\'?\" pursued Rafael.  \"Nowmaybe you go to the Island.  You know what that mean?  Theesa jailerscut off your hair, beat you up every mornin\\', every evenin\\' regular.No meals; only bread an\\' water; no wheeskey.  An\\' when you come outevery cop hava you\\' peecture an\\' you get arrest\\' each time an\\' sentaback again to jail!\"She believed him.  She would have believed anything that was said toher by someone she had previously known.  With a flow of ready tearsthat blinded her sunken eyes, she begged him to tell her of some wayof escape.Angel was ready with his answer.  It seemed that he still representedWesley Dyker and that Mr. Dyker was not disposed to be so hard on heras impartial justice demanded that he should be.  In the back-room ofa nearby saloon there were a lawyer and a notary in waiting.  If Marywould promise to swear to and sign before them a prepared paperdenying the accusations she had made to Marian, Angel would now, bymeans of a second note, see that the sitting magistrate did but fineher, and would hand her at once the amount of that fine.She had supposed that her arrest had been on the charge of larcenyfrom Mrs. Turner\\'s boarding-house; she had not known that she wasaccused of no more than the practice of her trade, and she couldscarcely credit news so good as this which Angel brought her.\"An\\' I won\\'t have to go to Miss Marian?\" she asked.\"No.  Meest\\' Dyk\\' want thees paper for hees girl--jus\\' to squareheemself witha hees girl--no more.  You go where you want.\"\"An\\' the judge\\'ll let me off?\"\"Right away.\"She promised, and a moment later was led into the court-room.She saw the gaping, leering crowd, which filled half of thatapartment beyond the low grating.  She saw the stolid policemenherding their charges as stockyard hands herd cattle for theslaughter.  She saw the stealthy slavers buzzing in and out, bentupon nefarious rescue; the waiting lawyers on the outer bench and thelaughing lawyers inside, joking together or making mirth before thedesk at which, in his black robe, sat the weary, cynical, indifferentmagistrate, his face as expressionless as that of a Chinese Joss.She heard, between the roars of elevated trains, the unintelligibleoaths, administered, as she now understood that the average oath isadministered, with a rapidity that robbed them of all dignity andmost effect; the drone of testimony constantly interrupted to thepoint of confusion and always curtailed to the exclusion of essentialtruth; the mechanical pronouncement of sentence that ended, as if thetwo things were on phrase, in the summoning of the succeeding case.All this she saw and heard and disregarded.  She had been struckdown, trapped, held fast in the grip of the invisible enemy that shethought of as the City.  She had been conscious of nothing but theliving Fear, and now, Angel had told her, some portion of relief wasat hand.Her arraignment, the payment of her fine, her meeting with thewaiting Italian, her progress to the nearby saloon where the lawyerand the notary were ready for her--all this passed like a vision ofthe night.  She signed without reading it--though she would not haveunderstood it if she had read it--the formal denial to which heraffirmation was immediately affixed.  She was too dazed to thinkuntil, leaving the three smiling men behind her, she had turned againinto free Sixth Avenue.It was then that she saw coming toward her a young man--a young manthat might have been anywhere from nineteen to thirty-two--with hairthat was dark and curly, sorely-shaven olive cheeks just showing thedefeated tokens of a blue-black beard; a dapper, prosperous youngman, with thick lips and hard eyes and a smartly cut overcoat, fromone pocket of which flashed a brilliant-bordered handkerchief.In the instant Mary\\'s exhaustion dropped from her brain andshoulders.  She forgot her fright of the earlier evening; sheremembered only the sufferings from which it had arisen.  Her waitinghad not, after all, been vain.  She was calm, she was resourceful,she was resolved.\"Hello, Max,\" she said.XXVIIJUDGMENTAt first he did not know her.  He stood there, while their eyes werelocked, in his own eyes no gleam of honest memory.  He wasunchanged--the serene, the secure, the smug Max Grossman of thatfirst meeting in the street of her little Pennsylvania town; but she,as she so well knew without this silent testimony, was not now, andnever again could be, the girl of that lost springtime.  He looked ather, his thick lips drawn thin in a professional grimace, and notuntil she spoke a second time did he recognize her.He started then, and his olive face went pale; but Mary put out herhand precisely as if she were meeting, after a brief absence, only anacquaintance of the everyday friendly sort, and Max, too glad forpardon to question motive, seized and squeezed her hand tenderly.\"Vhat?\" he cried in mock pleasure at this _contretemps_.  \"No, it_ain\\'d_!  I gan\\'t hardly belief mine eyes you\\'re lookin\\' so fine.But it _is_ Mary Denbigh!\"She smiled almost gayly.  In little she had to lie, but in much,though for a reason that he must not suspect, she was indeed exultant.\"I am lookin\\' good, ain\\'t I, Max?\" she said.He surveyed her cheap finery; saw her hair, disordered in her passagethrough the crowded court-room, and turned his gaze quickly from herhollow, painted cheeks, her hardening carmine mouth, and her heavilyringed eyes.\"You\\'re _grand_,\" he said.  \"I always knew you\\'d make good, Mary.\"\"You jollier!\" she laughed, and with her free hand, patted his olivecheek.\"No, it\\'s _hon_est, so help me.\"\"Then don\\'t you want to buy me a drink, Max?\"Grossman dropped her hand.  His face grew doubtful.\"I vish I had _dime_,\" he said, \"but I god to see a friend down theAvenue, an\\'----\"\"A lady, Max?\"\"Ach, no, Mary.\"\"Then let him go.  You ought to be glad to take a walk with asgood-lookin\\' a girl as you say I am.\"For another fleeting instant Max let his eyes rest on her face, thenlowered them.  He looked at the pavement and drew an awkward lineupon it with the edge of his tan boot-sole.  More significant thanany physical change in her was the fact that she could now embarrasshim.\"I know, Mary,\" he stammered; \"but, you see, this here feller vhat Itol\\'----\"She laughed again.  She thrust her arm through his and turned hisface uptown.\"Forget it!\" she said.  \"Don\\'t you worry, Max; I ain\\'t goin\\' to rakethings up, if that\\'s what\\'s souring you.  Life\\'s too short.  All Iwant is a talk and a drink.\"Half reluctantly, he let her lead him; but she could lead him andthat sufficed her.He lit an American cigarette and puffed it nervously.\"I\\'ve just been in there,\" she said, with a backward jerk of her headin the direction of the police-court.\"There?\"  Max was not surprised, but he added: \"Vhat vas you doin\\' inthere?\"\"What do you think?\" responded Mary.  She herself was thinkingrapidly--about other things.\"You vasn\\'t in drouble?\"\"I guess you would call it that.\"\"Pinched?\"\"Yes.\"He had asked her no questions about her past--but concerning herpresent he chanced a query.\"Mary,\" he inquired, \"do you mean they god you up fer your beesiness?\"\"That\\'s about it,\" she said.\"But vhy don\\'t you square you\\'self vith the goppers?\"\"I don\\'t know.  I--I was broke, Max.\"\"I vish I gould _help_ you, Mary,\" he said, his curiosity cooling atthe thought of an appeal for assistance.She saw it, and it amused her.\"Can\\'t you do it?\" she asked, dropping her voice into a whine.He tried to draw away from her, but her linked arm held himaffectionately fast.\"I been havin\\' rotten luck,\" he declared; \"somethin\\' awful.  I ain\\'tgot hardly only the money vhat\\'s in my _glothes_.\"\"Well, then,\" said Mary, looking at the clothes and knowing well thatthey somewhere concealed an ample yellow sum, \"why don\\'t you take meon your staff?\"\"Mary,\" he cried, trying to spread his hands, and failing dismallywith the one that her pinioning arm hampered, \"vhat do you think Iam?  A millionaire?  I ain\\'t got no staff.\"\"Come off!\" she bantered.\"I ain\\'t--honest.\"\"Still in the other line?\" she persisted.  \"I thought you might betrottin\\' \\'em on the street--they say there\\'s more in it.  Why do youstick to supplyin\\' the flats and the houses?\"Her voice was the perfection of good nature, but he writhed under it.\"Mary!\" he pleaded.\"Well,\" she said, disregarding his tone, and keeping his arm fast inher own, \"you do supply \\'em, don\\'t you?  I know one fellow who makeshis livin\\' goin\\' the rounds, findin\\' what girls is sore on theirmadams an\\' then gettin\\' a commission by sneakin\\' \\'em out an\\' changin\\'\\'em to new flats.  He lets on he\\'s sellin\\' kimonas, but one sample\\'slasted him three years.\"\"Mary!\" repeated Max, more weakly.\"That\\'s the truth,\" she said, and then: \"But can\\'t you startstreet-work an\\' take me on your staff?\"Again he looked at her,\"No,\" he answered.\"Not young enough lookin\\' now, eh?\"  She was still smiling.\"Ach,\" he protested, \"you oughtn\\'t nod to be so _hard_ on a feller.If you chust knowed----\"But she had gone far enough, and she would not let him finish.  Theyhad reached a saloon near to her new lodging-place, and she paused.There was, and she knew it, no word in his excuse that she would havecredited.  Nor did she mean, just yet, to let him see her hatred.  Inorder that he might the better see it at a later moment, she wantednow to quiet his naturally ready fears.  She had found that she couldharass him, and that, for the present, was all that she needed toknow.\"Never mind,\" she said, \"I told you I wasn\\'t goin\\' to rake upnothin\\', an\\' I mean to keep my word.  Come on in here.  This is aquiet place.  You\\'re goin\\' to buy me a drink, anyhow, just to showthat we\\'re still friends.\"He brightened at this indicated avenue of escape.\"_Sure_ we\\'re still friends,\" he declared, \"an\\' you can haf all youvant to _drink_, too.\"She slipped her hand into his--she could do it, she had learned,without the dumb flesh seeming to shrink from that contact--andpressed it.They went into the deserted \"ladies\\' room\" of the saloon to which shehad referred, and sat down there, facing each other under a lightturned kindly low.\"Vhiskey?\" asked Max.\"Yes,\" said Mary.\"Two of \\'em,\" ordered Max of the waiter that had answered his ring,\"an\\' don\\'d make \\'em so _stingy_ like most you fellers ofer this vay.\"The man brought the liquor, placed it before them, and went away.\"Vell,\" said Max, raising his glass, smiling his thin smile, andapparently forgetting that he had ever denied whiskey; \"here ve are,_ain\\'t_ it?\"If Mary was remembering another night and another drink she did notsay so; instead, as Max tilted his sleek head far back between hisshoulders and dropped the whiskey down his throat, her hand watchedfor the instant when his gray eyes were on the ceiling and thatinstant poured the liquor from her own glass to the floor.  When hercompanion\\'s head came forward her fingers, wrapped about the glass,were just withdrawing it from her lips.\"I can drink that better\\'n I used to,\" she said.Max grinned again.  So long as she did not upbraid him for his partin it, so long as she did not go into the details of its earlierstages, he had no objection to hearing of her past, was evenlanguidly curious about it, and was certainly sorry that it had notbrought her to more seeming prosperity.\"You sure didn\\'t take that like you vasn\\'t _used_ vith it,\" he said.\"I\\'ll take another just to show you how,\" she answered, and pressedthe nearest button.This time his eyes were on her and she had to drink.  But she did notscruple: so long as she retained her head and Max lost his, theeffect of the alcohol on her system concerned her but little.They had a third drink, for \"old time\\'s sake,\" as Mary suggested, andthis she succeeded in pouring down her dress-front.  At the fourth,Max began to show signs of fear that he would have a drunken woman onhis hands, but Mary\\'s patent sobriety soon reassured him, andovercame his protests against a fifth by recalling his promise ofliberality.His cold eyes sparkled into a faint light.  Little spots of redappeared in the olive of his cheeks.  He felt the advance of theenemy in his veins and tried to go; but Mary began an imaginativenarrative of her recent experiences and insisted on his listening.When he at last successfully interrupted that, she twitted him withbeing able to drink less than his pupils, and Max was once moreforced to order.  He was not drunk, or nearly drunk, but the fineedge of his discretion was dulled: he saw in the woman, who had nowmoved to his side, nothing that, whatever motives might be at work,could possibly harm him; he found something ludicrous in thesituation.  Her looks seemed better than they had appeared an hourearlier, and her tentative advances flattered him.Mary, though she had drunk more than was good for her, had managed tospill enough liquor to retain all the sobriety she needed; but, whenthey at last rose, she swayed a little unsteadily.\"Now,\" she said, \"you\\'ll just buy me a half-pint for my head in themornin\\', an\\' then you\\'ll walk as far as my door.\"Still enjoying the piquancy of the affair, he obeyed her.  He evenconsented to come to her hall-bedroom with her--a room the exactreproduction of that which she had formerly rented fartheruptown--and there, forgetful of the provision against the morning,they finished the half-pint.At last he stood up from the bed on which he had been sitting whileshe, opposite, used the single chair.\"Vell,\" he said, grinning; \"it\\'s been good to see you again, undmaybe I\\'ll gome back some efenin\\'.\"She rose before him.  The light was at her back and her face resumed,as she stood there, some furtive traces of its earlier grace.  Theeyes seemed to soften, the cheeks were a natural pink beneath theircoating of rouge, and her russet hair, curling about her face,relieved the harder outlines and cast a gentle shadow around theneck.  She spread out her arms.\"Kiss me,\" she said.He smiled and leaned condescendingly toward her.\"What\\'s your hurry?\" she murmured.He looked at her, and the weak light and the strong liquor stood herin good stead.\"I ain\\'t in no hurry,\" he smiled.She met him smile for smile--and then, in a sudden sense of triumph,she flung back her head and laughed.It was not until three hours later that he finally left her, but heleft hurriedly, for the remorseless gray light of morning was comingin at the window, and it fell upon her as she wrapped a soiled pinkkimona around her shivering figure and slipped her feet into a pairof rundown Turkish slippers.\"Good-by,\" he said, looking away from her.\"Wait a minute,\" said Mary.  \"I\\'ll go with you to the door.\"She did go.  She followed him down the dark stairway, creakingnoisily under their shamed feet, and she stood for a moment in theblack hall, holding the brass knob of the door, as he passed to thestep outside.  Mary slipped the dead-latch, ready to bolt the door.\"Max,\" she said.He turned quickly, nearly knocking over, as he did so, themilk-bottles that were lined, in a white row, upon the step.\"Yes?\" he returned, and grinned sheepishly.She thrust out her towsled head and looked up and down the graymorning street.  The block was empty.  She drew her head clear of thedoor.  She was still trembling, but from neither cold nor fear.\"You ain\\'t goin\\' without kissin\\' me?\" she asked.But a reaction of disgust had seized him.\"Yes, I am,\" he said.Mary\\'s one hand tightened on the knob; the other flattened itselfagainst the nearest panel of the door, ready to push hard.\"All right,\" she replied, with a sudden change in her voice that,still low, became tense and metallic.  \"You think I\\'m--I\\'m done for,Max.  Well--_you\\'re done for, too!_\"The man\\'s jaw dropped.  His olive face was ashen.  His eyes stared.\"What do you mean?\" he asked.Mary\\'s mouth was wreathed in a smile.\"You know,\" she answered.Max retreated so suddenly that he nearly fell down the stone steps.\"You\\'ve--you\\'ve----\" he gasped.\"Yes,\" said Mary.\"It\\'s a lie!  You\\'re tryin\\' to scare me!\"  His jaw workedspasmodically.  \"It\\'s a damned lie!\" he repeated.\"You don\\'t believe me?\" the girl inquired.If she had looked for heroics, if she had feared melodrama, she wasas yet disappointed.  The knees of Max shook under him; he was inabject terror.\"It\\'s a lie,\" he muttered over and over.  \"It\\'s a damn\\' lie!\"\"Think what you please,\" said Mary.  She was still smiling, stillserene.  \"You believed I\\'d forgot, didn\\'t you?  Well, I didn\\'tforget, Max Grossman, an\\' now you\\'ll remember.  If you don\\'t yetthink I\\'m givin\\' you a straight story, all you have to do is just onething: _wait_.\"Max uttered an inarticulate cry and threw himself at her, but he onlybashed his head against the closed door.Mary had shut it, and in time.  Behind it, in the dark hallway, shelay half fainting.\"It\\'s the last of you, Max,\" she laughed.And it was.XXVIIIHUSKS OF THE SWINEMary was too ill to go to work that night, and on the night followingshe was no better.  The shock, the spasm of success, the recoil, notmoral but physical, after the satisfaction of a supreme desire--thesethings were, of themselves, enough to leave her prostrate.  But, inaddition to these, she had, while standing at that open door,contracted one of those heavy colds to which she was now renderedespecially susceptible.  Through long hours of the day and thedarkness she tossed among the hot sheets of her bed, sometimes withher teeth clicking in a chill, again with her body burning in afever, but always revolving in her seething brain the details of thevengeance that she had wrought.Her physical sufferings mattered little to her.  There were hourswhen she was wholly incapable of feeling them.  When the inertia ofthe state of reaction began at last to wear away, it left her with aglow of recollection so great that there seemed no place for lessersensation.  She had accomplished her great work, she had achieved hermission.  What she had done had been done solely for her own heart\\'ssake; there had been no delusion of a celestial command, no distortedthought of a social duty; yet, the impulse, however utilitarian, hadbeen supreme, and its end filled her with a sense of triumph that,for want of the proper title, she was sure was happiness.A wiser head and an unwounded heart would have known enough of lifeto see that even Max Grossman was not entirely to blame.  A betterbrain could have looked back into the past.  It could have seen Maxas the type of all his kind, the symbol of every one of the greatcompany of slavers, the inevitable result of a system blind both toits own interests and to the interests of the race.  It could haveseen the child, one of half a dozen born to a woman that could not,properly, have cared for three.  It could have seen that childneglected, dirty, forgotten, locked, by day, in the bedroom where thewhole family tried vainly to sleep by night, learning the highestfacts of life from the worst of teachers: the cramped childishbrain--and going out, at last, upon the street, with passionsprematurely developed and perverted.  It could have seen the socialorder shape that child into society\\'s enemy: the starvedboy-pickpocket sent to the monstrously misnamed \"reformatory\"; thesame child branded as a criminal, with none to shelter or to trusthim, and with a knowledge, gained in the state\\'s own institution,which fitted him to be only a crafty gorilla to harass the state.  Itcould have seen the fatal line of least resistance as clearly in theresultant man as it is seen in the life of him that does no more thanwreck a bank or steal a corporation, and, hideous as its course is inthe one instance, it would have seen that the line was the same inall.But Mary never doubted her justice, and never regretted it.  One onlythought troubled her: she was afraid that, by telling Max, she mighthave given him a warning sufficiently early to defeat her ownultimate purpose.  It was a large part of her plan that he shouldknow whose hand had struck him, and, for a man in his business, theonly way in which she could make that knowledge certain was the waythat she had followed.  Yet what if he were in time to profit by herinformation?  What if, even were he too late, he should guard anddoctor himself with proper caution?  She turned the questions overand over in her mind, but she had always to end in the faith that theworst had happened.Sometimes, in the moments of exhaustion from the mad round of theseinquiries, she reverted for relief to matters that touched her lessnearly, and endeavored to occupy herself with the affairs of others.She thought of Dyker, and without resentment.  She knew that he woulduse her written retraction to regain Marian\\'s confidence, and shehoped that he would be successful.  Again she fell to speculatingupon the fate of Carrie Berkowicz and to wondering what had become ofKatie.  But upon her own past and present she did not permit herselfto dwell, and always, with the certainty of a machine, her brainrecurred to Max and her vengeance on him.On the third evening, however, her landlady, entering with supper,reminded her, without mincing matters, that the rent was due, andMary recalled that her little stock of money was exhausted.\"Can you wait till to-morrow morning, Mrs. Foote?\" she asked.Mrs. Foote was an ample woman, with round cheeks and robust frame,whose only dissipations were an over-indulgence in ritualism, babies,and the hospital.  She had a high-church cleric to whom she confessedthe sins of her neighbors; a wraithlike husband whose sole occupationappeared to be that indispensable to the regular increase of herfamily--and whom she would otherwise have failed altogether totolerate--and such a passion for being ill that she could never quitebelieve in the illnesses of others.\"I can wait just that long, Miss Morton,\" she said; \"but I\\'msufferin\\' so from rheumatism in my fingers that I just know my oldgastric trouble is comin\\' on ag\\'in, an\\' that\\'ll mean another of themhospital-bills.\"Mary raised her aching head.\"You won\\'t have to wait any longer,\" she answered.\"I\\'m glad of it, Miss Morton,\" responded Mrs. Foote, \"for there was ayoung lady lookin\\' at this room to-day an\\' she offered me a dollarmore a week for it, an\\' I wouldn\\'t like to lose you.\"\"You won\\'t lose me,\" said Mary, to whom even sustained conversationwas physical pain.  \"I\\'m goin\\' out to-night, an\\' I\\'ll have plenty foryou by the mornin\\'.\"\"You\\'re sure?\" asked the landlady.\"Of course I am.  It\\'d be a pity if I couldn\\'t earn that much.\"Mrs. Foote looked at Mary\\'s face and seemed to doubt the foundationfor her assurance.\"Well,\" she sighed, \"I certainly hope you can.\"For some minutes after the door closed, Mary lay still.  She hadagain been brought face to face with the most poignant of tragedies,the tragedy of living.An hour earlier, had she questioned herself, she would have said thatshe was careless of life, that neither this earth nor the quitting ofit interested her, that continued existence was a matter ofindifference.  Then she was in that state of exultation above thingsmundane which is produced only by great sorrow, great joy, or thegreat revenges that are both grief and triumph.  But now the words ofthe landlady had brought her back from the indulgence ofcontemplation to the necessity of action.  Mary\\'s insidious,implacable disease had completed what her business had begun, andwhat her business alone would have completed far more slowly.  Thefew emotions that she was now capable of feeling were the moreintense because of their rarity, but their intensity was equaled bytheir brevity and, when the moment had gone, it left her even more ofa moral weakling than it had found her.She knew Mrs. Foote and her tribe too well to deceive herself as towhat must happen should the morning dawn upon an empty stocking.Life held nothing for which Mary greatly cared, but the instant ofdeath contained all of which she was afraid.  She did not greatlywant to harm others by plying her trade in her present condition, butshe could not think of others.  Each step would be a separate woundto her tortured body and her throbbing head, but she understood thatthe landlady had to wring out the rents by the means that conditionshad forced upon her; and so the worst of fears, the fear of poverty,which is the fear of death, took this sick woman from her bed,dressed her in her best frock, and sent her out into the street.Along Sixth Avenue, where fortune had often, theretofore, been kindto her, she met no significant glances.  A passing girl or two,having missed her for the last few evenings, proffered a casualsympathy; but that was all.  Through the open doors of the Haymarket,she turned in, but there even the women at first disregarded her.Several men that she recognized in the boxes of the gallery aroundthe little hall nodded, but immediately looked away.  The one manthat she happened to know better than any of the others did notappear at all to remember her, and his neighbor, who had frequentlyaccompanied her, signaled elsewhere.She was lonely.  She approached two women who were circling thefloor, arm in arm.  She addressed them with the familiarity of thecraft.\"Hello,\" she said.The one woman smiled, but her companion, a formidable, tailor-madepersonage, swelled with dignity.\"You better beat it,\" she declared.Mary flushed.\"What\\'s eatin\\' you?\" she demanded.\"You don\\'t belong here,\" the woman answered.  She made a lofty surveyof Mary\\'s finery, and then added: \"Goin\\'?\"Mary\\'s heart sickened, but she stood her ground.\"No,\" she said, \"I ain\\'t.\"The floor-manager was passing.  The social arbiter turned to him.\"Will,\" she asked, and her shrill voice seemed to carry over all theroom; \"what\\'s this place comin\\' to?  Throw that Fourteenth Streetwoman out o\\' here!\"This was enough.  Mary left the place, and, still aching in everylimb, turned through a narrow cross-street to Broadway.  Her eyesswam as she lingered before shop-windows in the hope that someone shepassed would accost her.  Her throat was dry and it hurt her when shehummed into the ears of careless pedestrians.  Nobody seemed to heedher.  The night was cold, and she shook like a recovering drunkard.She mastered all her strength to speak plainly to a complacent man ina great ulster.\"Hello!\" she said, trying to smile.  \"What\\'s your hurry?\"The man looked at her and swore.\"You must think I\\'m blind,\" he ended.She knew that she looked ill, but she knew that she must find money.She pleaded with age, because she knew it to be æstheticallytolerant; she ogled youth, because she knew it to be inexperienced;and she stationed herself at last near a saloon in a poorly lightedquarter, because she concluded that the men leaving such places werethe only men to whom she was just then fitted successfully to appeal.It was one o\\'clock in the morning before she could induce even one ofthese to give way to her, and he, staggering with drink so that shehad to support him with all her ebbing powers, insisted on stoppingin an alleyway when, for the first time, she picked a pocket.  Adollar and a half was all that she had as she left him, and the nextdark figure that she stopped--she did not look at his face or carewhat sort of face it was--answered her with sharp laughter.\"A two-spot?\" he cackled.  \"You have a few more thinks comin\\', oldgirl!\"\"A dollar?\" suggested Mary, tremulously.\"I got just a half--an\\' you ain\\'t worth a cent more.\"She took it--what would she not have taken?--and she worked on intothe dawn, on with a mounting fever and a sick determination, knowingnow that her chances grew with the approach of morning and findingherself, when at last the morning came, with scarcely a dollar beyondthe sum due for rent.During all the months that followed she skirted the dire edge ofstarvation, more than half the time too ill to rise from her bed andaware that she was at no moment fit to rise.  As her cold grewsteadily better her deeper illness steadily increased.  It thrived onevery exertion and seemed to gain each atom of strength that shelost.  Things might thus continue for almost any period, but she knewthat her manner of life forbade absolute cure, and that, at the end,there waited a slow and loathsome death.  Anticipation made herfaint; the melancholia and terror, which are symptomatic, sometimesnearly maddened her.  The last vestiges of the moral sense, so earlyinjured by previous experience, were almost wholly destroyed; therewas no social consciousness; the appeal of the individual wideneduntil it occupied her entire horizon; there was room for nothing butthe craven passion for life.Fat Dr. Helwig, when she went to see him, blinked at her out of hisdeep-set eyes, and told her that she was not taking sufficient rest.Mary twisted her helpless hands.\"How can I afford to take it?\" she asked.\"Save your money,\" said he, patting her thin shoulders, and chucklingprosperously.  \"You girls never put aside a cent.\"\"We don\\'t earn enough.\"\"Poof!  That\\'s what you all say.  I know--I know.  We men aren\\'t suchfools as you take us for.\"But Mary, as each evening she made up before her little mirror, notedthe gradual depreciation of her wares; each week she found it harderto pay rent and retain enough money for food.  Mrs. Foote seemed tocome every day, instead of every seventh, and yet each night businessgrew more difficult.  Whenever Mary missed a few evenings, orwhenever she changed her hunting-grounds, the police needed freshpayments.  She surrendered one uptown cross-street after another.  Atlast she deserted Broadway and patrolled only that Fourteenth Streetwhich the woman at the Haymarket had so scornfully referred to andwhich had so wonderfully burst upon Mary\\'s sight when she firststepped from the Hudson Tunnel upon the surface of Manhattan.Spring, summer, and autumn passed, and a lean winter followed them.Mary caught another cold and was ill for a week.  She went to worktoo soon and had to go back to bed for several days and remain idlefor several nights.  At last, with the ancient fear of the whiterace--the fear of that poverty which is death--gnawing at her vitals,she struggled to her feet and tramped once more along FourteenthStreet from Sixth Avenue to Third.But now the sword descended.  Even the Fourteenth Street saloon bestknown for her purposes gave no fish to her net, and Eighth Street waslittle better.  She was too tired to go farther; she had, the nextmorning, to offer Mrs. Foote only a third of what was due.The landlady, whose bulk seemed to crowd the hall-bedroom, leanedheavily against its frail door.  Mary thought the woman\\'s slow, browneyes more than commonly suspicious and her round face implacablyhard.  The tenant, with all explanation frozen upon her lips, handedover the clinking bits of money.  They fell into the big, extendedpalm as a few drops of water might fall into a basin.  Mrs. Footebegan slowly to count the coins.Mary watched, in fascinated silence, the counting of those few piecesof silver, each one of which seemed stained with her blood.  She sawthe landlady\\'s expression change to one of incredulity.  She saw thecounting repeated.Mrs. Foote again thrust out her grimy fingers.\"What\\'s this?\" she demanded.\"It\\'s----\"  Mary looked at the floor.  \"It\\'s the rent,\" sheconcluded, in a whisper.\"_What\\'s_ the rent?\"\"That\\'s all I have--just now.  I thought--I thought, considerin\\' howlong I\\'ve been here, you might wait a day for the rest, Mrs. Foote.\"The landlady opened her hand, and Mary\\'s little store of coin droppedto the bed.\"I can\\'t take this,\" she said.\"You mean,\" asked Mary, with a quick gasp of hope, \"that you\\'ll letme keep it till I get the rest?\"\"No, I don\\'t mean nothin\\' of the sort,\" said Mrs. Foote.  \"I meanI\\'ve got to have the whole bill--right now.\"Mary\\'s heart sank.\"That\\'s all I have,\" she said.She had sunk to a seat on the tumbled bed, beside her scatteredcoins.  Her thin hands were locked across her knees; the dirty pinkkimona slipped lower from her shoulders at every frequent cough, andher eyes sought those of Mrs. Foote in dumb appeal.  Her russet hairfell dully disordered about her hollow cheeks, and the rouge on herlips was purple.\"I\\'m sorry,\" pursued Mrs. Foote, who was too used to such incidentsgreatly to concern herself; \"but I\\'ve got to make my living likeanybody else does.\"\"I was expectin\\' some money this evenin\\',\" said Mary.\"Hump!\" sniffed the landlady.\"You don\\'t believe that?\"\"I don\\'t care, Miss Morton; I can\\'t care.\"\"But I\"--Mary\\'s fingers knotted tighter about her knees--\"I waspromised it,\" she lied, \"an\\' I\\'m dead sure to get it then.\"\"I\\'ve heard that so many times,\" said Mrs. Foote, \"that I knowed itby heart three year\\' ago.\"\"I could pawn somethin\\',\" suggested Mary.The landlady swept the bare room with a critical glance.\"What?\" she asked.There was no adequate answer to be made.  Mary had tried to pledgeher coat a few days before, and had been offered only an inadequatetwenty-five cents for it.\"Then you won\\'t--you can\\'t wait?\"\"No, I can\\'t.  I\\'m a sick woman myself; my rent\\'s due, Miss Mary, an\\'the honest truth is that there\\'s such a lot of women wantin\\' roomsthat I\\'d only be doin\\' a injustice to my children not to take in alady that could pay prompt--for a while.\"Mary said nothing more.  She packed her few belongings into hertrunk, left it in the hall to be called for, and, as the chillevening fell, went away from the house with no idea where she was tofind a lodging for the night.  For an hour, though she was stillweak, and the time was as yet so early, she walked up Broadway and,in the Forties, turned eastward for a few blocks, and so south again.Not far from the Grand Central Station she saw a little crowdgathered at a corner, and she stopped, rather for the luxury ofstanding still than from any curiosity.The place was a church.  Colored lights streamed from its richstained-glass windows.  Through its swinging doors there stole thescent of flowers and the sound of delicate music.  A long row ofcarriages, the coachmen walking up and down to keep warm, stretchedfar around the corner.Mary, shivering, worked her way quietly through the group of men andwomen on the sidewalk.  In order to avoid a particularly entangledportion of the press, she started to walk along the steps by thetower-entrance, and then, seeing a side-door open, she listlesslyturned toward it and looked in.Far away up the vaulted nave the altar stood, white with damask andyellow with candles.  The chancel was a garden, the whole buildingheavy with scent.  Acolytes in scarlet were grouped about the robedpriests.  The choir had risen and, preceded by a lad that bore alofta great brass cross, were forming into a singing procession, whichslowly filed down the center aisle.With a subdued scuffle and swish, the congregation also rose as thedouble line of choristers moved between them.  Women craned theirnecks and men, pretending to look stolidly ahead of them, lookedreally out of the corners of their eyes.  The choir, at the maindoor, divided and stood still.  High overhead a deep-toned organ wasplaying the wedding-march from Lohengrin, and through the respectfulline of white-clad boys there moved a man of regular features withlowered lids that hid his eyes, and a crisp brown mustache, whichconcealed his lips, and, on his arm, in the costume of a bride, atall, graceful, pure woman, whose face was like a Greek cameo and inwhose hand was a huge bunch of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley.The fingers of a policeman touched Mary\\'s arm.\"You\\'ll have to get back,\" he said.  \"The people\\'ll be comin\\' out ina minute.\"But Mary did not wish to move.\"I\\'ve got a right here,\" she answered.\"You?\" The policeman looked at her, and then laughed.  \"What right?\"he asked.\"Isn\\'t that Miss Lennox?\"\"It was.\"\"And Judge Dyker?\"\"Sure.\"\"Well, I gave him his marriage-license.\"The policeman\\'s good-nature was amused, but he forced her back to thestreet.\"No use,\" he said.\"An\\' I guess,\" said Mary bitterly--\"I guess I paid for the bride\\'sbouquet.\"He did not reply, nor would she have heard him had he spoken, for inthe stream of lesser guests now flowing from the rear of the church,which had been assigned to them, she was met by Katie Flanagan.Not the piquant Katie of that photograph which used to adorn thebureau in the shabby tenement of bachelor Hermann Hoffmann, or thesaucy girl of the second-hand clothing-store, or yet the frightenedclerk that had at first evaded and at last defied the whiskered Mr.Porter.  Those days were patently passed; Katie, like many anotherstrong soul, had faced temptation and conquered it; and in the steadof the old days had come new days that brought a maturity and adignity with which Katie was consciously satisfied.  Her blue eyeswere as glad as Mary remembered them, but their happiness was calm;her black hair was gathered in a formal knot, and her gown, though abetter gown than that she used to wear, was of a simplicity almostsevere.Nevertheless, when she saw Mary, who sought evasion, Katie camefrankly forward with outstretched hand.  She recognized with regret,the change in her former acquaintance, but, knowing, as she must haveknown, its cause, she decided to ask no questions concerning it, and,if she offered no assistance, she at least proffered no advice.\"I just come to see the last o\\' Miss Marian,\" she explained.  \"Nearthe half of old Rivington Street\\'s been tucked in here among th\\'swells to give the good word to her--Jews an\\' Irish--an\\' if therabbis won\\'t mind for the sheenies to come to such a heathen church,I thought Father Kelly might manage to forgive me.\"Mary\\'s brain was just then too dull to make any but a commonplaceanswer.\"You\\'re lookin\\' well,\" she said.\"I ought to be, though there\\'s a youngster expected.  I tellHermann--we was married a few weeks after last election--I don\\'t knowhow we\\'ll keep a family; but he just whistles an\\' says we\\'ll make outsome way, an\\' I guess we will.\"\"I\\'m glad,\" said Mary, \"that you\\'re married.\"\"Well, so am I--most of the time.  Of course, the man has some queerideas, but I\\'m doin\\' me best, with Father Kelly\\'s help, to get \\'emout of the head of him, an\\' nowadays, when he goes to one of themSocialist meetin\\'s by night, I make him make up by goin\\' with me toearly mass next mornin\\'.\"She paused and surveyed again the pale woman before her.  EssentiallyKatie had not changed.  She had still, and would always have, thebig, kind heart and the ready hand of her earlier days.  But hercondition had altered, and Mary\\'s had evidently again fallen; shelooked through an alien atmosphere, and her gaze was distant: theresponsibilities and adjustment of young married life shackled her,and must continue to shackle her until they were no longer new.  Shedid not know how to suggest any assistance, did not even believe thatit was desired; but, though she still felt that she must refrain fromintimate inquiry, one effort she tried to make.\"An\\' you,\" she asked--\"how\\'re you gettin\\' on, Mary?\"Mary bit her lip.\"Fine,\" she answered, huskily.\"Are you----?  There ain\\'t----?\"  Katie floundered in a maze that shewould, a few months previously or a few months in the future, havecut her way through with a strong directness.  \"There ain\\'t nothin\\' Icould----?\"Mary\\'s head shook, almost mechanically.  It was not entirely that shefelt unable to accept assistance from her former protector; it wasrather that she felt only that she must run away.\"Oh, no,\" she said, forcing a smile.  \"I\\'m doin\\' grand.\"The gala crowd was sweeping about them.  It jostled both girls andthreatened momentarily to separate them.  After all, there wasnothing more to be said.\"I--I got to go,\" murmured Mary.  \"I got an appointment----\"\"But you\\'ll come to see us sometime, won\\'t you Mary?\" asked Katie,and she gave her address.  \"We\\'ll have a fine party at thechristening an\\' I\\'ll want you to see the baby.\"\"Oh, yes,\" said Mary; \"yes, of course.\"But Katie was hesitant.\"You\\'re sure I can\\'t do nothin\\'?\" she asked.\"No, no.  I----\"  Mary caught and pressed with what warmth there wasleft in her fingers, the Irish girl\\'s hand.  \"Good-by,\" sheconcluded, and then, in order to keep up the farce of an appointment,she got upon a passing car.Even if panic had not possessed her, she could not have acceptedanything that Katie might offer.  The most that could have been givenher would have been but temporary, and what she must have was a meansof earning a living.She rode well downtown, and then walked farther southward.  Sheslipped along the broad, yellow-lighted Bowery, gathering one or twoquarters on her way, and wandered into the narrow, serpentine,fevered alleys of Chinatown.  When an ugly rain began to fall, theopen door of a mission attracted her, and she went in to rest.It was the typical mission-room, very different from the uptownchurch where she had seen the wedding.  This new place was mean; ithad a low ceiling and was none too clean.  The lights were flaringand the dull walls were enlivened by boldly lettered Bible texts.The air was close; on the platform, at the front of the place, awell-fed man was pleading, in sweat and tears, the cause of hisreligion; nearby, his double was making ready the reed-organ.Crowded into the unsteady benches were pimpled boys with lollingmouths and preternaturally knowing eyes; youths already old indisease and drink and crime; full-grown men, frog-eyed or blear-eyed,who needed only the faculty of firmness and the chance to cultivateit; old men, who had lost their hold upon work in a country still toobarbarous to pension its aged; and, though there were no young girls,here and there Mary saw a few women, bedraggled, sodden, hideous,because men had at some time thought them _chic_, dainty, beautiful.One of the \"workers\" attached to the place--a bland, prosperous man,with a pleasant smile--approached Mary and shook her hand as if hewere an old acquaintance.  He had fat red cheeks, firm teeth, andkindly eyes.\"I\\'m glad to see you, sister,\" he said.  \"Are you saved?\"Mary\\'s childhood had heard some of the phraseology of evangelicalism.She understood, but she had come to receive worldly, not spiritual,warmth.\"No,\" she said, \"I ain\\'t.\"The \"worker,\" however, was accustomed to that reply.  He patted hershoulder.\"Don\\'t you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ?\" he asked.\"Well,\" said Mary, \"I never thought much about Him.\"She looked at the floor.  She was cold and hungry and afraid.\"Then,\" responded the man, with genuine earnestness, \"you ought tobegin to think.  No man knoweth the hour of His comin\\'.  He is readywith the Free Gift.  Don\\'t you want to come to Him?\"Mary\\'s life had been one in which there had been small time for thecultivation of religious emotion, and no time at all for thecultivation of religious thought.  At her home she had learned asmuch by rote as she had had to learn, but what she got she held onlyas so many tasks performed.  The words were lessons to be mastered;if they had any relation to facts, those facts were things not to befaced until an age of discretion, and, pending the arrival of thatage, the lessons had been stored away with a bland, childishpracticality.  What followed later had driven out all that precededit.  The shock of her capture; the wild, new order of existence; theendeavor to escape; the battle of service among new conditions; and,at last, the dulling of all the finer sensibilities and the finalfight for a mere chance to continue alive--these were circumstancesneither propitious to theology nor favorable to faith.She glanced at the mission-worker, and then glanced away.\"I dunno,\" she said.  \"I guess I ain\\'t the kind of woman religion cando much for.\"\"Don\\'t say that,\" protested the man.  His eyes shone with zeal andhis voice was tender.  \"His grace is free for all who come.  Hismercy is from everlastin\\' to everlastin\\'.  I\\'ve been a sinnermyself\"--the speaker\\'s voice swelled with a real pride--\"a terriblesinner, an\\' I know what I say, praise the Lord.  The meaner an\\' vilerwe are, the more Jesus needs us.  Just open your heart.  Just acceptHim, an\\' you\\'ll never know no more trouble in this world nor thenext.\"\"Would I get a job?\" asked Mary.The man shook his head, sadly.\"That ain\\'t no way to think about salvation,\" he declared.  \"What\\'sfreely given ought to be freely received.  Now is the appointed time.\"\"But I gotta make a livin\\'.\"\"I know it, I know it.  We\\'ve all got to do that, but ain\\'t it betterto make one an\\' be saved than to make one an\\' be sent to hell-fire?\"She assented.  \"Only,\" she added, \"I don\\'t want to starve, even if Iam saved.\"It was his old difficulty.\"I know,\" he repeated; \"an\\' we\\'d only be too glad to get you work ifwe could, but times are hard an\\' we\\'ve got a waitin\\'-list of fifty atthis very minute.  Here\\'s some meal-tickets, sister, fer we want todo what we can, an\\' we know it\\'s hard to save souls on emptystomachs.  You just think it over an\\' see if I\\'m not right aboutreligion.\"She took the tickets and used them at a five-cent eating-house duringthe next day.  That night she managed to secure a bed in a room overa saloon--a narrow, stuffy room that she shared with three otherwomen of her own sort; but the next night she earned nothing, and shehad been compelled to pawn her coat for food.  She sought a bench inUnion Square, where two tattered men made room for her.  They gaveher, to wrap about her chest, newspapers that they had gathered fromthe gutter; and she dozed until the sharp command of a policemanscattered her comrades, when they made their way to the rear of theFlatiron Building and stood, for warmth, over a grill that sent upoccasional blasts of heat from the basement.The rapidity with which one may descend from bad to worse is to bebelieved only by those who have been penniless and friendless in thelarger cities.  During the nights that followed, when Mary\\'s clothesgrew speedily ragged, dirty, and odorous, and when she earned justenough money to postpone starvation, she became a familiar ofChinatown, learned something of its blind paths and the tangledpassages of its fetid tenements.  The almond-eyed Orientalstolerantly received her.  She came to know the heavy odors of theopium, to chat with clay-white American girls, morphine-eaters, andcocaine and chloral victims, whose Chinese lovers were kind to them,and who never wanted to breathe the open air.  She was borne with,but the market was over-supplied there, and she found no regularkeeper.  She came to envy the drug-enslaved women who had firstsought the Mott Street district as missionaries, even the littleMongolian girls over whose slavery, so much lighter than her own, thecity, from time to time, grew ludicrously excited.  Her illnessprogressed, but, thanks to her hardy birth and the exercise of whatcare was at all possible, it progressed with a step so tardy as togive no indication of reaching its tragic end, other things beingequal, for two years or more.  She did not again go to see thedoctor; she did not have to.  The only things that he could haveadvised were the things that she was in no position to do.  Beyond acertain limited amount of routine care, she was helpless.One night, wet and exhausted, she met a sailor in Chatham Square, anddrank long with him.\"Where you goin\\' to sleep to-night?\" he asked, as they were about topart.He was a short, black-browed man, who walked with a bow-legged roll.The short sleeves of his jacket displayed sinewy, bronze wrists withanchors tattooed upon them.  His neck rose out of his low-cutmariner\\'s shirt like the neck of a brown, fighting bull, and hisblack eyes, set deep under bushy, frowning brows, were red, likethose of a bull that is dangerous.  He had been taken with a drunkenpassion for her, and though, when he kissed her, his upper lipscraped her face like a file, though his incessant grip of her handshurt her, and though his heavy foot, seeking hers beneath thesaloon-table, nearly crushed her own, she had to answer him with theprofessional smile.\"I dunno where I\\'ll sleep,\" she said.  \"I guess Lee Hung\\'s Letty\\'llput me up.\"The sailor chucked her pointed chin so roughly that she thought herneck would crack.\"Why don\\'t you come along o\\' me?\" he inquired.\"Where\\'s that?\"\"To one o\\' our places.  I know a beauty, an\\' I\\'ll take good care o\\'you, an\\' afterward you can stay on.\"\"One of your places?  What\\'s those?\"\"Places we visit.  Places for seafarin\\' men.  I tells you I knows adaisy--Big Lou\\'s keepin\\' it--an\\' they needs a new gal there, for Istopped in as I come ashore this evenin\\' an\\' they tole me the one Iknew after last voyage was buried only yesterday.\"Mary shuddered.\"Is it all right?\" she asked.\"All right?  Course it\\'s all right.  But mind you,\"--his black eyesleaped into a sudden threat--\"I\\'m takin\\' you to-night.  Nophilanderin\\'.  For this night y\\'er my gal.\"She looked away.\"Mind you that,\" he drunkenly repeated.  \"I\\'m mostly as gentle asNathan\\'s lamb, but when I\\'m tricked I\\'m ready with my hands.  It\\'sall right.  It\\'s a good place for a good time.  Plenty to drink an\\'the best o\\' company.  Better come.  I can fix it so\\'s you can get asteady job there.\"She shivered again, but she could not see why she should shiver.After all, she was glad to learn of any place where she would be sureof food to eat and a roof to cover her--and so she came toSummerton\\'s.XXIXTHE DOORS OF THE SHADOWIt is a winding and tortuous way across Greenwich Village toSummerton\\'s.  The mazed course runs through streets that squirm likeworms between a fisherman\\'s fingers; it skirts cobbled courts thatare in twilight at midday and damp in the longest drought; it turnsand doubles up passages that seem blind, dodges through the verybones of tumble-down warehouses, storehouses, houses so ramshacklethat the imagination can conjure no possible use for them, and itcomes out at last into a foul thoroughfare that appears to be nobetter than a stinking alley, so close to the water\\'s edge that themasts of the river\\'s cluttered craft look as if they grew upon thedirty, sagging roofs opposite, and so near to the wharves that thegreen walls of the buildings are wet and odorous as if from acontinuous application of bilge-water.By day, when its residents are asleep, this street is loud withstraining Norman horses, and clattering vans, and whip-crackingcarters from the docks; but by night--and the nights are very darkdown there--it becomes the haunt of sailors and longshoremen, drunkand shouting, or still and drugged.  Then the blue electric lampssnap hysterically at distant corners; the uneven pavement mountssteeply upward, or dashes precipitately downward, with no warning;laughter and curses and the crash of breaking glass or splutteringoaths issue now and again from the blackness at one\\'s elbow, where,hidden among the warehouses, stand the houses for the storing ofanother sort of wares: the slave-houses maintained for mariners.Grotesque men, could you see them, stagger into dim entrances;terrible caricatures of women, if the light would show them, stealout and dart upon gutter-couched drunkards to paw their pockets.  Thenight is alive with shadows, and the whole street a hungry, quiveringquicksand.Only by urging her eyes to their utmost could Mary make out anythingof the house before which she and her unsteady companion came topause.  Even then all of which she could be sure was that, coweringunder the shadow of some huge brick building, and skulking beneathits own rotting eaves, it was a half-sunken, old, narrow house, longsince abandoned as unfit for legitimate purposes, and leaningrakishly to one side, like an ancient libertine that knows his eviland grins at it.The sailor knocked lightly at an almost unseen door.  A panel of itslid open and threw a ray of light on his face.\"Who\\'s there?\" asked a voice that was like the rasping of a file.\"It\\'s Billy,\" said the sailor.\"Billy who?\"\"Billy Stevens.  Le\\'me in, Lou.\"A pair of swollen eyes came to the open panel and looked, down theshaft of light, into the sinister face of Bill.\"Who\\'s that with you?\" croaked the voice.\"A gal I got for you.\"\"Is she all right?\"\"O\\' course she is, Lou; else what in hell\\'d she be doin\\' with me?Come on; le\\'me in.\"The swollen eyes disappeared, and the panel was shut.  There was asound of the withdrawal of several bolts.  Then the door swung open,was closed and relocked behind the newcomers, and Mary found herselfin an unfurnished hall, not more than fifteen feet square, lighted bya dim lamp standing on the lowest step of a steep flight of stairs,and guarded by the owner of the swollen eyes.At least in height, \"Big Lou\" was gigantic.  She was fully six feettall; she stooped a little and was extremely thin, with a hollowchest and narrow flanks, partially hidden by an old red cottondressing-gown; but the long arms were like flails, and Lou had atemper that did not hesitate to use them as such.  Her dirty brownhair was already touched with gray; she had almost no chin; her nosewas a smudge in her sodden face and her cheeks were heavy with yearsof drunkenness.  Her mouth hung loose and quarrelsome, and, as shebent over to look hard at Mary, her breath was foul.She addressed herself, however, entirely to the black-browed Stevens.\"Where\\'d you git her?\" she asked, as if Mary were one of the animalsnot gifted with articulate speech.Stevens told of their meeting.\"Where\\'s she from?\"The sailor gave a rapid and wholly fictitious biography.\"How old?\"\"Twenty,\" said Bill.\"I ain\\'t!\" protested Mary.But the sailor shot her an ugly look.\"Close your trap,\" he told her, and then, to Big Lou, he repeated:\"Twenty.\"Big Lou picked up the lamp and, holding it in one blackened claw,passed the other over Mary, with dexterous appraisement, fromshoulders to knees.\"I\\'ll give you a five-spot for her,\" she croaked.\"You\\'ll go to the devil,\" retorted Bill.\"Six?\"\"Ten.\"\"You\\'re a damned thief, Stevens, that\\'s what you are,\" growled theold woman.  \"I\\'ll give you seven, an\\' not another God damned cent.\"Mary leaned against the moist wall.  She was now past caring, and shehardly heard.\"Make it seven-seventy-five,\" said Bill, with sudden ingratiation.Big Lou raised the lamp again and again regarded the animal, herswollen eyes sharpening.\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do,\" she said, once more facing the sailor.\"Are you goin\\' to stop here to-night?\"\"Yes.\"\"Well, I\\'ll come up in the mornin\\' and take a closer look.  If shepasses that, I\\'ll give you seven-fifty.\"Bill\\'s brown face worked in thought, but the thirst for liquor wasupon him, and he compromised.\"All right,\" he said--\"if you\\'ll give me five down on account.\"The giantess flung aside her red dressing-gown and, from a blackcotton stocking that hung loose upon a shriveled shank, drew a fewgreasy bills.  From these she reluctantly counted five, handed themto Stevens, and returned the rest to their original place of safety.\"G\\'on up,\" she said.  \"I stay here till work\\'s done, an\\' take tolls.\"From somewhere in the shadows she produced a black flask and, asMary, with the sailor\\'s tattooed hand tightly under her arm, beganthe steep ascent, Big Lou settled herself at her post of gatekeeperupon the lowest step.Those stairs seemed almost perpendicular.  They rose out of thedarkness of the hallway at an alarming angle; each step was closeupon a foot high; they were not a yard wide, their upper half wasboxed between two walls, and they opened directly into the room thatevidently served as the parlor of Big Lou Summerton\\'s establishment.The room was small and badly lighted by a kerosene hand-lamp, whichstood upon a circular center-table and sent up a thin column of smoketo the sooty ceiling.  A spotted lounge with dilapidated springsstood in one corner; the faded paper was peeling from the plaster,and a broken stove, which glowed an angry red, heated the place to adegree that was well-nigh unbearable.  The air was stale and rancid,both from the company that was present and from a long entertainmentof similar companies, in days gone by.There were only two persons in the room.  Both were seated at thetable, both were drinking whiskey poured into ragged-edged glassesfrom a bottle that stood between them, and both were, or had been,women.  Of these one coughed so sharply and constantly between hertoothless gums, and was so shrunken under her blue calicomother-hubbard, that it was plain she would soon be nothing; whilethe other was a creature with face red and bloated, features stuntedand coarse, eyes that glowed dully, and the voice of a crow.Stevens presented Mary to them, and wasted no formalities.\"This here\\'s a new one,\" he said, and, motioning his charge to athird chair, himself pulled up a fourth.The two inmates received her with a loud duet that was almost achoral jeer.  Two more glasses were produced from a shadowy cupboard,and the drinking recommenced.Mary took one long drink and, wasted by privation, passed at once forsome time into a daze in which, though she saw all, she reckonedlittle.  She heard Stevens drop into the babbling stage ofdrunkenness; she noted that, though the women kept pace with hispotations, they poured water into their own whiskey and gin into thesailor\\'s; she saw him loll in his chair and sway over the table; shefelt his heavy head drop at last on her thin shoulder, and she didnot move while, as he lay there, his companions--now hers--wentthrough his clothes and tiptoed out of a rear door.It was then that, with a quick start, she regained control of herselfat the sound of speech below and the tread of feet on the stairs.  Arough voice had assured Big Lou that \"it was all right,\" and anothervoice was supplementing:\"Rest easy, my dear lady: we are paying as we go.  Michael, here, is,as you know, a deck-hand on the admirable yacht of my admirablefriend Marsden Payne, with whom I have been on a winter excursion;and he has kindly consented to show me his own section of little oldNew York.\"Mary knew that voice, although she could not at once identify it;but, though she sprang up so quickly that she wakened the tumblingStevens, who slipped to the floor, she could not escape before shefound herself directly regarding the flushed face, glowing gray eyes,and disordered hair of Philip Beekman.Still young and slim in his yachting clothes, he looked at her,swaying a little in the doorway, his back to those perilous stairs,and with no clear recognition.\"Hello!\" he said.  \"I think I\\'ve had the pleasure of meeting yousomewhere before.\"Mary\\'s mouth tightened.  She had herself now well in hand.  She shookher russet head.\"I guess not,\" she said.But her voice betrayed her.\"Good Lord!\" said Beekman.  The flush deepened on his face.  With onehand he snatched his yachting-cap from his black hair; the other hesuddenly held out to her, trembling.  \"Good Lord!\" he repeated, thistime with something that was nearly awe in his tone.  \"I--I--it\\'s_Violet_!  Will you----?  Won\\'t you _please_ shake hands?\"Scarcely less amazed by his manner than was he by her appearance, shetook his hand.Beekman turned to someone on the stairs behind him.\"Get out, Mike!\" he said.  \"I\\'ve found a friend.\"There was a plucking at his sleeve and the murmur of a concernedvoice from the rear.\"No,\" said Philip; \"get out.  I tell you that I have found a friend.Go down to the tall lady and hand her your money and then make tracksfor the yacht.  You may tell Mr. Payne that I shall return in anhour.\"Again a muffled protest from the dangerous stairway.\"Pardon me a moment,\" said Beekman, and turned full around.  \"Now,then,\" he continued to his guide, \"you get out.  I am perfectly wellable to take care of myself, and I want a private talk.  Do youexpect me to kick you downstairs?  No?  I should probably break yourback if I did.--Then, good-night.\"He stood there while the deckhand\\'s heavy feet clattered downward;waited until he had heard Big Lou grumblingly give Mike the means ofexit, and then he turned again to Mary.\"What,\" he rapidly began, and his handsome face grew once moreearnest, \"what in the name of heaven are you doing in this den?--No,\"he continued, raising a quick hand; \"don\\'t tell me; I remember how Isent you out of my mother\\'s house and, upon my word, I\\'m afraid tohear.  I couldn\\'t do anything else--but I don\\'t know.  Anyhow,there\\'s one thing sure: you need money.  Well, I made a little in thegame to-night--not much for Payne, but a good slice for me--and it\\'syours--it\\'s yours--the Lord knows it ought to go to you!\"She had tried to stop him until he spoke of money; but when hementioned that, she let him run on, let him search his pockets, andat last let him thrust something into her open hand.\"Here,\" he said; \"take it; take it as a favor to me; take it, andremember what I said to you in Rose\\'s.  Watch your chance; get out ofhere; and for God\\'s sake go back to your own home.\"Her fingers closed upon the bills and transferred them to herstocking; and as she did this a movement on the floor made them bothturn.Bill Stevens, whom Mary had forgotten and whom Beekman had not seen,gathered himself together, and at last stood more or less uprightupon his unsteady bowed legs.  His heavy body rocked uneasily, buthis dark face, with its bushy brows and sinister eyes, was thrustforward glowering.  One sinewy tattooed hand gripped the back of achair; the other, knotted into a hard fist, he raised slowly towardBeekman.\"It\\'s your turn to go,\" he said, with a lingering oath.  \"This here\\'smy gal; she b\\'longs to me--an\\' so does any money she gits.\"Instantly Philip was his old, assured self.  That quality which wasmost characteristic of him, that curious mixture of much that wasbitter and a little that was sweet, lighted his eyes and rang in hisvoice.\"Where do _you_ come from?\" he asked, smiling.  \"You look as if yougot out of a trap-door, like the fairy in the play.\"\"None o\\' your business where I come from,\" said Bill.  \"The point iswhere I\\'ll send you, if you ain\\'t careful.\"Mary, who did not like the looks of things, tried to interpose.  Sheput the palms of her hands against the sailor\\'s rough cheeks.\"Listen, Bill,\" she said, \"this is an old friend of mine----\"\"Likely!\" grunted Bill.\"He is, though; ain\\'t you?\" Mary appealed, with a sidelong glance atBeekman.\"Certainly I am,\" said Philip.Stevens lowered his fist, but his red eyes remained full of hate.\"I don\\'t care who you are,\" he rumbled; \"this here\\'s my woman.\"\"All right,\" said Beekman; \"that\\'s to your credit, I\\'m sure: a man isknown by the woman he keeps, and you can\\'t have a better.  Only, yousee, my friend----\"\"I ain\\'t yer friend.\"Once more Mary interposed.\"Just sit down, Bill,\" she urged.  \"Sit down an\\' have a drink withus.  You can hear all we got to say.\"Stevens sank into a chair, but when Beekman, with Mary between them,pushed the bottle toward Bill, the sailor would have none of it.\"I\\'ll stop a bit,\" he said, \"but I ain\\'t goin\\' to drink with you, an\\'you needn\\'t think it.\"Philip was still undisturbed.\"Have it your own way,\" he said.  \"I know how it is: when a man fallsin love, he swears off liquor; when he falls out of love he takes toliquor again--one sort of drunkenness is as much as he can stand at atime.  I\\'ll take a drink.\"Mary, who now began to fear acute trouble, slipped a hand to Stevens,but he drew away.\"I think I\\'ll smoke--if I may,\" continued the undisturbed Beekman.\"A pipe is domestic, a cigar is philosophic, and a cigarette is acynic: I shall have a cigarette.  William?\"--And he offered hissilver case to the sailor.\"No,\" said Stevens, shortly.Beekman tossed his head.  Mary saw his gray eyes snap.\"William,\" he said, \"you have got to learn that the best girl isnever so good as the next.  And you have got to learn manners.  Ifyou won\\'t behave yourself properly, I think you had better leave.\"Stevens\\'s fingers opened and closed slowly.\"You go to hell,\" he said.Beekman rose quietly.  His cigarette was in one hand, and with theother, instead of threatening, he pointed to the stairway.\"Run along,\" he said.Stevens jumped to his feet and crouched, like a panther ready tospring.  Mary, overturning her chair, flung her arms about him andpinioned him in an embrace.\"Don\\'t, Bill!\" she whispered, and, over her shoulder: \"Don\\'t, Mr.Beekman!  Can\\'t you two be friends?  Can\\'t you see it\\'s all right,Bill?  Can\\'t you let him alone, Mr. Beekman?  Bill, you know how muchI think of you.\"She put her lips to his rough face.  She whispered rapid, unthoughtlies into his ear.  She caressed and cajoled him, and at last, whenPhilip had been persuaded into a half-scornful apology, she managedto get Stevens out of the room and started him down the stairway toseek sympathy of Big Lou while she herself had her talk with Beekman.They sat down again at the round table and took a drink.  Philipwanted to upbraid himself for his conduct to her in his mother\\'shouse, and yet, because he felt that he could have followed no coursesave that which he had taken, he did not know how to begin: all thathe was sure of was that there was a wrong somewhere, and that he mustsomehow make confession of it.  Mary, on the other hand, was dividedbetween panic from the trouble so lately avoided and a desire to hearfrom Philip nothing approaching condolence.She sought escape in the commonplace.\"You mustn\\'t mind him,\" she said, with a nod toward the stairs downwhich the glowering Bill had departed.\"Not a bit,\" answered Beekman.  \"I only wanted to get rid of him inorder to tell you hew sorry I am for--for--oh, you know.\"\"Don\\'t talk about that, Mr. Beekman--please.\"\"But I must talk about it.\"\"Not now; not yet.  Tell me how you are.\"\"Oh, I\\'m as near right as I ever am, or ever will be.  But,Violet----\"\"You\\'re looking rich.\"His eyes followed hers to his gilt-buttoned yachting jacket.\"You can never judge a man by his clothes,\" he said.  \"Necessity isthe mother of pretension.\"\"Are you married yet?\"\"Hardly.  There are only two things that a man can\\'t honestlypromise: to love, and to cease to love.  I\\'m still too poor to affordthose lies.\"Mary only half understood his mood, but she was wholly intent onkeeping him free of dreaded topics.\"Do you hear anything of the people we used to know?\" she asked.\"Well,\" said Philip, \"Rose was let off, you know, and is back at theold address and the old business.\"  He looked at his watch andstarted.  \"By Jove,\" he continued; \"I must have been pretty tight.  Ihad no idea it was so late.  I\\'ve got to be getting back to the yachtsoon.\"He stood up, his cap in one hand.  Mary followed him to the stairdoor, and there he turned.\"Violet,\" he said, \"I am going to tell you how sorry I am.  I amgoing to tell you, whether you like to hear it or not.\"The flush had gone from his face and eyes, leaving them simple andsincere.Mary\\'s voice faltered.  She understood some things that she had neverbefore understood.\"It didn\\'t matter none,\" she replied.  \"You couldn\\'t help it.\"\"I daresay I couldn\\'t.  I don\\'t know.  These things are too much forme.  But I do know that I am sorry--sorry from the bottom of myheart.  And if I can ever do anything--anything----\"He put out his hand, and, as she took it, he raised her hand to hislips.At that instant there was a yell of rage from behind him.  Mary,springing back, saw him half turn and reel.  She saw a brown,tattooed hand close about his throat, choking his cry of alarm.  Shesaw Bill Stevens\\'s distorted face and red eyes appear above Beekman\\'sshoulder.  She saw a knife flash and bury itself deep in the youngman\\'s side.  And then, with a tremendous smash, both men disappeareddown those murderous, black stairs.It seemed to Mary that she lost not a moment in running down to them;yet, when she reached the hall, the little drama was finished.  Thesailor was lying stunned in a corner, and Big Lou, with the rescuedlamp beside her, was kneeling above Philip\\'s body and running herquick claws through his pockets.\"Damn your soul, get upstairs!\" she cried to Mary.But Mary hesitated.  Overhead she heard the skurry of skirts andhurried feet.  Before her lay the man that had once so harmed her.His coat had been torn open and a great red smear grew larger andlarger upon his white silk shirt.  His mouth was twisted, but still.His gray eyes stared at the begrimed ceiling: Philip Beekman was dead.She leaped across the body, tore back the bolts, flung open the door,and nearly fell into the pitch-black street.As she ran around the nearest corner, she heard the cry of Mike, thedeckhand, who must have been waiting nearby, and then the sharpalarm-call of a policeman\\'s night-stick.XXXHER FATHER\\'S HOUSEHer way must have led her first to the river and then well northward:she did not know.  She did not even know whether she ran or walked.All that she did know was that, at least for hours to come, she mustput as many miles as she could between her own tossing thoughts andthat still face with the staring eyes which lay at the foot of thesteep, dark stairs in Summerton\\'s.  The clocks, had she looked atthem, would have told her that the night was gone, but the winterdarkness still enveloped the city when she found herself at laststanding before an illuminated ticket-window and addressing a sleepyclerk at a ferry.\"I want a ticket,\" she said, and laid down one of the bills thatPhilip Beekman had given her.\"Where to?\" yawned the clerk.How did it happen that the name which rose to her lips was the nameof her native town--a word that she had not uttered since the morningof her awakening in the house of Rose Légère?  Perhaps it was becausethe dead man had, with almost his last words, pleaded with her to gohome; perhaps it was because that name, of which she had for so longtried never to think, was, in reality, the one always nearest to herheart; perhaps it was only because no other town was familiar to her.In any event, the name was spoken without consideration of theconsequences, and, before she had time to pause or to repent, theclerk had handed her the change, and with it the bit of pasteboardthat would bear her home.\"There\\'s a boat in ten minutes,\" he said: \"but you\\'ll have to wait anhour in Jersey City.  The first train doesn\\'t go till six-five.\"Of what immediately followed she had, thereafter, no clearrecollection.  She remembered only buying a cold sandwich and ahalf-pint of whiskey in a deserted café; crossing a bitterly cold,sullen stretch of water from a twinkling cañon to a shadowy shore;walking, for warmth, weary though she was, up and down, and up anddown, along a damp, echoing train-shed, and then, at last, passing aclanging iron gate, climbing into a coach, and falling, nearlystupefied, into an uncomfortable, red-plush covered seat.  She hadbut the faintest mental picture of changing cars, and none at all ofany subsequent incident, until, in a black dawn, there flashed uponher, from between the frost-figures on the window, a bit of landscapethat warned her she was approaching home.The track came suddenly to the river-side.  Beneath a gray sky,which, though the morning was well advanced, the sun seemed afraid toclimb, there raced the mile-and-a-half wide strip of gray water.  Itcrashed across a ruined dam; it swept above a submerged \"chute\"through which, years before, the big pine-rafts from the upperAlleghanies used to be hurled on their way to the Chesapeake.  Therehad been a thaw: only here and there could Mary see the ominouscrests of the rocks that threatened the mid-channel; the islands,with trees bare of foliage, were under water, and far away, from thecloudy York County shore, the high hills rose above the mist, dun andcheerless, forbidding and cold.  With a quick catch in her throat,she saw the river-road that she had so often tramped on holidays, nowaxle-deep in mud.  Over there were the leafless woods where, when theboughs were green, the children used to picnic, and here, nearer thetown, where patches of soiled snow hid under the stunted pines, wasthe path where one time came, for pink laurel branches, a girl thatshe had been.  The engine whistled sharply and stopped.Mary mechanically readjusted the hat that she had not touched sinceshe had put it on for the work of the evening previous--the eveningso long ago.  She stepped to the platform.The station was just as it had always been.  It looked smaller anddirtier, but she knew that it had not changed; and a sharp pain shotthrough her heart at the realization that, in this town, everythinghad gone on its placid way while so much had been happening to one ofits children.  There were the same grinning gamins waiting for theNew York newspapers; the same negro porters from the two hotels; thesame station-master \"calling the train,\" just as he used to call itin the days when she had watched the outgoing coaches with enviouslongings for a sight of the strange lands toward which they werebound.Then, as her aching feet touched the cinder of the thoroughfare, sherealized her danger.  She had no plan, no scheme of accounting forherself; some unreasoned impulse, partly, doubtless, the primalinstinct that drives the wounded beast to its den, had overcome herfears and turned her face in the direction of the home whither shehad, for so long, dreaded to return.  But now she was seized with aterror of recognition by the townspeople, and so she lowered her headand walked, with the swiftness of panic, among the little knot ofloafers about the station-door.Now that she was here, what was she to say, what to do, where toturn?  She moved, unable to evolve any order from the chaos of herthoughts.  She could only go over and over the memory of that lastday in school; the early violets, purple and fragrant, peepingthrough the lush grass on the lawns of Second Street; the flamingoriole in the Southwark yard; the lazy sunlight flowing through theopen windows of Miss England\\'s sleepy classroom.  Mary\\'s blue eyeswere bright then, her mouth was red, her cheeks pink; lithe,strong-limbed, and firm of body, her walk had owned the easy, languidgrace of a wild animal.  And now, the lawns were bare; only a fewpersistent sparrows hopped in the gutters and along the ground; thesky was empty of sunlight, and she----She came to a supreme pause.  Habit had led her aimless feet.  Shewas standing, in the full morning, before the two-story brick housethat was her father\\'s home.She knew that the door remained unlocked from dawn to night; but shedid not at once enter.  She was afraid to go in, afraid to standstill, afraid to go away.Then, from the next house, came decision.  It was Etta\\'s, her marriedsister\\'s place, and she heard someone within it rattle at its door.Anything was better than a meeting with Etta: Mary quietly opened thedoor to her father\\'s house and slipped inside.She went down the brief, darkened hallway, past the drawn curtains ofthe parlor, through the twilight of the dining-room, and stopped atthe open entrance to the small, crowded kitchen, where, among neatlyarranged and brightly polished pots and pans, her mother was bendingover the glowing stove.Mrs. Denbigh looked up with a start.  Still stooped, stillhatchet-faced, but grayer and more shrunken, she stood there, hersleeves rolled from her thin forearms, her forehead wet by presentlabor, her mouth set hard by labors gone.\"Get out o\\' here!\" she said.\"Mom!\"Mary raised and spread her arms in quick petitioning, and then, inthat stranger, Mrs. Denbigh recognized her child.\"_You?_\" she cried.She dashed her damp hands to her checkered apron; she stepped towardher daughter with her own arms wide.  She bent to kiss her--and shedrew as suddenly away.\"There\\'s liquor on your breath!\" she gasped.\"I know,\" said Mary, her voice low and trembling.  \"I--I ain\\'t beenwell, mom.\"The kiss was given, but less abandonedly than it had promised, and,as the mother drew away, her keen eyes searched the girl from face tofeet.  Over the multitude of maternal questions there rose the threefor which Mary was least prepared.\"Mary--what is it?  Where is he?  Didn\\'t he treat you right?\"They caught the girl at her weakest point.\"Who?\" she asked.\"Who?\"--Mrs. Denbigh\\'s eyes grew stern again.--\"Who?  You needn\\'t sayno more than that still!  I ought to have knowed when I seen you.Nobody could look at you yet and not know.  Why, you\\'re--you\\'re_old_!  Your things are worn out.  You----\" her tone increased toloud accusations.  \"Where did you get them clothes?\"Mary\\'s lips faltered.\"I bought \\'em,\" she said.\"Did anybody see you come in here?\"\"I don\\'t know.--No, nobody did.\"\"Thank God for that!\"  Mrs. Denbigh pointed a long, gnarled finger ather daughter.  She pointed it at the bedraggled hat, still bearingtraces of a finery too pronounced for that small town.  She pointedto the waist and to the skirt.  \"It\\'s true, then!\" she cried.  \"It\\'strue, then!  You\\'ve been a bad woman!\"In the doorway Mary swayed.  She leaned heavily against the wall.She was too tired to lie.\"Yes,\" she whispered.\"Yes,\" her mother echoed; \"yes--an\\' you own up to it!  The whole townsaid it; your pop said it; they all told me yet--an\\' I stood up feryou; I showed \\'em your letter; I says you was married; I kep\\' onbelievin\\' you\\'d write; I stuck to it--an\\' now you come here to shameme.  You come here when you\\'re worn out--when no one else\\'ll haveyou--you come here, brazen, not carin\\' still, a bad woman--_a badwoman_--an\\' I guess you think I\\'ll take you in!\"Her poor face writhed.  Her dim eyes shot fire.  Her withered breastsrose and fell in a spasm of indignation and wounded pride.Mary, still leaning against the kitchen wall, put out her hands as ifto ward away a blow.\"Don\\'t, mom,\" she said.  \"Please don\\'t.\"\"I will!  I\\'ve a mind to beat you.  I\\'d like to know what possessedyou to flaunt yourself in this place.  You can\\'t stay here.  Youcan\\'t stay in this house that you\\'ve shamed still, an\\' you can\\'t stayin this town.\"\"Mom!\"\"You can\\'t stay in this town.  Do you hear that?  If you do, if youtry to stay here and mock me, a decent woman, I\\'ll have you arrested;I\\'ll have you sent to the lock-up; I\\'ll----\"\"Mom,\" interrupted Mary.  \"I won\\'t hurt you.  I didn\\'t mean to hurtnobody.  I didn\\'t come here to do no harm.\"\"How kin you come here yet without doin\\' harm?  Ain\\'t you done enoughwithout comin\\' back here to shame your own folks?\"\"But, mom,\" Mary pleaded, \"I won\\'t shame nobody; I\\'ll do whatever yousay.\"Little Mrs. Denbigh collapsed upon a kitchen chair.  She rocked fromside to side.  She fanned herself with her checkered apron; griefconquered anger; and long dried tears came at last to her old eyesand coursed, unrestrained, down her hard cheeks.\"What did I ever do fer to deserve this?\" she moaned.  \"What did Iever do to receive this judgment?  A child o\\' mine!  A child o\\' mine!An\\' her the baby that she was!  Didn\\'t her pop an\\' me bring her upthe best we could?  Ain\\'t I always lived accordin\\' to the Lord\\'sword?  What have I done to deserve this?\"Mary stepped to the weeping woman\\'s side.  She put her fingers to thegray hair and stroked it, timidly.\"Go away!\" cried the mother.  \"Don\\'t you dare to touch me!  Don\\'t youdare yet to pollute me!  Oh!  A child o\\' mine to do this!\"She fell into another paroxysm of grief, and Mary sank to her kneesand took one of the gnarled hands between her own hands.\"Listen, mom,\" she said; \"I\\'ll tell you all about it, an\\' then you\\'llknow.\"She did tell her, as much as she dared; but Mrs. Denbigh only halfunderstood.  The elder woman\\'s life had been cast in a mold; it hadlong since hardened into a destined shape, and no sympathy on her ownpart, no explanations on the part of another, could alter her.  Direnecessity she had often known, but she had not known it amidsurroundings where the sufferer\\'s only course was that which alonehad been possible for Mary.  If she softened, it was not because shecomprehended, but because Mary was her child.\"Don\\'t tell me no more,\" she said at last.  \"You could \\'a\\' gone towork.\"\"I tried that, an\\' nobody\\'d have me.\"\"You could \\'a\\' gone to some church-folk.\"\"I did, but they couldn\\'t get me a job.\"\"You could \\'a\\' gone to some institution a\\'ready.\"\"How\\'d I have lived after I come out?\"\"Well, you shouldn\\'t \\'a\\' run away in the first place.  Didn\\'t wetreat you right?\"To have answered that question in the negative would not have been tobe altogether true, and Mary did not even yet see enough clearly todiscern that the conditions which had driven her from home wereeconomic forces that made parents and child equally blameless.\"Can\\'t I stay here?\" she appealed.  \"Can\\'t I please stay here an\\'work for you?\"Mrs. Denbigh shook her head.\"I\\'d work hard.  I\\'d help you.  I wouldn\\'t never complain.  All Iwant is just to be quiet.  I\\'d work hard.  Nobody\\'d never know.\"\"It\\'d be all over town by evenin\\' still.\"\"No, it wouldn\\'t.  I\\'d say I was a widow.  I\\'d say----\"\"Think o\\' your pop,\" sobbed Mrs. Denbigh.  \"Why, he\\'d--he\\'d kill you,Mary!\"  The mother shivered as she considered the wrath of the giant,whom hard work had hardened past the touch of all the tendereremotions.  \"He\\'d just beat you up an\\' throw you into the street foreverybody to see!\"  She half rose in a new anxiety.  \"Why, he\\'s onthe early shift, an\\' he might come here \\'most any minute.  Etta mightcome in, an\\' Sallie\\'ll be back from school soon.\"\"But, mom,\" Mary blindly persisted.  \"I\\'d work so hard!  I wouldn\\'tnever be cross.  I\\'d help you.  I\\'d do all the housework, an\\' youcould teach me to cook the way you do.\"\"We got to think o\\' Sallie yet,\" continued Mrs. Denbigh.  \"Every timeshe gets mad now she says she\\'ll run away like you done.  We got tothink o\\' her.  She\\'s a growin\\' girl, an\\' what\\'d it be to have youaround her?\"\"But, mom, I won\\'t hurt her.  Can\\'t I just stay an\\' work, an\\' washdishes, an\\' such things?  I wouldn\\'t mind washin\\' dishes\"--Marysmiled wanly--\"like I once did.\"\"An\\' then there\\'s Etta,\" said the mother, still busied in her ownconfusion.  \"She\\'s got a baby----\"\"A baby!\"  Mary\\'s heart leaped.\"Such a lovely baby girl----\"\"Can\\'t I----?  Oh, mom, can\\'t I just get a peep at it?\"\"How could you?--An\\' we have to think what it\\'d be for her if you washere an\\' she growed up.\"The prodigal choked with tears.\"Mom, mom!\" she pleaded.  \"How\\'d I hurt \\'em?  You don\\'t thinkI\\'d----?\"\"The town\\'d think so, an\\' the town\\'d tell \\'em so, too.  An\\' anyways,Mary, we\\'re poor, we\\'re dreadful poor.  The mill was shut down allsummer an\\' fall.  It\\'s only just started a\\'ready, an\\' it\\'s onlyworkin\\' half-time now.  We ain\\'t had money fer months still, an\\' nowit all goes fer old bills.  We couldn\\'t do it, even if we wanted to.\"For half an hour more Mary begged, but she begged in vain; and thoughthe mother ended by another attack of tears, and though the two wepttogether in each other\\'s arms, they knew that they were together forthe last time.\"Your clothes are so thin!\" quavered Mrs. Denbigh, with a patheticendeavor to sink her grief in practical anxiety.  \"You ain\\'t got nocoat, an\\' your feet are near on the ground still.\"Mrs. Denbigh had no money; there was literally not a cent in thehouse; but she unearthed from an old trunk, and pressed, for pawning,upon Mary, a heavy, old-fashioned gold bracelet, which had been awedding-present; and, though the daughter protested that she hadmoney enough to buy some clothes, the mother got her own coat uponthe daughter\\'s shoulders.They were still standing in the kitchen, as women awaiting thesummons of death, when first one steam-whistle and then another beganto call across the town.  It was noon, and the moment of puddlerDenbigh\\'s return.Without a word they walked, hand in hand, across the short back-yard,for Mary, it was tacitly agreed, must not risk an appearance upon thestreet in the neighborhood of her father\\'s house.  Without a word,Mrs. Denbigh\\'s knotted fingers opened the latch of the white-washedgate.  Without a word mother and daughter flung themselves into eachother\\'s arms again, and then, still in silence, Mary trudged away.She did not look back until she came to the first corner, and, whenshe got there, she saw her mother\\'s shrunken body still at the gate,the old hand waving, the aproned figure shaking with sobs.  It wasstill there when Mary reached the second corner; but when she turnedat the third, it was gone.Her pain was no longer poignant.  Grief had reached the mark whenceit passes to stupefaction; and Mary pursued her way as if her actionswere those suggested to a subject of hypnotic control.  In order toavoid the crowd at the station, she walked on up the alley, until thealley ended in an intersecting turnpike along which ran the trolleyline to the county-town.  She waited there, stolidly, for a car,mounted that, descended at the end of the road, and, after anotherdelay, climbed upon a train that would take her without change toJersey City.  For nearly twenty-four hours she had eaten nothing; butshe bought another small flask at the terminus, and, as theferry-boat glided between the creaking slips into the tossing water,she took a deep draught of whiskey.She walked to the stern and looked over the side.  It was night.Here gleamed the railway signs under which the boat had justpassed--the signs of those roads that, she had now discovered, endedas fatally for her freedom as if they had ended in an insurmountablewall.  Ahead towered the other walls, the black walls of that livingprison--that vast, malevolent, conscious jail--into which she hadonce gone with such a store of hopes whereof not one had ever beenfulfilled, of anticipated pleasures whereof not one had ever beentasted, and to which she must now, to serve out a life-sentence,return.Must she return?She looked up and down the dismal river, crowded with traffickingcraft, and she remembered that other river at home as she had seen iton the spring afternoon when she had played the truant from school.She remembered the swirling eddies across which the nearer hills hadbeen changing from brown to green; she remembered the descendingDonegal Valley, fresh with germinating life, the flowering shrubs,and the sap-wet trees along the shore, the scent of a warm April, andthe music of the Susquehanna.  These things she remembered, and thenshe looked again at the nearing city.Must she return?She touched the rail.  Over that lay certain escape.  The deck wasdeserted; the movement would be quick; the plunge----She leaned forward, she saw the leaping, greedy, icy waves, and, witha loud sob, staggered back to the bench that ran along the exteriorof the upper saloon.She could not do it.  With nothing but suffering and horrors to livefor, she could not put an end to life.  She was afraid of the cold;she was afraid of the struggle; she was afraid of the pang; she wasafraid of Death.  It was a new thing--Death; she had been afraid ofit ever since that morning of her awakening when the thought ofseeking it had first occurred to her.  Since her first crossing ofthis water, her experiences had been a procession of new things, eachmore terrible than the last; she had come to dread the new, and thisnovelty of death she dreaded lest it should be the most terrible ofall.  Life, which had robbed her of everything else, had, at thislast, robbed her of the courage to quit it.Youth, hope, purity, strength, beauty, the ability to work, even lustand hate--all these were dead within her, dead beyond possibility ofresurrection.  If Max had only given her a child!  If he, or anyoneof the others, had only killed her!  But they had murdered Love, andthe only thing that lived in her was the fear of death.Out of the bitterness of her own heart, out of the abysses of her ownknowledge of things as they are, she saw much of the truth.  A raregood fortune had favored Katie Flanagan; but Mary, her parents, Roseand her girls, Carrie, Policeman Riley and Magistrate Dyker, evenAngel and Max--not one of them, well regarded, could be unequivocallycondemned.  They were all, preying or preyed upon, an inevitableresult.  They were but the types of millions everywhere.  New Yorkitself, with all its women-slaves and men-slaves, must be but anillustration of what the other cities of the world are and have been.No rescue of a slave could put an end to the slavery.  Something waswrong; but what that something was, or how it was ever to be maderight, she could not guess.  She knew only that, down the years,wherever walked the great god Poverty, that great god ledProstitution by the hand.Finally comprehending, if unable to formulate, these things, at teno\\'clock that night Mary Denbigh, remembering what Philip Beekman hadtold her, rang the doorbell of a familiar house and faced what shewould once have feared more than death--she faced complacent,untroubled, prosperous, and protected Rose Légère.The woman, still the good-natured woman of the brewery-calendar, cutshort Mary\\'s flow of apologies.\"Ferget it,\" she said.  \"It don\\'t matter what you did.  You didn\\'tknow any better.  Here: just take this ten dollars and tell me whatelse I can do for you.\"And Mary pushed the money away.\"I don\\'t want that,\" she said.  \"I want--oh, Miss Rose, won\\'t youplease take me back?\"But Rose, surveying the human ruin before her, shook, verypositively, her masses of yellow hair.\"No,\" she answered, \"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t do that.  It wouldn\\'t begood business.  You see, the life\\'s got you, Violet: you\\'re all in.\"_EDITOR\\'S NOTE__The facts presented in the \"House of Bondage\" are so startling as toseem incredible.  They are, however, well known to those who havebecome familiar with the problem of the social evil, and can beduplicated indefinitely from court records, the findings of variousinvestigating bodies, such as the Congressional Commission, whosereport on this subject is known as Senate Document No. 196, ImportingWomen for Immoral Purposes, being a partial report from theImmigration Commission on the Importation and Harboring of Women forImmoral Purposes, published December 10, 1909, a book entitled\"Panders and Their White Slaves,\" by Clifford G. Roe, in which theauthor gives in detail many cases successfully prosecuted by him inChicago in the last year or two; and from the sworn testimony takenbefore the special Grand Jury appointed in New York in January, 1910,to investigate the so-called White Slave Traffic, the full report ofwhich investigation follows._WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC_Presentment of the Additional Grand Jury for the January Term of theCourt of General Sessions in the County of New York, in the matter ofthe investigation as to the alleged existence in the County of NewYork of an organized traffic in women for immoral purposes.__Filed June 29, 1910_  COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS IN AND FOR  THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK._In the matter of the investigation as to the alleged existence inthe County of New York of an organized traffic in women for immoralpurposes._  To the Hon. THOMAS C. O\\'SULLIVAN, Judge of the  Court of General Sessions.Sir:We, the members of the Additional Grand Jury for the January term,1910, respectfully present as follows:In the charge delivered to us by Your Honor on the 3rd day ofJanuary, 1910, Your Honor said:\"There have been spread broadcast in the public prints statementsthat the City of New York is a center or clearing house for anorganized traffic in women for immoral purposes, or what has come tobe known as the \\'white slave\\' traffic.  Some of these statements mayhave been published with ulterior motive and may have been meresensationalism, but some are said to be based upon officialinvestigation and charges made by persons who profess to haveknowledge of the fact.* * * * * * *\"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main objects:First, the procuring of women of previous chaste character, whothrough force, duress, or deceit are finally made to live lives ofprostitution; second, the procuring of women who are alreadyprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where theymay ply their trade.* * * * * * * *\"But the main object, gentlemen, which I desire you to keep in mindthroughout your investigation is the uncovering not alone of isolatedoffenses, but of an organization, if any such exists, for a trafficin the bodies of women.\"You should make your investigation sufficiently broad to cover notonly present conditions, but also conditions existing in the pastwithin the statute of limitations.\"I charge you that it is your duty to pursue this inquiry into everychannel open to you and to present to the court the facts found byyou.\"Pursuant to Your Honor\\'s instructions, we have made an investigationinto the matters referred to in Your Honor\\'s charge.  We have calledbefore our body every person whom we could find who we had reason tobelieve might have information on the subject.  Among others were thefollowing: a member of the National Immigration Commission assignedto investigate conditions relating to importing, seducing, anddealing in women in the City of New York; the author of an articlewhich appeared in _McClure\\'s Magazine_ for November, 1909, entitled\"The Daughters of the Poor\"; a former under sheriff in the County ofEssex, New Jersey; the President of the New York Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Children; the author of a pamphlet entitled\"The White Slave Traffic\"; a member of the New York State ImmigrationCommission appointed by Governor Hughes in 1908; a former PoliceCommissioner of the City of New York; detectives and other agentsespecially employed in connection with this investigation; membersand ex-members of the New York Independent Benevolent Association;witnesses in the specific cases presented to this Grand Jury, as wellas a number of other citizens.  In addition, the foreman, theDistrict Attorney and his Assistants, have interviewedrepresentatives of the following organizations:The Committee of Fourteen; its Research Committee;The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children;The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice;The Charity Organization Society;The Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor;The Committee on Amusements and Vacation Resources of Working Girls;The Society for Social and Moral Prophylaxis;The Florence Crittenden Mission;The New York Probation Association;The Headworkers of various Social Settlements;The Women\\'s Municipal League;The Society for the Prevention of Crime;The Bureau of Municipal Research.We also published in the daily press of this city on the 6th day ofMay the following:\"The Additional Grand Jury, sworn in in January by Judge O\\'Sullivanof the Court of General Sessions, was charged with the investigationof the truth or falsity of certain statements which had been publiclymade during the past few months to the effect that the City of NewYork is a center or clearing house for an organized traffic in womenfor immoral purposes, or what has come to be known as the\\'white-slave traffic.\\'\"Pursuant to this charge the Grand Jury has been seeking legalevidence on this subject from all available sources.  The informationwhich many citizens have volunteered to give has proved in most casesto be general rather than specific.\"Before closing its investigation the Grand Jury desires to announcepublicly that it will be glad to receive definite, specificinformation as to the existence in this county of any traffic inwomen for immoral purposes from any citizen or official or otherindividual who has such information.  Those who are willing to assistthe Grand Jury in its investigation are asked to call at the officeof James B. Reynolds, Assistant District Attorney, Criminal CourtBuilding (within the next week).  It will save the time of manyindividuals and of Mr. Reynolds if only those appear who are willingand able to present facts regarding the specific matter above stated.\"On behalf of the Additional January Grand Jury.  \"JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, JR.,      \"Foreman.\"As a part of this investigation evidence has been presented to us andwe have found 54 indictments:22 for rape;16 for abduction;10 for maintaining disorderly houses, 7 of which were Raines-LawHotels;6 for the violation of Section 2460 of the Penal Law, entitled\"Compulsory Prostitution of Women.\"We have found no evidence of the existence in the County of New Yorkof any organization or organizations, incorporated or otherwise,engaged as such in the traffic in women for immoral purposes, norhave we found evidence of an organized traffic in women for immoralpurposes.It appears, on the other hand, from indictments found by us and fromthe testimony of witnesses that a trafficking in the bodies of womendoes exist and is carried on by individuals acting for their ownindividual benefit, and that these persons are known to each otherand are more or less informally associated.We have also found that associations and clubs, composed mainly orwholly of those profiting from vice, have existed, and that one suchassociation still exists.  These associations and clubs are analogousto commercial bodies in other fields, which, while not directlyengaged in commerce, are composed of individuals all of whom asindividuals are so engaged.The \"incorporated syndicates\" and \"international bands\" referred toin published statements, we find to be such informal relations ashave just been spoken of, while the \"international headquarters,\"\"clearing houses\" and \"pretentious clubhouses\" mentioned are cafés orother so-called \"hang-outs\" where people interested in the variousbranches of the business resort.  These and the houses ofprostitution are also referred to as \"markets.\"The \"dealers\" and \"operators\" are the so-called \"pimps\" and\"procurers,\" the \"pimp\" being referred to as the \"retailer\" and themanager of houses as the \"wholesaler.\"The only association composed mainly or wholly of those profitingfrom vice, of the present existence of which we have evidence, is theNew York Independent Benevolent Association, organized in this cityin 1894 and incorporated in 1896.  This association has had anaverage membership of about 100.  Its alleged purpose is to assistits members in case of illness, to give aid in case of death, and toassure proper burial rites.After an exhaustive investigation into the activities of theassociation and of its members we find no evidence that theassociation as such does now or has ever trafficked in women, butthat such traffic is being or has been carried on by various membersas individuals.  We find that the members of this association arescattered in many cities throughout the United States.  From thetestimony adduced it appears probable that the social relations ofthe members and the opportunity thereby afforded of communicatingwith one another in various cities have facilitated the conduct oftheir individual business.On one occasion where a member was convicted of maintaining adisorderly house and a fine of $l,000 was imposed upon him in theCity of Newark, New Jersey, the association voted $500 for his aid.On another occasion in the City of Newark, New Jersey, where severalof the members of the association were arrested on the charge ofkeeping and maintaining disorderly houses, and one member was inprison, the then President went to Newark, declared to the UnderSheriff that he was the President of the New York IndependentBenevolent Association, and entered into negotiations with theauthorities in Newark on behalf of the members who had been arrested.We have, however, no evidence of any such instance in the County ofNew York.It appears from the testimony of various members and ex-members ofthe said association that its membership is almost entirely composedof persons who are now or have been engaged in the operation ofdisorderly houses or who are living or have lived directly orindirectly upon the proceeds of women\\'s shame.  None of thesewitnesses, in answer to specific questions, could name more than oneor two present or past members whose record did not show them to havelived at some time upon the proceeds of prostitution in one form oranother.  They claim, however, that all members who have beenconvicted of a crime are expelled from the organization when theproof of that fact has been submitted, the offense apparently beingnot the commission of a crime, but conviction.  It would appear thatthis procedure is for the purpose of protecting the individual ifpossible, and, failing in that, of freeing the association fromcriticism.Finding no evidence of an organized traffic in women, but of atraffic carried on by individuals, we have made a special and carefulinvestigation along this line.  Owing to the publicity given to theinquiry at its inception, it has been difficult to get legal evidenceof the actual purchase and sale of women for immoral purposes, andour investigators have been informed in different quarters that anumber of formerly active dealers in women had either temporarilygone out of business or had transferred their activities to othercities.  However, five self-declared dealers in women had agreed uponvarious occasions to supply women to our agents, but because of theirextreme caution and the fear aroused by the continued sitting of thisGrand Jury, these promises were fulfilled in only two instances, ineach of which two girls were secured for our agents at a price, inthe one case of $60 each and in the other of $75 each.  Indictmentshave been found against these two persons; one pleaded guilty and theother was convicted on trial.All of these parties boasted to our investigators of their extensivelocal and interstate operations in the recent past.  Theyspecifically mentioned the cities to which they had forwarded womenand described their operations as having at that time been free fromdanger of detection.Our investigators also testified as to the methods and means used bythese people in replenishing the supply of women and in entrappinginnocent girls.Quoting again from Your Honor\\'s charge:\"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main objects:First, the procuring of women of previous chaste character, whothrough force, duress, or deceit are finally made to live lives ofprostitution; second, the procuring of women who are alreadyprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where theymay ply their trade.\"Under the first heading, namely, the procuring of women of previouschaste character, we find the most active force to be the so-called\"pimp.\"  There are in the County of New York a considerable andincreasing number of these creatures who live wholly or in part uponthe earnings of girls or women who practice prostitution.  Withpromises of marriage, of fine clothing, of greater personalindependence, these men often induce girls to live with them andafter a brief period, with threats of exposure or of physicalviolence, force them to go upon the streets as common prostitutes andto turn over the proceeds of their shame to their seducers, who livelargely, if not wholly, upon the money thus earned by their victims.This system is illustrated in an indictment and conviction where thedefendant by such promises induced a girl of fifteen to leave herhome and within two weeks put her on the streets as a commonprostitute.We find also that these persons ill-treat and abuse the women withwhom they live and beat them at times in order to force them togreater activity and longer hours of work on the streets.  This isillustrated in the case of another defendant who was indicted andconvicted for brutally slashing with a knife the face of \"his girl\"and leaving her disfigured for life, merely because she was no longerwilling to prostitute herself for his benefit.In this connection mention should be made of the moving picture showsas furnishing to this class of persons an opportunity for leadinggirls into a life of shame.  These shows naturally attract largenumbers of children, and while the law provides that no child underthe age of sixteen shall be allowed to attend them unaccompanied byparent or guardian, it is a fact, as shown by the number of arrestsand convictions that the law is frequently violated.  Evidence uponwhich indictments have been found and convictions subsequentlysecured, has been given which shows that, in spite of the activitiesof the authorities in watching these places, many girls owe theirruin to frequenting them.  An instance of the above is the case of adefendant indicted by this Grand Jury and convicted before YourHonor, where three girls met as many young men at a Harlem movingpicture show.  At the end of the performance, the young men weretaken by an employee of the place through a door in the rear into aconnecting building--used as a fire exit for the moving pictureshow--where they met the girls and all passed the night together.The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has furnishedstatistics showing that since the 13th day of December, 1906, 33cases of rape and seduction originated in moving picture shows, insome instances the perpetrators being the employees of the shows.It is not the purpose of this reference to bring an indictmentagainst the moving picture show, which under proper restrictions maybe an important and valuable educational and recreative factor, butrather to point out possible dangers inherent in performances carriedon in the darkness and the importance of the observance of safeguardsby parents or guardians, and of the strict enforcement of the law forthe protection of children.Under the second heading in that portion of Your Honor\\'s chargequoted above, which refers to the procuring of women who are alreadyprostitutes and placing them with their consent in houses where theymay ply their trade, the Grand Jury has made a special study of theclass of disorderly houses commonly known as \"Raines-Law Hotels,\" thechief business of many of which is to provide a place where women ofthe streets may take their customers.  The testimony given shows thatgirls who brought their patrons to certain hotels of this class wereallowed rebates on the amount charged their patrons for rooms.  Uponthe evidence brought before us, indictments were found against sevenof the most notorious of these hotels.The abuse which has grown up in the conversion of the so-calledmassage and manicure parlor into a disorderly house, frequently ofthe most perverted kind, has received our careful study under thissame heading.  A special investigation has been made of some 125massage and manicure parlors, in this county.  Less than half ofthese establishments were found to be equipped for legitimatepurposes, most of them being nothing but disorderly houses.  Theoperators in such places had no knowledge of massage treatment, andin certain cases where certificates of alleged massage instituteswere on the walls of the premises they frankly admitted that they hadno training in massage and did not even know the persons whosesignatures appeared on the certificates.In view of the above, it would seem important that these parlorsshould be licensed by the Health Department of the city and that alloperators in them should also have a license from some approvedhealth or medical authority, and further, that proper supervisionshould be exercised to insure their operation for the legitimatepurposes for which they are licensed.The spreading of prostitution in its various forms from thewell-known disorderly house into apartment and tenement housespresents a very grave danger to the home.  It is inevitable thatchildren who have daily evidence of the apparent comfort, ease, andoftentimes luxury in which women of this class live should not onlybecome hardened to the evil, but be easily drawn into the life.  Theexisting laws for the suppression of this vice in apartment andtenement houses should be most rigorously enforced and if necessaryadditional legislation enacted.But of the evils investigated under this head, the most menacing isthe so-called \"pimp\" who, as already stated, while often active inseducing girls, is, to what seems to be an increasing extent, livingon the earnings of the professional prostitute, constantly driven byhim to greater activity and more degrading practices.We do not find that these persons are formally organized, but itwould appear that the majority of the women of the street, as well asmany of those who practice prostitution in houses or flats, arecontrolled by them and usually pay their entire earnings to them.They prescribe the hours and working places for these women, assistthem in getting customers, protect them from interference whenpossible, and when the women are arrested do what they can to procuretheir release.  While \"their women\" are at work, they spend much oftheir time in saloons and other resorts where they gather socially.Although operating individually, their common interest leads them tocoöperate for mutual protection or for the recovery of women who maydesert them, and for the maintenance of their authority over theirparticular women.  It is an unwritten law among these men that theauthority of the individual over the woman or women controlled by himis unquestioned by his associates to whatever extreme it may becarried.To obtain a conviction against one of this class is most difficult,for through fear or personal liking, \"his woman\" is loath to become awitness against him, and without her evidence conviction is almostimpossible.Whatever one may think of the woman who adopts the profession of aprostitute by choice, all must agree that the man who in cold bloodexploits a woman\\'s body for his own support and profit is vile anddespicable beyond expression.  Only through the arousing of anintelligent and determined public sentiment which will back up theforces of law in their effort to ferret out and bring to justice themembers of this debased class, is there hope of stamping out thosevilest of human beings found to-day in the leading cities of this andother lands.--------In view of the foregoing we recommend:1. That no effort be spared in bringing to justice the so-called\"pimp.\"  When the character and prevalence of these creatures aremore fully realized and public sentiment aroused regarding them, theinadequate punishment now imposed should be increased and everylegitimate means devised and put into execution to exterminate them.2. That the existing laws be more rigidly enforced to safeguard thepatrons of the moving picture shows, and that parents and guardiansexercise more careful supervision over their children in connectionwith their attendance upon these shows.3. That vigorous efforts be made to minimize the possibility of theRaines-Law Hotel becoming a disorderly house, and that wherenecessary proper supervision and inspection looking toward that endbe provided.4. That the so-called massage and manicure parlors be put under thecontrol of the Health Department; that a license from this departmentbe required for their operation; that certificates be granted tooperators only by some approved medical authority, and that propermeasures be taken to enforce these laws.5. That the laws relating to prostitution in apartment and tenementhouses be rigidly enforced, and that the present laws be supplementedif necessary.6. That a commission be appointed by the Mayor to make a carefulstudy of the laws relating to and the methods of dealing with thesocial evil in the leading cities of this country and of Europe, witha view to devising the most effective means of minimizing the evil inthis city.

The head of the table will contain the values: \"Snowball\" and \"WordNetLemmatizer\". The table must contain only words that give different results in the process of stemming and lemmatization (for example, the word \"running\"). The table will contain the results for the first NW words from the text (the number of rows will obviously be less than NW, as not all words match the requirements). For example, NW=500. Try to print only distinct results inside the table (for example, if a word has two occurnces inside the text, and matches the requirments for appearing in the table, it should have only one corresponding row)."

This means printing the window of text (words on consecutive positions) of length N, that has the givend word W in the middle. For example, for the text \"\"I have two dogs and a cat. Do you have pets too? My cat likes to chase mice. My dogs like to chase my cat.\" and a window of length 3, the concordance data for the word \"cat\" would be [\"dogs\", \"cat\", \"pets\"] and [\"pets\",\"cat\", \"likes\"] (we consider the text without stopwords and punctuation). However, as you can see, the window of text may contain words from different sentences. Create a second function that prints windows of texts that contain words only from the phrase containing word W. We want to print concordance data for all the inflexions of word W."
